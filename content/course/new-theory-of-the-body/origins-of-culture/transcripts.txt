## Cohort 1

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.160
don't put your blame on

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.840
me okay welcome everybody I'd like to

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.719
welcome anishka uh we met her in The

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.800
Parallax course she is a forest to be

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
reckoned with so don't fool around with

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.039
her

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.240
um yeah which is I'm great to see her

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.800
here we'll have some late skis coming

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.960
here for a little bit okay

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.120
so um adisha is perfectly capable of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.480
jumping right in uh with the material

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600
and with great questions I don't have a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.840
problem with that sometimes we spend a

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680
little more time kind of nurturing and

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
grooming new people but uh yeah we're

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.039
just gonna wing it and uh we'll be we'll

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.480
be good with that um

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.239
so I am going to show you you a very

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.000
very crude drawing that came to me today

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.439
I didn't tidy it up um but just to give

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.119
you a sense of what we've been doing

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.720
this year how it lives in my

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.479
imagination um different things that uh

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.200
we've done uh throughout the year and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.720
some of it last year because I really

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.799
think

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.520
that we're creating something

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.520
thing um and um it's kind of like those

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.960
stories sometimes you used to see them a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.720
lot maybe because I'm not on the right

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.360
part of the internet but you'd see these

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.479
stories of uh girls that had babies and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.960
they didn't know they were pregnant

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.360
right I don't know if these things are

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.840
true but they used to be popular stories

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.680
and it's kind of something like that

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.280
like we've been creating something but

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399
we don't didn't really know what it is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.039
that we're creating but it seems to be

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.280
getting more real all the time um and I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.759
find that somewhat

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.360
scary uh yeah but um it seems like it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.560
you know something's happening so I just

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.519
want to give this very

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:27.879
um um bad rendition of that um and let's

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.560
see okay so can you you see my screen

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680
it's like a really lousy drawing okay

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.640
let's I'm GNA take this and put it out

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.840
here for a second

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.239
um come on okay I'm just gonna I'm gonna

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.239
cut it first okay so here's a a really

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.800
bad drawing and what it is is we spent

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.319
most of the Year putting the Mind back

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.440
into the body so that the body envelops

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.159
and includes the mind it doesn't happen

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.720
the other way around although the kinds

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.760
of sentences that the mind is able to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.200
speak makes it seem like it's the other

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.159
way around um we put the body back into

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.640
nature and then I have this kind of like

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.799
uh little organism kind of thing here

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.120
that's hugging or is expressing this

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.480
trust Circle uh which is the center of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.760
the convivial society and the different

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.920
types of care um so kind of external to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.239
that and then we're going to talk about

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.239
lyric culture and I just reason why I

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.120
drew this is because I wanted to uh make

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.560
the distinction between the convivial

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.840
society which are these kinds of actions

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.720
and so social interactions in lyric

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.879
culture so you could have a convivial

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.159
Society inside a Mythic culture uh you

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.200
could have a convivial Society inside a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.640
more

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.720
uh let's say the Quakers which would be

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.760
more of a conservative or fundamental

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.040
culture so um we're now starting to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.519
identify or imagine lyric culture and I

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.920
just wanted to show you that where it

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.359
exists in my mind at least uh it

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.359
certainly there's many ways to uh

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.040
conceptualize this uh but just to map it

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.520
out like that does that make sense like

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.199
how it's different than these and then

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.199
you can to think about it you can do

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.840
something like this

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.919
and here's another person um and they

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.880
meet together in the convivial

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.160
Society through this person's you know

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.199
backwards but he's also been and they

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.360
kind of create

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.240
this where nature and nature meets and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.440
then you can do something like I was

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.800
playing around with like where the

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.600
body because it has access to Nature

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.039
nature and this body has access to

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.880
Nature that they coexpress themselves

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.360
together and then you have um then you

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.160
have like the mind and we'll talk about

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.680
this today it has to talk to other Minds

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.400
uh primarily uh can come up through the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.720
other direction but what we're talking

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.400
about today is primarily culture which

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.120
is kind of exogenous right where Minds

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.000
talk to other Minds through

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.319
artifacts like music and language and um

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.560
ritual and uh conversation and then

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.840
lyric culture is born so there's

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.520
different ways to connect this is more

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.960
in here is more of an actionable kind of

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.199
way to connect the body connects through

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.880
natural systems and then we're going to

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.880
look at culture when we talk about

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.120
culture we're looking at these

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.840
extra mental linguistic symbolic

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.120
representational whether that's music or

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.400
art or uh dance you know when we talk

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.479
about dance a lot of that's down here in

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.960
the body too so um just to understand

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.720
the kind of movement of the different

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.319
territories we're talking about that

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.720
does that make sense um now of course

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.639
chopping It Up This Way makes it look

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.360
like they're compartmentalized but we

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.560
know it isn't uh but just to frame um

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560
the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.360
conversation um around lyric

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.240
culture so you could have convivial

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.720
Societies in different kinds of cultures

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.319
or you could have uh the mergence of

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.479
lyric

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.919
culture does that make sense some sense

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.560
okay just to kind of map out our

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.360
conversations today um so are there any

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.000
comments on um either the move between

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.560
the or any old comments on origins or

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.960
the move between origins of the body and

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.400
um the uh brief post on culture or just

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.440
uh yeah what's been ruminating in your

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.560
minds just get a sense of um what topics

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.360
um we want to go to and then uh we'll

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.479
probably go into a breakout room so

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:28.919
brief brief uh brief uh check-ins in

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.120
terms of of where this uh where you're

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.759
at with what we've been doing and then

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.720
we'll go into breakout

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.599
rooms just a question to start can you

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:44.599
flesh out a bit what you mean by the

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:46.759
word convivial I've heard people Define

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.680
this but I I just want to hear your your

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.720
thoughts yeah um you could I think you I

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.039
sent you the the whole class right

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:01.240
because convivial Society it basically

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.599
is um were you here when we did the

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.000
trust at the center of the four domains

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.759
of care in that social okay it just

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.800
means that the basis of

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.000
society um is trust networks and then

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
there's four domains of care there's

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
non-reciprocal

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.599
care um there's reciprocal care which is

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:26.080
like an economy where there's some kind

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.720
of transaction but reciprocal care is

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.120
also you know you could be running a

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.399
little Ledger I you know like with your

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:36.240
husband counting up who's done more for

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.320
whom and so you would see that that

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.519
reciprocal care is probably not doesn't

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.440
match that domain of relationship this

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.399
is a problem a lot of people have then

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:48.839
you have non-reciprocal care and then

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:51.480
you have uh in the modern world we have

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.680
dis intermediated care which is like a

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.200
platform like Zoom is caring for us

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.360
today but it and we have certain trust

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.200
relationships with it but it's

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.680
completely

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.480
disintermediated and then the fourth

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.440
domain of care is

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.760
mutual deed

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.200
mutuality um which if you have if you

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.600
have non-reciprocal care and you have a

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.320
place then that's called The Commons if

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.240
you have reciprocal

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.160
care and you have a ledger that's called

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.760
an economy if you have disintermediated

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.720
care and a networ that's called a

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.000
platform and then if you have deep

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.560
mutuality and a community that's called

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.240
the congregation so we talked about how

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.040
all those are established in different

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.959
types of trusts and to have a

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.560
functioning Society then you need to

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.279
have an Ecology of those domains of care

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:53.760
and trust and then the convivial Society

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.160
has to do with also with

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.120
limitations and uh it comes from I an

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.120
illage that at a certain

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.760
point Health Care gets gets better and

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.959
better and then at a certain point

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.480
there's an inflection point becomes that

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.680
the medicine makes you sick at a certain

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.720
point the economy makes you happier and

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.320
then there's an inflection point so the

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.279
convivial Society

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:20.120
is not not Crossing that inflection

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.399
point or having to go back if you think

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.279
about it so those are just ways we

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:27.160
talked about it there's a lot of other

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.000
ways to talk about it but that's what

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.959
that Circle in there meant that that

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:36.959
that um those exercises we were

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:39.720
doing so to basically understand that

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.880
it's it all all convivial all healthy

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.639
societies have to be founded on certain

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:48.200
trusts networks and certain domains of

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.360
care versus how a lot of young people

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.240
are trying to create societies based

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.760
upon blockchain and work from a

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.160
disintermediated place as the super

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.600
ordinance structure all the way down

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.800
this would be a critique against against

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.040
that so it's a good question I actually

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.800
have a question for Katie she said that

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.560
she had several mini insights uh reading

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.399
the post and I was very curious about

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.279
what the nature of some of those

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:20.160
insights were because I couldn't for the

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.560
life of me guess I had a feeling you

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.160
might ask me that and in the nature of

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.440
insights uh I can't remember

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.959
them the

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:37.360
fleeting ephemeral nature of insights I

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.600
but I think it was an investigation

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.279
into it was the piece around language

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:48.320
and just the the

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.480
noticing how

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.320
language

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.120
mediates everything

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.040
um meaning

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.160
I mean like I wrote in the response

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.959
um just in noticing how

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.200
I'm

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.839
perpetually re conditioning and

00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:15.519
reconditioning myself thinking and

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.800
language and how that yeah it just

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.720
mediates so much of of my

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.240
experience um that

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.040
was not that I haven't known that but

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.360
there was something in uh the effect of

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.880
of the writing that

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.480
um well like um Jan what's her name you

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.399
know there was a lot of resonance right

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:43.480
so I just from that place of like you

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.120
were saying in the origins the last

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.360
class um it's like I I intuitively know

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.519
what you're speaking even though I might

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:53.680
not

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.320
have um the

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.680
the I haven't been able to speak it that

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.240
way

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.160
does that make sense

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.279
yeah it was resonant with with a hunger

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:18.399
in

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:23.600
me for a more intimate experience with a

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.760
more dis intermediated

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.760
experience

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.079
with with

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:38.480
life with you with

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.360
myself you mean dis intimidated by

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.680
language not because you can't really

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.720
disin mediate yourself right your

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.360
relationships

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.279
with with nature let's say and you can't

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:57.759
get out of it so you can't you can't

00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:02.759
yeah no no you can't get out of it um no

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:03.959
and even

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:06.360
like I I went back and read the comment

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.800
that I made and I was like what a and I

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.639
wrote meta aware I didn't even know what

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:13.440
I meant by that it was just sort of in a

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.240
moment I'm like well that's kind of

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.920
like like we can't separate ourselves

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.880
from nature go beyond nature but um I I

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.600
think when I I mean I was writing kind

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.839
of without thinking much so but I I

00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:30.560
think it

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.680
was

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.759
um do we get to a place where like we

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:38.440
don't need to use the word nature

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.120
anymore like like to um because we have

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.880
renatured ourselves like like the use of

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.000
nature like this is where language is

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.040
suspect already separates us and how

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.120
we I

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.680
use that word does that make sense

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.319
yeah Bonnie when you go ahead h no you

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:56.319
go okay yeah I was just noticing when

00:15:56.319 --> 00:15:59.000
you drew that diagram um the trust

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.759
Network within like between my you know

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.319
when there's separation between my body

00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:07.560
and my mind like how my mind often has a

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.360
ledger with my body um and my body

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.880
sometimes has a ledger with nature and

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.440
so how there's how those trust networks

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.920
work within the Mind Body and and nature

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.560
as well um and and yeah so that's that

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.639
was sort of that's a new thought coming

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:27.160
up or new insight just about um where

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.000
there's a ledger Within within that

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.199
those

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.880
relationships well maybe that has

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.079
something to do with what I'm sitting

00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:47.360
with uh it's more in the world of

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.120
language

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.519
and um you know how the the two

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.480
drawings came

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.319
together

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:03.760
as a natural that's a natural

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.240
experience as two people let's say or as

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.199
a horse in a

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:13.679
person and we use the

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:16.799
language to

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:20.280
communicate and I'm sitting

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.760
with the bit of the

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.319
song after

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:32.160
all after oh this is what we

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.120
have and yes I feel I'm

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.960
pregnant in the popup

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.880
School pregnant I know that language has

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.559
only got us this

00:17:46.559 --> 00:17:50.280
far so it was sweet the way

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.120
you

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.080
defined platform and Commons and

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.360
congregation it was sweet how you define

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.840
those words

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.679
clearly and that's only got us so far

00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:11.360
there's more that in my heart I know is

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.000
available through language and through

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.559
the natural desire to be intimate like

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:20.240
Katie talked

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.159
about I think I'm pretty good with

00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:26.760
skilled with English language and it's

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.320
only gotten me this far

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:34.080
are and I think about my grandchildren

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.400
and where are they going to be with

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.480
language as it is and it

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.520
just it's not

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.840
enough so any that's what's cooking for

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.120
me

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.320
bunnie

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.159
I can um jump in and and Echo some of

00:19:06.159 --> 00:19:10.600
that I think the the thing that

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:15.720
really um lit me up was

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.600
the the the line let's see if I can

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.760
remember it where lyric

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.600
culture promotes

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.280
intimacy um uh where theoretic cult

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.799
culture

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:33.039
promotes and I can't forget what um what

00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:37.520
the rest of that was but it's it's just

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.080
how

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.880
um just how clearly that was articulated

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.880
just

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.400
bringing

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.280
communication

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.480
into into the here and now and naming it

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.320
as something

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.240
that

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.240
um

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.440
is is possible um and

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.440
new thank you

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.159
Samuel promotes

00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:11.440
literacy yeah and literacy can only get

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.080
us so far as David was

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.360
saying your diagram this morning Bonnie

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:33.240
when you brought those two sides

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.520
together brought me back to an

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.799
interaction that I had yesterday with my

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:40.960
husband which is sort of emblematic of

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.000
many many years of

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.919
interactions where you know I'll have a

00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:49.919
concern and

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:53.919
his immediate response is he has to fix

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.679
it and educate me like he has to make me

00:20:56.679 --> 00:21:00.520
literate about this this particular

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.080
concern

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:07.760
so in the I've been doing a a project on

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.360
writing on feedback

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.919
and I came to a place of recognizing

00:21:14.919 --> 00:21:19.279
that a lot of times I mistake feedback

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:21.400
for

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.240
disapproval so I was just sitting with

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.000
and and thinking about feedback like

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.320
it's something that happens when a

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.799
microphone and a speaker are in the

00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:31.679
wrong relationship with each other so

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:36.480
it's sort of like ww okay I'm getting

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.960
feedback I'm digesting it as

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:46.480
disapproval I trust this

00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:52.200
person biomarkers are firing in my

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.640
body okay he went to Home Depot I sat

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.120
with it he came back

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.559
and we moved from literacy and education

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:09.720
to a much deeper sense of

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.679
intimacy just by

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.480
unpacking

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.679
the this place where we both read

00:22:18.679 --> 00:22:22.000
feedback as

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.159
disapproval and

00:22:24.159 --> 00:22:27.240
it's in the language it's in the impulse

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.200
it's in the intent mention it's in all

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.159
of it and underneath it is the place

00:22:33.159 --> 00:22:35.039
where that

00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:38.720
diagram lives in

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.600
relationship

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.400
so I think I know I'm pregnant now it's

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.760
not going to be a surprise but I don't

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.279
know with

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.960
what

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.520
um I'm curious if you

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.679
can like it seems like the word literate

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.360
is holding a lot and if you could kind

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.880
of expand

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.520
on yeah what what all the connotations

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.120
or connections are that you're meaning

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.320
by promoting a culture of

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.840
literacy yeah that's an interesting

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.440
question I mean it would make a great

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.039
breakout question

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.320
um you know like all these words if you

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.480
start to examine them you would actually

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.679
want to reclaim them too because I I'm

00:23:59.679 --> 00:24:04.200
big at on reading and and I like to use

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.919
language that is less symbolic and more

00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:09.159
literal you know like literally the

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:10.880
horse knows what you're doing right it's

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.840
not a metaphor so we can use these we we

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.320
so the the words are I don't think that

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.720
word uh holds up to examination but I

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.240
think the phrase itself the way that if

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:32.039
you think about how much education is

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:35.120
designed in early childhood to promote

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.240
literacy and how important that is for a

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.840
culture

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.200
um it's that activity that we want to

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.320
use as saying oh why don't we promote

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.760
Intimacy in the same way so I wouldn't I

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.600
would I don't think it I don't think the

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.440
word it sounds it sounds in the phrase

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.600
that the word literacy is really bad uh

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.080
but I don't think that holds up to

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.080
examination it's it's how did uh

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.720
different cultures would promote

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.039
intimacy lyric culture would promote

00:25:12.039 --> 00:25:15.320
intimacy the way theoretic culture

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.279
promotes literacy it doesn't mean lyc

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:20.200
culture wouldn't promote literacy but it

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.760
would

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.039
be

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:26.360
uh and I don't want to say obsessed

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.919
because I think I think

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:31.080
uh modern culture gets way obsessed with

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.159
literacy and then goes Way Beyond the

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:36.080
fact that kids learn how to read and

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.799
they they can understand things and

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:41.159
stuff like that but just this notion

00:25:41.159 --> 00:25:44.320
of yeah just just having

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.360
those feeling into what that kind

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.360
of what that kind of culture would be

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.039
like I'm not sure if that's I think

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:55.720
that's a quote from Jan zi I'm not sure

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.360
but even then you can get hung up

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.360
because the word promote is weird do we

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.399
want to promote literacy you know um so

00:26:03.399 --> 00:26:08.880
just so so um just take it for

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.840
um this sense of a culture aligned

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.440
around um a

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.520
skill or a feature or a property of the

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.919
human condition that is so important at

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.600
its core to that fun that culture of

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.120
functioning

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.760
that it plays that that that level of

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.640
importance and for the lyric culture

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.960
there would be this sense of

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.000
intimacy uh lyric philosophy intimacy

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.640
you know I'm I'm playing off of Jan

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.960
Wiki's lyric philosophy and I'm I'm

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.360
saying can we play off of that and

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.600
imagine a lyric

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.600
culture did that make sense it's kind

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.480
yeah it doesn't hold up to like

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.000
real

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.159
strict examination because then you get

00:27:05.159 --> 00:27:09.399
too this is bad and that is

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.720
good and then we don't you know what is

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.760
intimacy this is also an interesting

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.760
question

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.120
um in in it's definitely has a biomarker

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.799
let me say that uh it's not just a

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:30.520
thought or a

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.480
situation

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.279
um and the best way we Define it is when

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.440
something of the other has ingressed

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.640
into you so you are you now identify

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.840
with that so your subjectivity includes

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.320
something of the

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.799
other um and that's the definition of

00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.519
intimacy

00:28:10.039 --> 00:28:12.840
you know it's like when

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.640
you're relationship with your husband is

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.640
volatile or you're mad at your husband

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.919
it's so intimate it's like you're mad at

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:21.960
yourself it's different like if you're

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.559
mad at your neighbor you know what an

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:27.840
idiot blah blah blah but but the the you

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.120
can

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.440
tell the mechanism is different when

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.399
you're intimate with

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:43.120
somebody yeah and I think it informs

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.880
your language to the language that you

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.919
use so then that

00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:49.039
intimacy brings about a different kind

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:52.039
of language um then when you're not

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.919
intimate with something yeah and the

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:55.799
healing process is the same like if

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:59.080
you're really angry at

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.640
yourself and you're bad to

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.600
yourself and you're suffering inside

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.720
your own

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.320
bones there's a sense in which you can't

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.360
get out of your B you know like your

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.039
body aches and you're eating poorly you

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:19.519
can't you can't just step aside and put

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:22.080
this other body on and intimate

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.720
relationships are the same thing they

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.320
have the same entanglement such that

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.039
the healing process or the or the the

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.720
process of setting things right have a

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.519
lot to do with the kinds of inter

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:41.960
subjective in intrasubjective uh

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.200
processes you have to do to

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.399
uh I want to say excoriate but I don't

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:51.240
know what that word means is excoriate

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.200
the right

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.000
word

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.399
um yeah versus is if you're in a

00:29:58.399 --> 00:30:00.399
transactional relationship and

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:02.880
something's broken down or you're

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.200
mad the practices are different because

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.039
that person

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:10.559
or that company or whatever it's not

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:13.159
inside you right in a in a certain

00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:16.159
identification

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.399
way okay let's go into a breakout uh

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:25.159
room for 25

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:30.559
minutes and um the you can talk about

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:34.720
anything as usually is the case

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.039
anyways no matter how hard I try to

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:40.360
control what you're talking

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.000
about you people always get it

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.360
wrong um but to see the conversation

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.480
should you like to attempt to talk about

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.279
it is something that really struck me in

00:30:57.279 --> 00:31:01.720
in uh reading um doing some of my

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.320
reading um of uh door for his first

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.440
name uh so I bought this book for this

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.600
module and 90 and it's a great title

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.600
Landscapes of collectivity and the life

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.360
sciences and most of the book is

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.760
lousy um it's either stuff you already

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.159
know or it's got math in

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:27.840
it um but this little article by this

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.720
guy uh

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:33.320
door when he comes right out and says

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.880
it's not like and I think maybe this is

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.440
what happen to ktie T I'm going to

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.240
project all over experience it's not

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.000
like we didn't know it before but he

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.519
comes right out and says language evolve

00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:45.880
to talk to your

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.120
imagination now I can make a case that

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.080
it does other things but we understand

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.720
what he's but it also does this too and

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.799
so for example when I showed you that

00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:59.320
draw and I talked that I was just my

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.600
imagination talking to your imagination

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.519
we have to run we have to run uh shared

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:09.600
simulations or when um zult asked that

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.440
question about the convivial society

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.000
that was a lot to go through without

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.720
having a conversation and somehow he's

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.720
got this simulation that I'm trying to

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.000
you know and it's this interesting

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.760
nature of

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.840
language that um what I liked about what

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:32.799
he said was often we suspect that

00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.679
language is doing this but then we hedge

00:32:34.679 --> 00:32:37.200
our bets but he comes right out and says

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.639
this is in the human system this is what

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:41.440
language is evolved to do instead of

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.320
taking someone to

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.639
Africa you know if you're an immigrant

00:32:45.639 --> 00:32:49.440
or you're here for a conference they try

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.880
to get your imagination to imagine

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.960
Africa um and then he says

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.080
because um and and then he says and then

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.639
I want you to talk about this and we'll

00:33:03.639 --> 00:33:06.519
come back and maybe expound on it he

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:09.480
says what happens at that point is

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.639
experience doesn't go

00:33:11.639 --> 00:33:14.320
away but the major function of

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.880
experience is experiential trust since I

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:22.039
know you're trying to get me to imagine

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.720
something I'm still experiencing this

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.799
engagement in real time in real life but

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.679
I have to figure out if I trust you or

00:33:32.679 --> 00:33:37.360
not once I understand you're

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.240
just shap trying to shape my

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.440
imagination then and I can't resort to

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.679
going to Africa I mean if I had tried to

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:50.360
resort to um verifying everything that

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.120
people told me and that I got on social

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.960
media I can't do that so what is the

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.240
experience of trust

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.639
in this situation the fact that we are

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:02.080
in this

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.720
situation uh what is the your experience

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.639
of

00:34:06.639 --> 00:34:09.280
trust uh how do

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.159
you how do you yeah how do you how does

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.679
it function in your life how do you have

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:20.079
to come to terms with it in terms of

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:22.079
trusting these

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:24.879
imaginary

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:27.879
uh worlds and

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:30.800
um and and and now let me just bring it

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.079
back to something very simple that we

00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:37.079
said earlier in the

00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:42.280
um period between uh Daoism and in early

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.800
dosm in Chan Buddhism in China and

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.599
confus Confucianism there was a there

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:53.800
was a conversation or debate around uh

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.280
wisdom called sagehood and

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.240
the dais said the the confucious said

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.560
wisdom is like a beautifully designed

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.359
irrigation system because it takes the

00:35:08.359 --> 00:35:12.839
Wild Water and it forms it and shapes it

00:35:12.839 --> 00:35:15.720
for society and the Dost would say are

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.040
you kidding wisdom is the Wild Water and

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.880
it gets polluted by culture and what we

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.040
notice is that it's very important

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.880
which meta they both are just metaphors

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.320
right the whole basis of the argument is

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.160
an appeal to which metaphor are you

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.599
going to

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:41.680
use and so again this shows you it's can

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.160
you IM what do you imagine when you

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.040
imagine the Wild Water do you imagine

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.079
tsunamis and cattle drowning and right

00:35:51.079 --> 00:35:53.119
or do you imagine something else and

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:55.359
when you when someone places in your

00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:59.160
imagination cultivate at

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.520
irrigation what assembles along the

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.319
imagination and so this is the terrain

00:36:05.319 --> 00:36:09.480
of language and metaphor and working

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.440
with each other's to shape each other's

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.960
imagination such that

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.800
something is actually born something

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.640
shared is born and placed in the world

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.280
through real you know real actions the

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.040
way you build your house the way you

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.520
raise your kids blah blah blah okay so

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.880
that's the um prompt and let it take you

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.960
anywhere um and I'm going to give you 25

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.599
minutes

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:43.400
uh and let me see if I can do

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.920
this okay

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.560
create

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.560
options

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.960
25

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.720
and hold

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:07.880
on and enjoy your conversation and enjoy

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.079
your

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.599
company

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.440
hey what do we

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:58.599
got

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.800
so I can I can share

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:40.440
something I I realized in this exercise

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.400
that I

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.319
had one of the reasons why the the our I

00:38:45.319 --> 00:38:46.760
call it homework reading one of the

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.680
reasons why the homework reading kind of

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.319
like shook me is I realized that I I'd

00:38:52.319 --> 00:38:54.880
never really BR brought any conscious

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.800
awareness to the relationship between

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.839
I've thought about it a lot but the

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:01.720
relationship between language and

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.680
intimacy imagination and

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.920
trust and how

00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:13.200
I I live in relationship to the world

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.240
that I take all that that whole elegant

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.640
process I take it for

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.319
granted there just something that is

00:39:23.319 --> 00:39:26.839
seems to be in place in a way that

00:39:26.839 --> 00:39:29.839
allows me to

00:39:29.839 --> 00:39:32.680
navigate the Elegance of

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.280
that in a way

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.160
that never asked me to bring my

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.119
attention to it in this

00:39:42.119 --> 00:39:47.920
way and and when I started to do that I

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.000
I I I think this is just my default and

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.839
so I'm I'm I'm having a I'm not I'm not

00:39:54.839 --> 00:39:57.680
completely trusting it

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.680
but but the default

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.119
says well that's really interesting

00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:05.560
because if that's

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.319
true we can do any thing we want

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:12.920
with those

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.770
structures and if and if that's

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.980
[Music]

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:22.960
true

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.880
there's an opportunity to

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:33.000
embrace the mechanics in such a way to

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.079
where maybe the next World on the edge

00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:43.400
of In Between Worlds has a chance of

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.400
unfolding but that's all that's my

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.960
default move so I don't even know if

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.359
that's where that rests in any of

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.319
this

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.880
yeah this morning um Kevin and I were

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.960
talking about the video Bonnie Bonnie

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.359
put into the article I I confess I

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:23.720
didn't watch it but he was explaining it

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.960
to me or sharing his perspective on it

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.640
about how these worms can change their

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.319
DNA you know and

00:41:32.319 --> 00:41:34.599
um it was just really wonderful to

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:36.440
imagine that being a

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.119
possibility um being able to you know

00:41:40.119 --> 00:41:41.800
whether or not that could happen in the

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.119
future there's something powerful about

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:48.960
um having the desire to imagine that

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.680
like just using um what what it's like

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.800
the merging of what is real which those

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.079
those worms are demonstrating this as

00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:01.000
possible and then

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.440
um I find imagination to be really

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.920
helpful for me in um in creating a

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.880
future in a

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.319
way well I'll just

00:42:24.319 --> 00:42:28.160
um sweetly sh

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.640
back that video indicated

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.920
that the

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:42.480
collective has the potential

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.559
to create random

00:42:46.559 --> 00:42:50.680
action not causal

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.680
action and so what Ry shared I felt like

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.000
he was Santa Claus here in in

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.720
October kind of like a

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.520
gift through his default and through his

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.280
consciousness of the elegant nature of

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.839
how we

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:12.119
just

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:22.599
flow so I don't know if it's if it's

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:24.960
default but it's yearning for me for

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.079
that kind of random

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.599
potential for all of

00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:52.559
us I I don't I hope this follows but

00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:54.440
just thinking about those nors for

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.280
anyone who didn't see the video like a

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.200
pinaria in a barium solution their head

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.280
will

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.559
disintegrate and then they'll grow a new

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:05.319
head and the and the now they're resist

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:07.079
they can live with barium and so they're

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:08.559
they're

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:10.880
adapting my understanding through

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.720
through the gift of life to be able to

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:16.640
give them the ability to survive and

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.079
adapt to this change of situation and I

00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:22.040
woke up this morning like thinking about

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.800
a grief Workshop that I'm trying to put

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.720
together and like understanding like

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.480
this you know you feel like you've lost

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.079
your head in this horrible time but

00:44:29.079 --> 00:44:31.960
you're going to grow another head but

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.200
then after David is like is it useful to

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.480
know that you're going to grow another

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.040
head or is

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:41.040
it is there something in the not knowing

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.200
right was just like and like that maybe

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.319
just knowing that you have the potential

00:44:45.319 --> 00:44:47.480
to grow another head I don't I don't

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.760
know so so anyway I think I'm just

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.680
really like with the trust part

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.160
like the surrender is important to that

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.520
and not knowing there's not certainty I

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.240
don't know I'm just really like

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.559
wondering what what are the what's the

00:45:02.559 --> 00:45:05.839
balance of the ingredients

00:45:14.559 --> 00:45:19.800
there I think think this follows somehow

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:27.559
but I I I I get like how mimetic

00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:30.319
communication then gave rise

00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:34.000
to language to share the

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.640
imaginal but I think then then like

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.839
secondary to that there's the language

00:45:38.839 --> 00:45:41.359
itself there's a specific language

00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.520
English

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:47.960
language versus Hy language Chinese

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.079
pictographs um and that's where some of

00:45:50.079 --> 00:45:51.599
my question is

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:54.440
like if we're growing a new head if we

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.880
know we're growing a new head

00:45:58.319 --> 00:46:00.839
um like how is the English language

00:46:00.839 --> 00:46:02.720
already

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.640
suspect

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.040
um and do we

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:13.920
need lyric culture to break the trance

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.599
of um the

00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:18.720
separative nature I mean that's part of

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.680
what I was exploring after

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:26.400
I read the homework piece was how

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.839
as I think in the English language is it

00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:31.599
separating me from how is it pulling

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:34.760
my body back out of Nature and my mind

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.160
back out of my

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.720
body um and so is the use of

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.920
lyric philosophy is lyric culture yes

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.520
I'm like breaking that trance is that

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.040
why poetry is important like using the

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.240
tool of the master

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.800
to to um Break

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.800
Free

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.160
I would say

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.760
that I don't know if we need but I

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.079
believe it's possible to

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:01.800
to stay intimate or attuned to a life

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.000
force or intimate with something that is

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.640
uh more

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.160
essential for me language is not that

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.760
essential and I don't even know if it's

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.079
not language that it's this one that is

00:48:17.079 --> 00:48:20.000
exploding our

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.960
head so maybe it's not about growing new

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.559
head but peeling more and more layers

00:48:27.559 --> 00:48:29.960
away that

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:33.680
prove that are kind

00:48:34.599 --> 00:48:37.040
of not

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.480
allowing to stay ATT

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:45.880
tuned to do the rest everything to this

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:48.319
what's

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:57.599
essential

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:10.960
riffing off of what you just wrote bunny

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.760
but I imagine if we don't grow back a

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.880
new head we will get much better at

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.640
thinking through our

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.520
bodies

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.119
yeah so I mean there so much here the

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:34.440
also the cool thing about the barium

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.040
experiment is that these worms are not

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.240
exposed to Barium in the wild so what

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:46.200
was it in you know their DNA that they

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.040
they didn't need to have a they did not

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.520
need to have a past record to have a

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.079
novel

00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:55.160
mutation and this is in the concrete uh

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:59.480
physical IAL world so um this gives us

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.760
um you know it's a metaphor but it's

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.440
it's in it's

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.240
inspirational um

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.799
so the move I want to make here I made

00:50:09.799 --> 00:50:12.760
I've made it a lot of times um and I

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:17.440
think it's implicit in what Rey said so

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.280
the nature of culture has something to

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.920
do with this language intimacy

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:27.359
imagination and Trust

00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:33.040
and this is part of life itself um

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.880
especially if you let language mean

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.400
animal language or plant language uh you

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:45.599
can extend these metaphors way down into

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.960
uh the animal and plant kingdom and

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.240
certain microorganisms and stuff like

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.720
the way does the bee trust a certain

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.000
flower or does the flower you know these

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.960
these can these things can be extended

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.240
quantitively uh down into nature and so

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.839
the nature of the way these things work

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:08.880
as Ry was saying

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:13.480
um oh yeah so that's a good point uh

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.240
there's something yeah the other parts

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.359
of their body already knew how to yeah

00:51:18.359 --> 00:51:19.839
that's an I don't thought about that

00:51:19.839 --> 00:51:22.359
anyways moving on so there's something

00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:24.240
about the way these things work

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.720
implicitly that's very healthy as very

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.000
said I didn't I took them for granted

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.920
but I know that they work together we

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.319
don't have to

00:51:32.319 --> 00:51:35.559
problematize that um if I become

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.119
intimate with you and I trust you and we

00:51:38.119 --> 00:51:41.000
share imagination and we use language

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.680
it's also something magical that

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:47.960
happens so the nature are our natural

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.920
state to evolve culture in This Way

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.880
Comes deep from the animal world and

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.079
probably deep still and we can trust

00:51:59.079 --> 00:52:02.520
that but the kind of language that we

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.839
have today and the kinds of

00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:11.599
imaginary uh worlds that we're

00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:14.319
conditioned to are quite

00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:16.599
impoverished and and actually they're

00:52:16.599 --> 00:52:18.280
quite constrained to you know like

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.440
neoliberal capitalism or The Ledger The

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.720
Ledger is always there why is The Ledger

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:28.319
always there um and and so the the

00:52:28.319 --> 00:52:32.280
there's many people who have consciously

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.000
explored the way

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.960
these structures or processes live in

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.920
culture and they've consciously

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.440
exploited

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.960
them they know exactly how to weaponize

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.240
language they know exactly how to keep

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.040
people so isolated that they're starving

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.640
for intimacy they know exactly how to

00:52:55.640 --> 00:53:00.240
inate you with Virtual Worlds uh

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.799
especially when you're young and your

00:53:02.799 --> 00:53:06.079
identity is being uh

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:09.200
developed um if it's different than if

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.839
you're young and you're out in nature

00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:13.040
and you developing your

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.200
identity in a world in which your

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.119
imagination Soares with the real reality

00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:20.839
of Nature and it can go wherever it

00:53:20.839 --> 00:53:25.200
wants versus you're a child and your SC

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.319
going through me heavily mediated

00:53:28.319 --> 00:53:31.440
Virtual Worlds this changes this this is

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.599
a profound impact

00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:36.400
on constraining the identities or the

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.640
kind of subjectivities that you will

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.520
have and then who do you trust you know

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.200
what are what are the ways in which we

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.400
trust so it's not that

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.280
the the

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.640
living system of The Human Condition is

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.240
broken it's actually working it's just

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.799
been

00:53:57.799 --> 00:54:01.119
exploited um in in in in intentional

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:05.200
ways and so one of the I love what Ray

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.880
said once you start to look at it you

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.240
you know it's like you can see what the

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.160
you know if you watch the century of the

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.960
self you can see what the advertisers

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.599
and the propagandists felt like wow we

00:54:17.599 --> 00:54:20.839
can do anything with this beautiful

00:54:20.839 --> 00:54:25.520
system and um you you you see that

00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.480
there's

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.680
there's um potential there now having

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.960
said that we also honor the system we

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.200
want don't want to distort it or control

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.640
it uh outside of its normal healthy

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.160
habit habits we want to

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.240
use you know as I think annia said we

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.319
start with intimacy can I be intimate

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:50.599
with is something essential and then can

00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:53.799
I let the body sing in a new

00:54:53.799 --> 00:54:57.440
vernacular then I can trust I can trust

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.440
what comes out of my own mouth not

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.480
because I've heavily edited it and

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.359
thought about it a lot but because I'm

00:55:04.359 --> 00:55:06.480
doing the work at this deeper intimate

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.839
level so you create this this vernacular

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.200
that comes

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.559
from uh this deep this intimacy with

00:55:15.559 --> 00:55:17.520
nature

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.039
um unfortunately or fortunately I tend

00:55:21.039 --> 00:55:25.079
to agree that we have to recreate the

00:55:25.079 --> 00:55:27.960
intimacy at the level of

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.720
nature because there's not there's not a

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.559
lot of soil in The Human

00:55:33.559 --> 00:55:37.280
Condition uh to depend upon right

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:41.039
now um and gradually we build up some

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:47.799
Top Soil of trust between humans but

00:55:47.799 --> 00:55:52.079
um right now it seems like we have to

00:55:52.079 --> 00:55:56.400
keep Excavating into the deeper

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.559
the deeper deeper layers of soil you

00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:00.319
know where the worms are working their

00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:02.839
casings and stuff we have to be

00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:06.119
wormlike um in that

00:56:06.119 --> 00:56:09.200
way now having said that if we could

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.480
establish connection there than the

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.880
flourishing of the language thing that

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.000
we are uh who knows

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.119
what you know whether it's lyric

00:56:19.119 --> 00:56:21.720
philosophy or lyric culture who knows

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:26.920
what is possible but um

00:56:29.359 --> 00:56:31.799
there's always a kind of

00:56:31.799 --> 00:56:33.319
recursive

00:56:33.319 --> 00:56:36.720
um a recursive process in the vertical

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.680
stack and that

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:42.640
is the higher you want to go the more

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.760
sophisticated The

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.119
Imaginarium the deeper your roots need

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:49.160
to be in order to support that without

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.079
it floating around in IR reality the way

00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:53.880
it

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.520
does

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.400
this is the problem with what we

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.880
criticize other people who have this

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:02.839
notion of the stack and they say

00:57:02.839 --> 00:57:05.200
spirituality is vertical the vertical

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.079
Dimension but they only mean

00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:10.319
up it's like saying the horizontal only

00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:13.520
means left the vertical Dimension means

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.880
up and down and higher and then deep you

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.880
got to dig deeper to go higher you get

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.960
you got to be intimate with deeper level

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.680
layers as young said you have to get

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.359
intimate with deeper layers of the

00:57:24.359 --> 00:57:26.640
psyche until at bottom you just there's

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.240
the world and then you have to be

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.799
intimate with the

00:57:29.799 --> 00:57:35.240
world so this would be also conate with

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.440
lyric philosophy which

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:41.359
is you learn more about the universal

00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:43.319
Reality by becoming more and more

00:57:43.319 --> 00:57:45.480
intimate with the

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.920
particular

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.440
um you learn more and more about

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.359
timelessness by spending all your time

00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:57.520
you know 30 40 years was devoted to to

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:01.839
something you know

00:58:03.839 --> 00:58:07.480
uh this combination of what you reach

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.440
for

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:13.799
higher is always made dependent on

00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:17.359
and possible made possible

00:58:17.359 --> 00:58:21.039
by the deeper

00:58:21.319 --> 00:58:23.640
intimacy does that make sense or that's

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.720
where I go with it

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:52.200
um I don't know if you defined it

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.319
already but for me it seems that the

00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:57.799
definition of language what what does it

00:58:57.799 --> 00:59:01.000
all include or what different kinds of

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.720
languages are they and are we talking

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.880
only about the spoken one and the

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.960
different language because for me

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.599
language

00:59:10.599 --> 00:59:13.839
widely taken there are so there are all

00:59:13.839 --> 00:59:17.200
sorts of communication and cohering and

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.880
synchronizing and exchanging information

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.319
so it's also

00:59:21.319 --> 00:59:24.079
ensembles dancing playing and so on so

00:59:24.079 --> 00:59:26.559
for me it would be question if there's

00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:29.720
something wrong with this hegemonies of

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.880
spoken language or English language or

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:36.640
same as hegemony of sight that we are

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.839
mostly getting Visual and forgetting the

00:59:38.839 --> 00:59:42.160
hapticity and all the other senses that

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.440
maybe it's a question of reopening the

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:47.440
whole variety and the whole spectrum of

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.079
possibilities of

00:59:49.079 --> 00:59:51.960
language and it will naturally turn out

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.880
that they are reconnecting to the nature

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.359
and to the something because it gets

00:59:57.359 --> 01:00:00.200
because you have you can cross check I

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.119
think there is something in this

01:00:02.119 --> 01:00:06.880
narrowness that it's claustrophobic

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.680
or yeah I mean today we're talking

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.880
mostly about like the kind of language

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.720
that talks to each other's

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.720
imagination um and well one could argue

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.000
that all you know all of them do also so

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.960
um um I use that schema the somatic and

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.720
the gestural you know somatic is

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.640
touching and haptic and gestural is

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.440
dancing and

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.359
postures and um we talked about it as

01:00:38.359 --> 01:00:39.720
culture or

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.720
language

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.640
um the L language

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:55.520
is you know and a certain point what

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.559
we're trying to do here

01:00:59.559 --> 01:01:03.480
is make the distinction between the kind

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.200
of communication that happens within me

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.720
as a compound

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.640
individual and then the kind of

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.319
communication that happens between

01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:13.599
compound

01:01:13.599 --> 01:01:15.839
individuals now you could actually say

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:20.400
this is language also but you know we

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.640
cells have their own language um and so

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:27.240
once when we first started this SE this

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.480
fall

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.839
modules uh we started by saying there's

01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:33.760
so many epistemic constraints because I

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.079
can't imagine all the different

01:01:36.079 --> 01:01:37.760
dimensions of communication here and

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.039
then the different dimensions of

01:01:39.039 --> 01:01:40.760
communication here across all those

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760
Stacks you know and then the different

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.799
it's very hard for me to I can feel that

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:48.799
and I can be with the

01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:51.839
complexity but it's very hard to

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:56.920
language it right you you to to model it

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.880
in any kind

01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:04.319
of yeah I need so many space-time

01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:06.720
Dimensions to see all of

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.319
this

01:02:09.319 --> 01:02:11.039
interpenetrating

01:02:11.039 --> 01:02:15.200
um but I would say here with here so far

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.400
we're talking about this thing that D

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.920
said about language speaking to your

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.079
imagination um

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:28.559
but then there's always experiential

01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:30.880
aspect of it so while I'm speaking to

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.720
your

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.839
imagination my gestures and my tone and

01:02:34.839 --> 01:02:38.520
my dancing and my you know my hands are

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.079
dancing there's still this experiential

01:02:42.079 --> 01:02:44.520
element the function of which is to

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.760
build

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.720
trust or because we don't experience

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:52.079
each other just trying to create

01:02:52.079 --> 01:02:54.039
fantasies in each other's heads if that

01:02:54.039 --> 01:02:56.400
was true we'd be talking to a psychotic

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.559
you know psychotics like you know

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:00.359
they're they're aliens you know over

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:02.920
there and you experience as someone's

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.880
just creating a fantasy in your head but

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.200
when we are doing that and we call it

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.720
language that's because these

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.079
extracurricular these

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:17.079
polyphasic communication things are

01:03:17.079 --> 01:03:20.039
happening where it's grounded in trust

01:03:20.039 --> 01:03:22.240
or else we just it'd be so transparent

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:26.520
to us that someone was

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.960
just trying to create some kind of

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.279
psychotic reality and and in fact there

01:03:33.279 --> 01:03:36.520
are some movies what like you can start

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.839
to feel that like it's just trying to

01:03:39.839 --> 01:03:43.400
like you can feel the manipulation in

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.400
it that's just trying to create I mean

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.000
sometimes we think it's funny like if

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.039
it's a horror movie uh sometimes we we

01:03:52.039 --> 01:03:56.440
notice the manipulation in it it

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.000
um

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.720
but um yeah but we call it we call it

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.200
language

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.200
or

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.680
um yeah like that movie Inception that's

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.000
not you know they're just incepting

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.839
things in people's heads

01:04:16.839 --> 01:04:22.200
versus uh trying to build a shared

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.039
Imaginarium that

01:04:25.039 --> 01:04:28.119
based on on

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.160
trust yeah

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.079
Jessica who okay I think Katie was gonna

01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:38.400
go but okay I'll just say my thing um so

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.039
I'm thinking about

01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:44.720
like say an animal that like imitates a

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.240
plant to attract prey like that sort of

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.200
thing like you could imagine like it's

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.440
appealing to the imagination of like

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.319
this that this insect's going to land

01:04:53.319 --> 01:04:55.559
and then it's going to get and so I'm

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:58.160
I'm kind of thinking about those

01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.160
languages and then like deception like

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:02.920
the I guess the role between like the

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.640
relationship between deception trust and

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.520
and intimacy and yeah what you think

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.599
about that yeah that's a quote from dor

01:05:11.599 --> 01:05:14.559
he said you know and when this explosion

01:05:14.559 --> 01:05:17.599
of these kinds of

01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:20.760
metaphorical virtual language capacity

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:23.839
happens deception explodes right the the

01:05:23.839 --> 01:05:26.319
many ways we can deceive each other and

01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:28.520
again I think

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.680
deception is

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.240
um is a kind of deviant and all living

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.799
systems um need a certain percentage of

01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:42.279
deviant in

01:05:42.279 --> 01:05:45.640
them um it's the but there's there's

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.200
like as Ivon ellich would say there's

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.920
limits to how much deviance or deception

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:56.279
that A system can take um um so you know

01:05:56.279 --> 01:06:00.359
when you're when your a child is first

01:06:00.359 --> 01:06:03.039
learns that they can move you from a

01:06:03.039 --> 01:06:05.960
distance um they start enacting all

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.640
these deviant behaviors like they

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.000
pretend they're going to stick their

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.599
finger in the light socket just to make

01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:14.400
sure that they understand cause and

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.160
effect here and stuff and um there's a

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:22.799
certain gr gratuiti that you allow them

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:26.799
um and culture is the same way um uh the

01:06:26.799 --> 01:06:29.400
animals are very clever different

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:33.920
animals not only through evolutionary um

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.039
behaviors but psychologically deceptive

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:41.799
uh things to each other you know if I'm

01:06:41.799 --> 01:06:44.319
not looking my mayor goes into the tack

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:46.240
room and she eats

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.799
grain and when I yell at her she's happy

01:06:48.799 --> 01:06:51.640
just to walk out but she walks out like

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.440
this she won't pretending she's not

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.760
chewing

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.079
and she and then she goes in there she

01:06:58.079 --> 01:07:00.319
CHS the mouthful like it's very

01:07:00.319 --> 01:07:02.799
deceptive I it think is really funny you

01:07:02.799 --> 01:07:05.119
know horses deceive each other about

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:07.240
food all the time because like if you're

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.200
on the in the prairie and you find some

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.880
really good food and you get really

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.680
happy they all come over and eat all of

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.480
it right so they very there's there's

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.079
deception uh the the living world is

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:19.599
littered with

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:22.960
deception but uh living systems can only

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:25.760
take certain percent of decep same with

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.000
psychopathy there's psychopathy in in

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.760
all animal species but culture can only

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.599
take so much of it before it's

01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:36.359
completely destabilized

01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:39.359
so

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.160
um

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.520
yeah but deception is again you know how

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:48.799
do you know if you're being

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:50.599
deceived

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:54.799
or or or not and sometimes it's fun to

01:07:54.799 --> 01:07:59.039
be deceived you know um

01:07:59.039 --> 01:08:02.720
but deception

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:06.359
becomes you know we it it becomes more

01:08:06.359 --> 01:08:08.839
sophisticated and we're kind of experts

01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:09.559
at

01:08:09.559 --> 01:08:14.039
it um you can deceive a dog a lot easier

01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:16.640
than you can deceive a horse because the

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:19.359
dogs will listen to your

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:23.120
words and the horses once there's a if

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.040
there is a

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:27.839
uh disconnect between your words and

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:30.440
your body language the horse will will

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:33.279
believe your body language the dog will

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:36.319
believe you body language but if they're

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.880
used to these cute little words you can

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.279
convince

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:44.080
them so this is another way you can see

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.520
with the the rise

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:50.440
of words and language and the power of

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.480
deception

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.799
um uh

01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:04.560
yeah and wild animals they're they're

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.359
called wild animals because they they're

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:09.799
L you know you can't they don't you

01:09:09.799 --> 01:09:11.880
can't use words even if you if they live

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.920
in your

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:16.560
household um and this is that that post

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.120
I had about the first two chimpanzees

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.040
that learn American Sign Language right

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.880
they could sign

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.600
but they had to be in cages because they

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.839
weren't

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:31.159
trustworthy they would attack their own

01:09:31.159 --> 01:09:33.000
owners

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.920
um that some somehow that that's in

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.839
there too the difference between a

01:09:38.839 --> 01:09:41.920
common family a common culture

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.440
versus language that's based on words

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.560
really words as

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.880
strategies

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.199
um yeah K or result did you want to say

01:09:56.199 --> 01:09:59.080
something yeah well

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.360
well I was thinking

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.800
about just this premise of like language

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.920
is

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.000
communicating like imagination to

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.280
imagination to kind of create an

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.000
imaginary experience it's not

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.520
necessarily connected to the time and

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.440
place um and that seems true to me

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:20.560
especially when we're talking about

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.080
conversation but then I'm also thinking

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.400
about like other ways that language is

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.199
used

01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:28.000
not at least it seems not about creating

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.800
an imaginary experience but about like

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.840
enhancing or pointing out or like making

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.719
Salient something now or like carrying

01:10:37.719 --> 01:10:40.080
someone through an emotional experience

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:44.960
now like like soothing language

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.719
like I don't know someone's having a

01:10:47.719 --> 01:10:49.159
someone just like fell over and is

01:10:49.159 --> 01:10:52.040
injured like you're okay you're okay it

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.199
doesn't seem so imaginary but more like

01:10:55.199 --> 01:10:57.640
like an energetic communication in the

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.840
moment to kind of like carry you through

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.159
like the undulations of your pain like

01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:04.840
very directly in the present or like

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.000
when people are eating food together and

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.480
someone's like like this is like I don't

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.199
know like enhancing or making more

01:11:12.199 --> 01:11:16.320
drawing more attention to like how

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.400
delicious it is or something like that

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.520
and then I I was kind of thinking about

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.560
how like this seems

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.080
like or like very like base things that

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.280
we don't even think of as language like

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.480
animal communication like you hear a

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.679
scary noise and someone goes ah you know

01:11:30.679 --> 01:11:32.560
which kind of just like is another noise

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:34.000
in the environment that like puts

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.719
everyone into a specific State um to

01:11:37.719 --> 01:11:39.199
maybe look around

01:11:39.199 --> 01:11:43.800
for the threat and I don't know I was

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.320
imagining how like our conversational

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.960
language kind of like moved out of that

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:50.880
to be able to or maybe like Drew on

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.120
those things on those associations to be

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.360
able to

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.880
like aoke things that aren't here in the

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.040
time and place but

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:02.880
anyway kind of to what anesa was saying

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:04.520
I'm not sorry I'm not sure if I got if I

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:08.800
pronounced your name right but like

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.400
maybe I don't know a lot of times it

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.040
feels really good um there's a lot of

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.120
like playfulness too I don't know like

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.600
people who are kind of dancing together

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.159
or joking together very much in the

01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:23.040
present about what's around um just like

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.800
coming back to that style of using

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.719
language I'm riffing on this I don't

01:12:28.719 --> 01:12:30.360
know is there anything that you're

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.719
getting what I'm saying yeah no this is

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:34.360
important

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.920
so so um first we point to things right

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.520
that's gestal and then I can say O A now

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.199
I can say rock I don't have to point to

01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:49.440
it and The Rock could be around you know

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.560
around the corner so we move from

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.199
pointing to oral oral communication with

01:12:57.199 --> 01:13:01.840
a sound S stand in for something um we

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.880
move from having to punch someone so I

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.920
need to be in proximity to making a

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.639
threat gesture and over

01:13:09.639 --> 01:13:13.600
time these functions in communication

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.480
cover more space so I can make a threat

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.920
gesture when you're

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.239
behind when I can make a threat sound in

01:13:22.239 --> 01:13:25.639
a gesture from from 40t away but once

01:13:25.639 --> 01:13:28.120
the sound becomes oral

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.920
communication then you could be behind a

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:35.120
tree and I know you're with my wife and

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.880
I can just make a huge noise and disrupt

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.960
you right so over time we our language

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.520
covers more

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.320
space more people so if I can if I make

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.280
a threat gesture to 20 people I don't

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.320
have to punch all 20 people out

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.320
and it it lasts longer so the text of a

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.040
Bible lasts has lasted 10 you know

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.960
12,000 years or whatever I can't

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:09.480
remember um 5,000 years and so you you

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.679
keep increasing the duration of the

01:14:12.679 --> 01:14:15.960
memory you keep externalizing the memory

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.520
from the body to more and more external

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.280
things and you can grow so now we have

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.480
global

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.159
finance that uh coordinates millions of

01:14:29.159 --> 01:14:31.080
people around the world and it's the

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.520
language of the symbol of currency right

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.000
so you have this you have this

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.280
complexification across time of um of

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:47.520
communication so

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.560
um so what you're saying is true like

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:53.320
there's these other forms these more

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.280
concrete forms these more direct forms

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.760
are also a kind of language or certainly

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.600
a kind of communication depending on how

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.360
you want to use those words but I think

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.080
you have to be careful because in in

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.960
many cases what's happening with your

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.280
example of soothing

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:13.199
someone it's actually the words don't

01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:18.040
matter like one time uh Jonathan rouson

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.080
was on Twitter and he said does anybody

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.760
have any strategies for um calming down

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.239
a I think his son was like fouryear old

01:15:27.239 --> 01:15:30.320
on the train or something like that and

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.280
he was obviously on the train having

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.159
problems with his kid like on a long

01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:36.760
ride and people had all these strategies

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.840
and I said I said hum your favorite

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.159
Simon Garfunkle you know uh Simon and

01:15:43.159 --> 01:15:47.520
Garfunkle tune in your head hum it but I

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.920
said but don't hum it to your child just

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.440
hum it to yourself and he's like oh my

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.679
God like it worked

01:15:56.679 --> 01:16:00.639
because it's it it was I he needed to

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:03.120
change his

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.960
body to to calm down the child and if he

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.679
had hummed this you know sweet song to

01:16:08.679 --> 01:16:10.639
the child it would have been more of

01:16:10.639 --> 01:16:14.040
that same thing so a lot of times uh

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.600
when we're soothing people the words

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.400
don't really matter I mean we want to

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:21.520
use nice words but it's whether or not a

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.120
lot of times our words in or or sing

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.239
songing is actually helping us take a

01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:30.000
posture that will calm people

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.159
down and that's the re the real

01:16:33.159 --> 01:16:35.440
communication happening at that

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.320
level um and then you have to be

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.920
careful

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.920
because if your friend comes to you and

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.560
they're having an emotional

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:49.280
meltdown you want your body to soothe

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.920
them but you don't want to perpetuate

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:55.040
the fantasy like everything depends upon

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.679
him and I mean I screwed up and blah

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.600
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:02.480
see that's just that's just fantasy you

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.080
know a lot of times the problem that's

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.480
coming to you at the linguistic level is

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.760
a delusion or a

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.920
distortion or an

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.280
egocentric Obsession or

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.679
something and so now you have to be very

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:20.040
careful because you might be doing the

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.679
right thing with your body but you might

01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:24.000
be aggravating the story that comes

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.920
along with the emotion and that story

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.280
can be

01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:35.679
delusional and not

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.760
helpful so um as in in most people's uh

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.520
meltdowns have a lot of

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.000
delusional story to them which is not

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.400
which is not helpful now you're not

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.239
gonna say hey that's delusional this

01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:56.560
would not work right you need to be do

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.239
the soothing holding being with someone

01:18:01.239 --> 01:18:05.960
without um adding to the delusion and in

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.880
a way you don't want to add energy to

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:11.679
the delusion it'll exhaust itself as as

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:13.560
these things do and then people just end

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.679
up being a you know just crying or

01:18:16.679 --> 01:18:19.400
something and at that stage it's more

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.920
appropriate just to deal with the

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.719
affect in the

01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:28.239
body um

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.560
so

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.320
um we often get hysterical around things

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.560
that are

01:18:42.639 --> 01:18:46.800
not if you can zoom out and see what's

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:50.760
actually happening um it's not worth the

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:51.920
the

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.199
imbalance or the hysteria and then and

01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:58.040
then sometimes something else deeper is

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.679
operating

01:18:59.679 --> 01:19:03.480
but um

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.840
yeah

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.199
and it's always a question of when when

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:34.239
you have or a situation for yourself or

01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:36.120
you're helping a situation it's like

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.040
relative to

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.360
what what's most important to you

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.239
relative to what and again this goes

01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:44.080
back

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.880
into understanding or knowing where you

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.880
want to put your energy and your effort

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.880
in so relative to

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.639
that is it threatening that

01:19:53.639 --> 01:19:56.639
that

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.760
um

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.120
I want to throw out a few Reflections

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.040
um one about the the worm right where to

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.080
me what was it called the starts with

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.520
the N whatever

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.800
um but at the beginning of that video it

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.560
had like the different layers of like

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.239
Society body organ tissue DNA something

01:21:02.239 --> 01:21:04.639
like that

01:21:04.639 --> 01:21:08.360
um and you know it felt like there's

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:10.719
kind of a a communication when when the

01:21:10.719 --> 01:21:11.679
when the

01:21:11.679 --> 01:21:15.239
worm goes from one level like the

01:21:15.239 --> 01:21:17.199
environment the organ disappears and

01:21:17.199 --> 01:21:19.719
then it kind of has this like response

01:21:19.719 --> 01:21:21.199
on a DNA

01:21:21.199 --> 01:21:25.400
level um so there's like communication

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.639
across like the different architecture

01:21:29.639 --> 01:21:31.159
levels

01:21:31.159 --> 01:21:33.880
um and you know that kind of Discovery

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.159
or the the discussion of that kind of

01:21:36.159 --> 01:21:38.760
challenges our assumptions that DNA is

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.199
just kind of like fixed and know the

01:21:41.199 --> 01:21:43.239
Richard dck and selfish whatever just

01:21:43.239 --> 01:21:45.520
influenced we're slaves for our DNA or

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.440
whatever

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.520
um and I thought that was kind of

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.760
interesting like what could Society for

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.440
example kind of communicate to like a

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.560
body right if Society or something is

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.120
falling apart or you know it's in its

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.679
own barium concentrate and losing its

01:22:03.679 --> 01:22:05.880
head could it send these kind of

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.280
messages to

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:12.080
bodies right and like so think think

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.560
back to the the worm

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.960
example um like let's say you're a DNA

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.560
or you're at the level of DNA

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.280
and

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.320
it when it when the worm you get the

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.560
message to be like okay flip these parts

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.199
of the your DNA and then the DNA is like

01:22:31.199 --> 01:22:32.719
wait what the that doesn't make any

01:22:32.719 --> 01:22:34.639
sense

01:22:34.639 --> 01:22:38.560
like if the DNA had this kind

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:42.000
of if if the DNA were like neoliberal

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.440
you know individuals they'd be like wait

01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:47.480
that doesn't make any sense like we're

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.600
getting messages from the from the you

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.159
know like the the the individual DNA

01:22:54.159 --> 01:22:55.400
would be like okay I need to flip to

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:56.600
this base pair and then everyone else

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.920
would be like oh you're schizophrenic

01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.560
like you're hearing messages like no we

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.840
always do things this

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.840
way

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.880
um and it almost like it almost feels

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.760
like within those DNA there's an element

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.560
of like deception being

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.920
communicated it's

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.960
like um okay back to I'm sorry I'm kind

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.159
of jumping around but back to like the

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:19.800
language example it seems like there's

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.360
there's kind of a link between deception

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.679
and Trust

01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:26.520
like like let's say you know you're in

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.760
our early periods of language it's like

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.320
hey let's cut down let's chop down a

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.960
bunch of trees and we're going to put

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:35.239
them together and make a boat out of it

01:23:35.239 --> 01:23:40.120
right and like if if you're trying if

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.960
you're on like a societal level and some

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.000
people don't understand like the vision

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.840
of like what the hell is a boat why like

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.639
why are we going to chop down the tree

01:23:49.639 --> 01:23:51.080
doesn't make any sense you might just

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.719
kind of like have to lie to them to some

01:23:52.719 --> 01:23:54.800
extent be like just chop down the tree

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.360
and and trust me right and then it's

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:58.719
kind of like a magic trick where it's

01:23:58.719 --> 01:24:01.080
like later it's like the boat comes

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.639
together with all the trees and then all

01:24:02.639 --> 01:24:05.800
of a sudden everyone's like oh I see you

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.239
I see what you were getting at that's

01:24:07.239 --> 01:24:09.480
why we chopped on the trees so it's kind

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:12.560
of like deception in a way can lead to

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:17.840
like delayed trust if it follows

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.280
through I think that all made sense

01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.040
but well I would

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.440
say as just as you you told the story

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.840
they trusted you even though they you

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.800
they couldn't under they could not enter

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.520
in your shared

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.920
imagination they looked in they looked

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.480
tried to understand and nothing was

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.600
happening

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:48.760
there um so

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.040
um I wouldn't necessarily qu call that

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:56.040
deception it's based on Social Capital

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.600
you had some trust there um now if you

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.600
had told them uh cut down the trees

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:07.280
because God no because then I'll give

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.040
you like seven acres of land per person

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:14.320
and then you didn't do that uh that's

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.960
deception um because you're

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.800
basically because they don't have

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:20.520
anything in their imagination that's

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.159
motivating them you're you're giving

01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:24.800
them the imagination that they'll have

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.719
seven acres of land when they're done

01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:31.679
and that's and and that I would call

01:25:31.679 --> 01:25:34.159
deception but if you're just realizing

01:25:34.159 --> 01:25:36.560
that they

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.000
don't they can't there's nothing future

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.360
like that's happening in their

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.679
imagination except that they see the

01:25:44.679 --> 01:25:48.199
trees are gone uh then you're just

01:25:48.199 --> 01:25:51.400
trying to rely on trust uh for whatever

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.280
reason you know

01:25:54.639 --> 01:25:57.639
um

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.239
uh but there you know there so there's a

01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:04.199
lot there there's different strategies

01:26:04.199 --> 01:26:09.080
that that you can you can take

01:26:20.199 --> 01:26:23.119
um and then this goes back to the trust

01:26:23.119 --> 01:26:25.080
Styles because like in

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.600
organizations um you don't trust your

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.280
boss who tells you what to do let's say

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.400
your boss is telling you to do something

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.600
you don't you can't and you can't and

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.000
he's like just do it you can't see why

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.679
you think he's crazy uh you don't know

01:26:40.679 --> 01:26:44.320
if he's crazy an idiot or a Visionary

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.560
because nothing's happening in your

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.360
mind um you don't trust him because you

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.840
don't think he's a nice guy but you

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.040
trust based upon these right-hand

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.920
cognitive things he has Authority and

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.320
Status um and that's a trust

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.800
style it's not it's

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.880
not that's that's a very common trust

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.280
style in

01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:24.119
organizations

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.159
that's was just noticing something in me

01:27:36.159 --> 01:27:38.320
about the word deception that I think

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.800
it's cute when the power the person with

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.000
less power deceives like when the kid

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.280
deceives the parent but I find that I'm

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.119
allergic to when the person with more

01:27:49.119 --> 01:27:51.600
power deceives the person with less

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.920
power like

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.920
if it's when the power relationship is

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.080
one way I tell these cute stories about

01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.880
the kid deceiving the parent and then

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.400
when the power relationship is the other

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.280
way I think it's really bad so just

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:08.920
noticing a little bias there on my

01:28:10.239 --> 01:28:13.400
part I was thinking the same thing just

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:16.440
then Bonnie we about power um abuse of

01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.639
power

01:28:18.639 --> 01:28:21.360
and the weaponization you know get we

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.760
can weaponize language but we can

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.800
weaponize trust like I can deceive you

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.360
into trusting me which gives me more

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:31.880
power to ends that aren't in your best

01:28:32.199 --> 01:28:34.560
interest yeah this gets into a whole

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.800
bunch of stuff that it's kind of besides

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.800
the point but I'll just park it here and

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.760
that is

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:48.000
um so in in the modern world um we have

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.960
this Distortion of trust this is what

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.480
you're going to talk about so in

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:55.480
organizations we don't have so much just

01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.800
out andout

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.639
conflict um what we have is called

01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:06.080
leveraged conflict right so not only do

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:08.440
I make you do something but if you don't

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.719
do it I have a punishment on the other

01:29:10.719 --> 01:29:14.639
side so it's not just combat conflict

01:29:14.639 --> 01:29:19.360
there's all these coupling of all these

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.639
other dependencies that are leveraged

01:29:22.639 --> 01:29:25.440
on top of just the conflict either and

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.880
this is probably the most perverse form

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.880
of conflict there is so if you watch

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.560
suits or

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:36.080
billions or House of Cards there's

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.119
constant leveraging of relationship

01:29:39.119 --> 01:29:43.080
leverage conflict is really

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:46.080
um

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:54.000
yeah versus just conflict you know all

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.560
right you go make your thing I'm going

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.280
to make mine let's see who builds the

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:59.880
better thing you know competition or

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:01.119
something

01:30:01.119 --> 01:30:05.719
whereas it's not a leveraged

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.360
conflict okay

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.760
thank you very much we had a good

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.560
conversation we'll be building on this

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.920
somewhat going forward um leave your

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.560
comments in the comment section so in

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.199
the comment to the

01:30:35.199 --> 01:30:41.239
course uh essay Post in the comment

01:30:41.239 --> 01:30:44.360
section I put a link to a PDF which has

01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:46.800
three short essays on what is lyric

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.639
philosophy if you're interested in

01:30:48.639 --> 01:30:50.320
perusing them they're very

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.560
conversational in style

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.880
um not necessarily you don't have to

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.040
have to read them but um you'll find it

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.320
in the comment section it's a Google doc

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:02.400
okay

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:05.320
so enjoy everybody thank you I learned a

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.520
lot

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:10.800
today



## Cohort 2

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.759
hello everyone Hi

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.240
Gio can you hear

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.910
me

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.560
[Music]

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.080
okay where are we at what do we want to

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.840
talk

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.119
about um let's just do some check-ins

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.480
and see what

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.559
is um on your minds this morning and see

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.590
if we can't weave that into um our

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.199
[Music]

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.199
topic do people hear me because I cannot

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.440
hear

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.960
anybody I cannot hear

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.280
people all right GNA see what's the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.000
problem Maybe

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.760
I'll typ

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.200
written Okay who wants to start what's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.600
been on your Collective

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.400
Consciousness I don't know about

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.600
Collective but I've been I've been

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.640
playing with the origins story that I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.720
started last time and I'm it's

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.640
fascinating at least from my

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.280
perspective and it's close to done at

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.560
least it's done as it's going to be at

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.320
this moment moment in time it's funny

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.399
because when I went back and looked at

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.399
some of the other blog posts I've

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.720
written in the past I've been writing

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.360
about this has been progressing quite

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.439
some time it just gets a little bit

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.479
different each time

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.360
but um anyway that's there

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.280
and tomorrow is my nephew's public

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.439
memorial service and my entire extended

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.079
family is coming in my sister's flying

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.320
in my daughter's flying in so it's both

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
recording in progress It's a celebration

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.640
really and you know it's sad but still

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.039
it's going to be nice to have the entire

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.680
extended family and all these other

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.920
people there so that's what's going on

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.440
here I guess I'll go

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.280
um

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.680
um I've been I was over at my mom's like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.400
last week for her birthday

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.599
and last day I was

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.680
there and it was kind of like a tip of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.200
the iceberg kind of thing I don't know

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.239
why this comment really hit me but I was

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.239
telling her like oh apparently like

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.040
there's Sriracha the chilies it's too

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.040
hot so the the chilies are not even

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.400
growing anymore for

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.640
Sriracha um and then she came back

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.800
because I we're I'm from vancou Island

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.440
and you know there's

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440
there's a few wineries down south but

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.799
she was saying oh well that's

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.920
interesting

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.959
um a bunch of us wineries are apparently

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.319
buying land on Vancouver Island because

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.560
they're thinking in the future it'll

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.599
become more like Mediterranean

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.280
climate um and for some reason when she

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.239
said

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.159
that I just felt like my chest like I

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.480
just felt

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.480
the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.879
um yeah just just like huge grief in my

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.400
chest and I still kind of feel it and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.120
that was a few days ago and I

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.879
don't yeah I don't know how to like deal

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.519
with it it's just

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.879
like I don't know it's just there and it

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.040
really feels like something

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.480
like I have a lot of time off right now

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.799
um because work kind of ends for a month

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.000
or three weeks

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.400
and I just I've just been trying to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.079
maybe spend time in nature but it feels

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.400
like one of those things that changes

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.640
you in like a different

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.560
direction

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.879
um

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.120
yeah but yeah just kind of really hit

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.239
home just thinking of planet and

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.479
everything I

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.520
guess I remember and one other thing um

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.320
I think Daniel schenberg I just watched

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.280
a video of him

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.400
and it kind

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.600
coincided nicely I guess because like he

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.680
was saying like many people unless

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.919
you're like a sociopath many people

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.520
maybe suppress feeling this feeling

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.800
because they're scared of just being

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.479
depressed and not you know just being

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.919
depressed but he said like just trust

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.759
that feeling and then you know just keep

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.240
learning and asking how you can help I

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.960
guess that was his kind of message and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.960
that was that was good

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.440
yeah feel like a reorientation period I

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.919
guess well I could say Matthew I'm

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.560
depressed and I don't know how language

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.280
that we have will help us in the world

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.440
we have right

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.960
now

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.000
well how the language that we have have

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.319
now maybe there is a

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.919
language so I'm in I'm in London at the

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.440
moment um and kind of the timing of the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.600
conversations here have kind of been

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.039
weaving

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.360
into some of the

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.759
discussions we've been having

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.240
um we've been trying to clarify this is

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.120
for a grant making organization we we've

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.000
been trying to

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.440
clarify you know what we're trying to do

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.840
um and we had these big buckets we had

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.120
you know education which I still think

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.039
is an important one but anyway education

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.479
economics um advertising all of this and

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.639
we were thinking oh we need

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.400
to have some clarity that some

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.800
constraint

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.479
um certainly some some clarity would be

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.479
useful and maybe some constraint would

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.360
help us with that Clarity and so we've

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.840
been playing around with this notion of

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.680
cultural renewal I mean which also

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.199
sounds quite broad but in specific

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.000
context in the UK culture this would be

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.160
but it's been really useful

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.800
to have the conversations the

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.400
recordings um to kind of

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.400
help put some words David you know I

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.639
mean the words aren't adequate um to a

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.840
kind of clarity of of what we're trying

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.440
to do so cultural

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.520
renewal you know the kind of culture

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.639
that

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.080
allows for a new world to become

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.240
possible and then you know I introduced

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.879
this this you know new idea of lyric

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.599
culture

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:27.160
and I just kind

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.080
of shaped myself into to this kind

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.280
of intimate relation kind of saying I

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.440
was doing it but and for a moment there

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.280
a new world was

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.400
possible

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.800
um we you know we tried to fill it with

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.120
language but

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.440
um another word came up Bic culture I

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.360
don't know so that would be more oral

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.919
more

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.360
um I guess trying to

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.720
describe I I don't know um

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.080
but this idea that we're renewing the

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.120
culture kind of

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.319
from I don't know first principles but

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:14.400
from you know yeah from from first

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.840
principles all the time um and maybe we

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.280
can add it on to stuff that we're

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.280
already doing but

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:25.000
but I don't know cultural

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.800
Renaissance cultural renewal felt felt

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.639
quite nice it felt like what were

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.320
actually doing in the meeting to kind of

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.680
come to um you know some words that

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.479
might describe what what what we were

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:40.760
doing but it was helpful not to talk

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.640
about culture you know as everything but

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.839
culture in a kind of fractal sense you

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:48.600
know or or

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.440
a culture almost like a setting for a

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.760
context you know let you know um so yeah

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.120
I just thought I'd say that just because

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.560
it it kind of fitted quite nicely with

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.160
the conversations that that we're having

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.120
here

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.800
so I have I have been

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.920
reading I'm kind of melancholic for

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.560
reasons obvious and not so obvious

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.720
um so this notion of lyric culture has

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.720
really

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.760
um kind of

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.200
uh become a big thing for me um here is

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.880
this little new little book I bought

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.279
trying to figure out what we're trying

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.959
to get at um and it says this is a quote

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:30.600
from zi when thought who's Aeros is

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.000
Clarity is driven also by profound

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.880
intuitions of

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.519
coherence when it is also an attempt to

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:41.720
arrive at an integrated perception a

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720
picture or understanding of how

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.240
something might affect us as beings with

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.959
bodies and emotions as well as the

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.680
ability to think

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.519
logically and then the essayist goes on

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:57.160
to talk about her and says zi is

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.079
concerned with the irresolvable

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:01.440
attention in the separateness and

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.839
connectedness of things with problems of

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:08.720
clarity rather than certainty or doubt

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.000
with articulation that includes but

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.079
moves Beyond argument and with a

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:16.760
particular radically altered

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.279
relationship to loss which he has called

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.760
the ultimate philosophical

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.360
problem dwelling in its possibility

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.399
rather than securing ourselves from it

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:34.279
so already these themes of loss themes

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:37.519
of loss and a kind of

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:40.880
clarity and a radical

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.279
rethinking here this is a good word for

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:45.920
you a radical rethinking of the

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.519
situation and allow for a Redemptive

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:52.360
mode of knowing called

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.399
lyric Redemptive is an interesting word

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.880
for

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.959
Renewal um

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.639
I got three three books

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:31.279
this week I got that one and then I got

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.760
my dark Mountain project book comes out

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.440
you never read them they're too

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.680
depressing but I support the work this

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.160
one happens to be a

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.680
beautiful beautiful volume I might read

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.279
it it's usually quite you know the dark

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:49.199
Mountain project is quite

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:53.360
um a lot of grieving for existential

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.519
risk in it and then I'd like to read the

00:12:56.519 --> 00:12:59.279
last CH little piece from this book

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.040
verer herzog's new book every man for

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.639
himself and God against

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.360
all

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.120
um there's a lot of interesting things

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.000
happening right now in terms

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.920
of the timing of where we've

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.760
come gotten to this thing of lyric

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.760
culture

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.000
and this this sense that something new

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.199
is possible three people that I haven't

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:35.160
heard from in a long

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.160
time

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.959
uh reached out to me this

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.079
week and there seems to be something

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:48.120
happening

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.000
um threads are kind of being pulled

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.440
together um and not

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.480
because they are people that I find we

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.920
find each other in agreement somehow

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.759
this I don't know if you were watching

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:06.880
schenberg and Nora Bateson at the Navin

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.600
Matthew was that the one yeah you notice

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.880
how he's really gotten so he's quite you

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.040
know he he didn't have a lot of energy

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.759
so he was really kind of depressed or

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:25.399
down uh didn't have the energy to do his

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:28.440
like Mega analysis kind of big picture

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.399
thing

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:34.680
um and there seems to be some

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.680
some

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.240
uh some kind of inflection point

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.260
happening in terms of how people

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.580
[Music]

00:14:47.079 --> 00:14:49.880
are

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.560
um able to withstand let me say the many

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.199
crises that we

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:59.040
face and what do I mean by able to with

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.639
stand not that we're able to let it all

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:04.120
in this is not probably not

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.120
possible

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:10.680
but um you know the pundits are never at

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.440
a loss for words with the Israeli um I

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.040
don't even want to say the Israeli

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.000
Palestinian conflict because it's like

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.519
an Israeli ham Hamas

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:25.959
conflict um but I saw many um attempts

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.399
at speaking about it where people would

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:30.160
just that are loss for words you know

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.079
we're so we're so worded

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:37.279
up with

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:42.160
um we've exhausted our old vocabulary

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.639
and we need a new vernacular and Z wikii

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:48.120
talks about you know she read writes

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.920
this huge book and she's a poet she

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.920
writes writes writes and she says lyric

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.120
art is the fullest expression of The

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.240
Hunger for

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.600
worldless

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.759
we experience the burden of our capacity

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:04.800
for language as

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.160
loss and what we have lost is the

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.160
silence so there's like I don't know

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.600
there's

00:16:16.839 --> 00:16:20.600
these there's these threads coming

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.680
coming together somehow uh in a light

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.759
way you know this is not building a very

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:30.519
strong propositional argument for any

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:36.519
um and I love the way um like Claudia

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:38.759
Matthew I just love the way you're

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:44.079
letting pieces of it uh be

00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:49.839
useful um in in some way or another

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.040
um I you know and I'll read the Herzog

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.360
thing but what I want to First today

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.639
about culture is

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:06.079
um human culture right this is a in

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:07.319
Collective

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.079
Consciousness uh we might say Collective

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.880
Consciousness is all these the sum total

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.120
of human

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:17.120
culture

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.240
um

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.439
but um one could argue as Herzog might

00:17:23.439 --> 00:17:25.039
if you've seen the Cave of Forgotten

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:27.319
Dreams that you know we we often say

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.880
human culture starting

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.799
um in the caves of you know lco and you

00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:36.120
know when people started creating images

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120
of

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.080
themselves and um so we looked in the

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.360
course content of course animals have

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.640
mimesis right

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.799
so you eat the same Foods you have the

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.240
same kind of behavioral patterns you

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.480
mimic your parents this all creates a

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.679
cultural context such that when

00:17:56.679 --> 00:17:59.559
populations are dividing by let's say a

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.400
tsunami or something and that you get

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.440
cultural drift and even though they

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.320
technically could still uh breed their

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.240
their mating behaviors have changed

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.240
slowly through cultural drift and then

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.000
with animals a lot of times uh that's

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.960
enough to create a barrier so that they

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.520
that then they don't breed and then the

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.480
genetic uh populations change so there

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.000
is there is the notion of culture in the

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.880
animal Kingdom but we're talking about

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.159
human culture and we might say that

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:37.880
human culture

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.880
begins in song that would be lyric

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.000
culture um and painting some type

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.799
of

00:18:48.799 --> 00:18:53.600
um something a little more than

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:59.120
M bi physical mimetics okay okay

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.280
something more than monkey see monkey do

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.400
I mean we incorporate that in ritual and

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.000
stuff but um there's a sense in which

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.120
when you're painting on the walls of let

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.760
go uh you're creating an Imaginarium

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.039
they're creating an imaginary

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:22.840
world um and in many cases these

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.120
imaginary worlds are privileged to the

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.720
few right because either not everybody

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.919
visits your cave or they don't

00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.400
understand your own images you don't

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.600
have the same Mythos etc etc etc and so

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.799
we talked yesterday

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:40.000
about language and culture culture

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.600
emerging from the fact that with human

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.200
language um in many cases we are it's

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.919
used to speak to another person's

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:53.799
imagination I mean we have a lot of

00:19:53.799 --> 00:19:56.880
other languages like you know get get

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.400
the pen it and then you have to look

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.039
around for the pen I'm not talking about

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:04.280
an imaginary pen but this uniquely

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.280
human uh

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.320
explosion of

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.400
um and of course that's what we do here

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.200
in the popup school right we're all

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.600
sitting here creating

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.200
worlds that we're sharing it's hard to

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.600
share because the language the meaning

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.240
of the word slide and this and that

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.159
um but we're also trying to

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.039
honor our lived experience and

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:35.320
intuitions we go out in the everyday

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.000
world and we bring those experiences

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.400
back in here so um so Herzog in this

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.200
last passage of this crazy book of

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.360
course he writes a book that's quite

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.120
crazy um this his

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.840
autobiography

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.320
um he he he imagines he's trying trying

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.919
to imagine the world without books

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:02.200
that's how he

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.400
starts and then he starts to imagine the

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.679
world without images like he starts to

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:15.120
subtract Take It All Away in his

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.720
imagination and so he writes for decades

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.240
now people have stopped reading even

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.799
University students no longer

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:26.919
read this development is the result of

00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:30.320
tweets and texts in short videos what

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.400
will a world be like with hardly any

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.480
spoken languages which are becoming

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.159
extinct in their profusion in

00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:39.480
variety what will a world be like

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.440
without a profound language of pictures

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.840
where my profession no longer

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.080
exists the end is

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.080
coming he doesn't he doesn't say this

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.080
but I think it's the same thing with AI

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.679
and Dolly the images becoming so

00:21:58.679 --> 00:22:00.440
many that that something's getting

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.760
exhausted out of out of culture I

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.440
think I picture a radical turning away

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.440
from thought argument and image not just

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.600
an approaching darkness in which certain

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.240
objects can still be felt but a

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.080
condition where they no longer exist at

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.080
all are Darkness filled with fear with

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.840
imaginary

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.400
monsters I think of a passage in the

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.320
Florentine codex W written as though

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.760
speakers amid the destruction of their

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.480
culture and Horizons were still trying

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.880
to find their way to their

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.080
language a cave is terrifying a place of

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.799
Terror a place of death it will be

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.720
called a place of death because people

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.440
will die here it is a place of darkness

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.080
dark always dark it stands there with

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.520
mouth gaping open how could one depict

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.679
the absence of

00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:59.080
images not just their removal

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.720
the final irrevocable turning away from

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.120
images but their

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.840
non-existence I imagine two mirrors set

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.440
up an exact opposite reflecting nothing

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.200
but each other into Infinity but with

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.080
nothing for them to

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.880
mirror then he goes on and on and on and

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.799
then he ends

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.600
with

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.679
no truth no lie no river called the

00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:35.400
river of lives the deceiving river that

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.640
pretends to be the much larger River no

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.679
Japanese marriage agency ordering a

00:23:40.679 --> 00:23:42.600
bucket full of sand to be emptied out of

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.679
a satellite so the bride can be

00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:47.320
astonished by a shower of meteorites no

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.440
more twins living in separate bodies but

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.720
thinking and speaking in unison no parot

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.240
parrots from Alexander Von humble's 1802

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.760
Journey up to oronoko where he came to a

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.039
village all of whose inhabitants had

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:03.559
been killed off by a plague their

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:06.240
language had died with them but the

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.400
neighboring Village had for the past 40

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.360
years continued to look after their

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.240
parrot this parrot still spoke 60

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.200
distinct words of the inhabitants of a

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.559
dead Village their dead language humbal

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:22.200
copied them down in his notebook what if

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.159
we taught those words to two parrots and

00:24:24.159 --> 00:24:26.440
the two could Converse in them what if

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.399
we project ourselves far to the Future

00:24:28.399 --> 00:24:30.640
and imagine things that we've created

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.559
that still exist not forever but for

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:36.440
200,000 years let's say a time when

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.399
Humanity will almost certainly have died

00:24:38.399 --> 00:24:41.159
out but certain of our own monuments

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:42.960
might still exist

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.320
indestructible the dam in the vajon

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.880
gorge that with stod the vast Landslide

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.760
of 250 million cubic meters of rocks in

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.039
Earth and gravel at its foot the dam is

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:56.159
28 meters thick and poured from

00:24:56.159 --> 00:24:58.520
specially hardened concrete

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.720
this lower part would almost certainly

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.240
still be there standing majestically

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.000
without relaying any message no message

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.760
for

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.159
anyone there at the foot of the smooth

00:25:09.159 --> 00:25:11.360
concrete wall there would be a crystal

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.520
clear trickle of water from the rocks to

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.039
the side it would be sought out by herds

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:17.880
of deer as

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.559
though and then it just

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.200
stops and there's something in that

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.320
performance which speaks

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:35.399
to uh what lasts and what's what's

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:40.760
lost and that something like a lyric

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.960
culture is not something that imagines

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.399
itself to be

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:52.200
Everlasting and so there wouldn't be

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200
this

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.679
obsessive pursuit of

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:08.760
of of culture you know of everlasting

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.640
culture and then just to my check-in is

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.399
kind of long but um I'm I was

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.240
writing some notes on a conversation I'm

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.960
gonna have with

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.799
someone and I was thinking about like

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:29.640
we're in the middle of this the six Math

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.159
mass

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:35.159
extinction and

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:38.240
um and instead of looking at

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.679
that as a problem to be solved yes we

00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:45.120
are complicit but we're also entangled

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.360
in it right we're entangled in the

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.320
violence of the world uh we suffer our

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.640
own

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.640
actions

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.520
and what if what if we faced it with a

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.200
certain kind of clarity and the clarity

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.159
was is

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.039
that

00:27:07.039 --> 00:27:10.080
um in order for things to

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.039
advance some things have to be taken out

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:16.679
of existence that's called

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.480
Extinction

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.360
and reading the end of his book was

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.159
something like that you know it was like

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:27.799
and the and then the whole ending is

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:30.080
just taken out of existence to perform

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.640
what he was talking

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.039
about

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:38.159
um anyways those are my

00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:42.159
Reflections um and the final reflection

00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:44.279
which I guess is probably on everybody's

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:48.799
mind maybe not is the notion

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:53.120
of culture as culture class you know

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.960
basically um every culture within its

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.760
own Contex context is a whole as a

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.120
Gestalt um but

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:08.120
then it's very very difficult for

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.440
cultures to

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.440
overlap uh certainly in time certainly

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.799
in

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:17.200
territory um in

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.200
power

00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:26.279
um they seem to

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.919
be

00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:30.960
wrapped in very hard

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.679
shells and when you're on the inside

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:40.440
that's that's a safe container right

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.080
um but there there's these propulsion

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.640
forces or

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.360
something just trying to look at what is

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.000
and has been the

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.399
case

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.360
so the story of human culture uh begins

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.080
with human culture begins with an image

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.080
and a story of one's

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.279
culture

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:18.840
um so it's both inclusive and and

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.320
exclusive

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:50.960
you said something there about being

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.840
exhausted exhaust or culture exhausting

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.840
itself there's

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.240
something I was there's a Israel rally

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.840
downtown I walked by it and I heard the

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.799
guy speaking on a loudspeaker

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:09.919
and you know I guess he was I caught the

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:13.559
end of his speech and it was kind of

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:17.279
the the feeling was sort of whe there he

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:19.600
said something about

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.039
like he was talking about another rally

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:24.080
that was like Pro Hamas or something and

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.919
he was like oh they covered their faces

00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:28.799
but we don't you know or whatever so

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:31.000
don't cover your faces you don't

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.640
whatever and just the feeling of that

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.559
was

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:40.159
like I felt exhausted about that it felt

00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:43.519
like very like combative and very Rah R

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:47.320
raah and it was like H this again it was

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.480
like I I was thinking about it I was

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.240
like I'm kind of bored of that like it

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.919
just seems boring and that seemed to be

00:30:56.919 --> 00:31:00.039
that kind kind of attitude seemed I felt

00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:01.600
exhausted

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.120
by yeah illich called that kind of

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.799
speech viot types he says that you use a

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:12.200
certain word and an image comes with it

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:16.440
and then it controls the speech for all

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.399
time you know like like the image of the

00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:23.919
Palestinian woman with the you know head

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:29.000
scarf or the image of the white man you

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.960
know or there so there's these little

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.960
cues that enter into the speech that

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.279
lock

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:40.679
down the possibility for conversation

00:31:40.679 --> 00:31:44.440
right so

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.600
um and

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.159
that and that that that's you know what

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:59.519
simulated speech or it's yeah it LO KN

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.559
down it isolates the conversation into

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:10.880
one meme let's say or one

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.360
mode um and rallies

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.960
are famous for that because they're a

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.360
rally you know like 2

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.200
468 who do you want to eliminate or

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:28.639
whatever you know like they they

00:32:28.639 --> 00:32:32.320
their currency is in that kind

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.840
of Rabel

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.720
rousing Bonnie

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.880
for me there's something juicy

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.880
in and I'd love to see those in writing

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.840
again so that I could really digest them

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.120
the zi quote and the essayists response

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.880
to that quote and I'm putting that on

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.440
top of what you said about

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.840
um the elimination of a a particular

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.960
species in order to move forward and

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.080
progress the

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.960
Epic

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.880
Dynamic and what's juicy for

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.559
me is this notion of rethinking

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:45.279
loss that was mentioned by zi in that

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:49.639
quote and it's juicy for me here if

00:33:49.639 --> 00:33:54.799
we're still trying to find a way to take

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:58.600
our thinking and put it in our body

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.760
I have lived a long life and experienced

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.679
a lot of loss and I think I know about

00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:11.760
loss but rethinking in in my

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.960
body that's something I'm not quite sure

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:21.839
about yeah that's what I'm saying it's

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:25.879
it's I'm not sure we can ever

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.440
really

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.800
experience all of it and of course

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.200
um we're not meant to be be in despair

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.359
either this

00:34:38.359 --> 00:34:43.159
is you know we we have these

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:46.639
as you know Jonathan rouson substack

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.320
article uh title joyous

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.760
struggle uh every man for himself and

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.520
got against all or something no it's

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.720
like um but

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.300
the magnitude of

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.359
[Music]

00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:06.359
loss

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.480
um there's two sides to it the magnitude

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.520
of loss it has the magnitude it has

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.240
because we live our lives as if it's not

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.320
a first principle of reality right um I

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.119
mean we we know that everything is in

00:35:28.119 --> 00:35:31.200
passing the season's pass your parents

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.520
pass you're passing cultures p and we

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.119
know this but we don't live as if that's

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:44.760
true um and

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.560
um there's also you know I'm we'll talk

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.480
about this a little if you come to the

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.560
tempor um perspective

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.560
or just watch the video

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.240
um

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.160
because

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.440
um I don't know everything we've been

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.160
talking about all year I'm I'm starting

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.440
to sound like Matthew because it's all

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.480
just oh

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.440
geeez well that was weird you know what

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.800
an ice cream pain in your head feels

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.880
like I just got

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.640
one too much static electricity in my

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.599
brain but it's like you know what you're

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.800
talking about pure abstractions they're

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.440
there and not there at the same

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.119
time well I had Layman Pascal and Tom

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:36.000
Murray were over here a couple weekends

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.400
ago and we were talking about that

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.040
phrase and then all of a sudden it did I

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.839
say this last time anyways it hit me

00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:46.760
that

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.240
like everything is there and not there

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.960
at the same time like the mountain

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.760
eventually won't be there and there was

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.480
a time when the mountain wasn't there

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.599
it's just that it happens so

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:00.440
slowly we don't experience its loss

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.960
unless you know they come and the Mone

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.000
company comes and takes it down or

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
something and I was playing around with

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.760
being in

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.480
this attitude

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.680
of seeing everything as being here and

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.480
not here at the same time and it made

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.200
everything seem much more precious you

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.000
know like like

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.000
uh that things are going to be taken out

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.280
of

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.079
existence I don't know what I'm saying

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:46.680
but this temp

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:51.880
this law should not be

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.800
surprising and

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.160
yet even if it's not surprising it it

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.680
comes with the same biomarker as we said

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.280
you know I mean the capacity to and I

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.359
and that's the question that you you'll

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:06.839
get a lot of her quotes because I'm

00:38:06.839 --> 00:38:10.960
writing a series on lyric culture um but

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.000
that's the that's the problem like it's

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.560
to be able to it's a philosophical

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.880
problem of loss and having Clarity

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.520
around that and

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.119
also

00:38:23.119 --> 00:38:26.079
simultaneously being intimate seeing

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:28.079
things perfectly being intimate and

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:33.040
loving them and

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.000
um those two

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.640
things are very hard to do

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.640
together

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:55.200
um so you know in many cases I think we

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.480
turn to

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.319
despising despising things that we

00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:05.599
actually deep down

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.680
love I listened

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.760
to your first cohort and I felt like it

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.359
was was really moving

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:42.760
and um I forget who was

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.880
saying um how this word

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.280
nature is

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.440
just something that perpetuates the

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.119
separation

00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:00.560
as if anything on this planet that I

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.800
know

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.359
of is of this

00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:07.000
planet

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.440
okay and

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:17.560
um I was doing some reading on the PDFs

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.560
that you

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.160
shared and I just did

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.079
this thing because you know at some

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:32.040
point there's a quote from herac

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.800
heraclitus that says the fairest order

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.240
in the world is a heap of random

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.560
sweeping and

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.480
uh that sort of gave me

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.400
permission and by the way I think

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.880
there's so much about this sort of perm

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.240
missionary movement that we need to

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.400
sort

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.720
of think especially

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.240
intergenerationally at this

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.680
time and

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.440
um I I just kind of put all these things

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.880
in a Google

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.200
doc um as I was reading and then

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.440
throwing other things in the middle I

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.079
mean the random sweep uh you

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:27.800
know and uh I don't know

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.599
if sui said

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:35.160
this or it was said about

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.640
lyric philosophy but to appreciate how

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.240
our understanding can be limited by fear

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.960
by a will to Mastery by a need to

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.640
control is to begin the learning and

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.920
learning that constitutes the practice

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.520
of lyric

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:57.319
philosophy what's expressed by the

00:41:57.319 --> 00:42:00.240
purposive arrangement of possibilities

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.480
of resonance the purposive arrangement

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.280
of possibilities of res

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.920
resonance is a lyric

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.720
thought supposed to know is more like to

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.640
visit or cohabit than to

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.200
own and then there was this thing about

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.200
her metaphors being poly

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.480
dimensionality integrity and resonance

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.040
here comes the resonance

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:40.280
again just as an ecologist attends to

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.160
the millions of organisms microorganisms

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.000
and nonorganic

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.800
beings and processes that make the beach

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.800
the living entity that it is so the

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.200
serious reader of integrated thought

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.680
must pay attention to the micro

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.839
components that produce that thought

00:43:01.839 --> 00:43:03.559
stability and

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:06.640
integrity irrespective of the amount of

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.520
study which it may itself require we

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.440
must not lose sight of the fact that

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.079
it's only a part of the whole and if as

00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:21.200
the number of Dimensions grows we find

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.520
increasing difficulty in comprehending

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.839
all the different parts of the structure

00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:30.400
at the same time and we must exercise

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.119
great

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:35.839
patience lyric meaning resists summary

00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:39.680
and paraphrase as much as it resists

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.200
analysis the method is not expository

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.200
but

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.839
inactive the essential tension between

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:51.599
lyric desire and the capacity for

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:53.800
technology I thought this was an

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.640
interesting thing to put Side by side

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.640
because I sort of I'm sort of feeling it

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.280
in the way I engage in

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.599
these gatherings these these

00:44:06.599 --> 00:44:08.880
bioluminescent Gatherings that's kind of

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.720
what I'm calling it even though I'm in

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.960
the dark but see that makes a difference

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.040
um and then the ability to find things

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.079
to

00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:21.839
forage you know there's something

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:24.359
perhaps about this

00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:26.880
lyric um

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:30.400
culture that's

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.480
especially uh

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.359
um

00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:38.079
um

00:44:38.079 --> 00:44:43.240
um good at at meeting not matching but

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.839
meeting our

00:44:45.839 --> 00:44:50.760
our our experience this hybrid

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:54.319
experience which we're doing all the

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.720
time I mean we

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.160
our all our

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.359
devices and

00:45:01.359 --> 00:45:06.640
then I'm going to post it this quote

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.440
from Audrey

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.559
Lord came to mind as

00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:21.599
somehow enacting

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:26.480
that for there are no new ideas they

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:30.079
only new ways of making them felt of

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:33.319
examining what those ideas feel like

00:45:33.319 --> 00:45:36.720
being lived on Sunday morning at 7 a.m.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.280
after brunch during wild love making War

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.079
giving birth mourning our dead while we

00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:47.079
suffer the old

00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:48.680
longings

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.920
battle the old warnings and fears of

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.599
being silent and impotent and alone and

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:04.240
while we taste new possibilities and

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.040
strengths

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.800
yeah

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.920
I love this word resonance

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.839
Melina that really resonates with me and

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:08.800
the word the dimension or the

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.160
multi-dimensionality and I see this up

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.800
and down and what Bonnie started with is

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.599
this up and down and and this this

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:20.839
movement of the grounding and like the

00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:22.960
boots in the ground boots in the mud and

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.319
step by step and then all of a sudden it

00:47:25.319 --> 00:47:27.200
all opens up in a

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.839
way and I feel I think Ry was talking

00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:33.800
about um the language the intimacy and

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.720
the trust and for me there's also like a

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:39.000
joy and an innocence that comes with

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.079
that and I think that's what Justin

00:47:41.079 --> 00:47:43.920
talked about innocence a lot and I feel

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.400
this innocence is also like a

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.920
willingness to see the world as it is in

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:52.280
this moment with us as bodies in

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.000
space and it's like an openness that

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.559
comes

00:47:57.559 --> 00:48:02.079
with with a willingness to see and and

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:05.640
therefore a reality is being created in

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.480
this moment not based on what it was or

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.599
how it will be but from this place

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:16.720
of yeah this place

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.280
of

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.839
relationship and Bonnie talked about

00:48:20.839 --> 00:48:23.559
soil and and when I think of the quality

00:48:23.559 --> 00:48:25.839
of the soil I feel what is the quality

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:27.839
of the

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:31.000
relationships how are we relating to

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.599
what is in this moment and can I can we

00:48:35.599 --> 00:48:37.880
hold more of it in this

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.400
multi-dimensional field and there's this

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.040
resonance and there these are those in

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.680
every dimension of it there are some

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:48.640
attractor fields that are calling and

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.960
can I be in relationship with that even

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.720
though it feels unnatural and it's and

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.799
this is almost like the Attunement of

00:48:56.799 --> 00:48:59.359
the body to the attractor field in that

00:48:59.359 --> 00:49:02.079
Dimension and all of a sudden it's like

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:04.559
this clicking in place and I can see or

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:07.559
I can feel I can be it and there's that

00:49:07.559 --> 00:49:10.119
new relationship that emerges from the

00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:12.400
edges

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.359
and I'm thinking of this project that's

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:16.839
actually being launched here in New

00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:19.760
Zealand about the the seeds I think it's

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.640
the Bill and Melinda Gates Association

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.920
who are doing something with rice seeds

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.599
and manipul and bringing it back into

00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:29.839
India

00:49:29.839 --> 00:49:34.720
and my whole being it it just hurts it's

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.559
like ah I'm I'm I wanna I just W to do

00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:42.160
something but I don't know what to do

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.280
because it's not my thing and it is my

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.000
thing so that's the Duality or the

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.559
Paradox of it it's like there's the

00:49:49.559 --> 00:49:52.200
stream of the ocean but there's the

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.760
undercurrent and I want to be part of

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.079
both I am both but I feel there has to

00:49:58.079 --> 00:50:00.880
be like a an

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:03.359
attention to the undercurrent so there

00:50:03.359 --> 00:50:05.680
is a balancing out of it because some

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.880
things are just I can see for the

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.280
generations to come that that is not the

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.160
right thing to do because my whole body

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.440
is screaming it like leave the seeds put

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.160
the focus on the soil right that's where

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.680
we all start we start with the

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.680
relationships and the soil and and the

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.720
innocence and the joy and and and just

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.200
whatever if we might not be here in 100

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.640
or 200 years then you

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.680
know the sadness comes from the past it

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.440
does not come from the future it's the

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.760
same like wisdom you can always say

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.079
things about wisdom after you spoke not

00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:48.400
about you cannot say oh this person is

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.480
wise In This Moment without actually

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.440
hearing what he or she has to say it's

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.400
always afterwards that you say oh that

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.160
was wise or it's the same with this

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.400
intergenerational creating of whatever

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:06.799
is emerging from us and I don't

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:27.359
know

00:51:44.119 --> 00:51:45.760
yeah I've been sitting a lot with the

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.359
question of

00:51:47.359 --> 00:51:50.799
violence um and kind of this conflict

00:51:50.799 --> 00:51:54.240
happening and my moves are usually like

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.599
where does this conflict exist inside of

00:51:56.599 --> 00:51:59.839
me and then also looking at

00:51:59.839 --> 00:52:03.160
um times I've had like close contact in

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.760
in the natural world um thinking about

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.720
floods and lightning storms

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.960
and this kind of ability for rate of

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.760
change like floods and and wildfires

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.839
that just raise everything and the Deep

00:52:20.839 --> 00:52:23.079
loss of that but then also the

00:52:23.079 --> 00:52:27.160
possibility that that affords and re

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.000
reflecting on like near-death

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.559
experiences and and being really

00:52:32.559 --> 00:52:34.559
intimate or really close to

00:52:34.559 --> 00:52:37.240
Nature's intense powerful

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.760
forces um and those beings some of the

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.760
scariest moments of my life but

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.119
also um so there was like a loss of

00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:49.280
Safety and Security um but then what was

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.760
gained from that was like such a deep

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:55.599
deep humility and respect and awe um for

00:52:55.599 --> 00:52:57.119
these powers and this recognition that

00:52:57.119 --> 00:52:58.760
actually that is

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.359
me massive lightning storms and and

00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:03.640
being kind of in the midst of it and

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.319
like the awe the terror and going oh my

00:53:06.319 --> 00:53:08.680
God that's me and holy like I'm so

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.280
small like I could be wiped out like

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.200
that um and that being a really really

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.079
important thing to feel in my body and

00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:19.079
to experience so kind of going back to

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:24.720
this um notion of loss and gain um is

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.119
that really you know how does that

00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:28.520
really work everything kind of gives and

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.000
takes um from each other and then and

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.599
then sitting more with this inquiry

00:53:32.599 --> 00:53:35.400
about um what what's the right kind of

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.839
violence like where does violence fit

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:40.000
into our culture and and how do we work

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.839
with that in a productive

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:48.079
way yeah and you know it just I occurred

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.799
to me that and I have been writing about

00:53:50.799 --> 00:53:53.000
it already that well you were going into

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.160
this notion of the moral animal

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.200
and you know if you think of the

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.160
discourse around the Israeli

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.160
Hamas

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.680
conflict what what would I what term

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.599
would I use if I didn't want to use the

00:54:13.599 --> 00:54:16.359
term of the Israeli people I don't

00:54:16.359 --> 00:54:18.200
know

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.000
um you know they're they're they're so

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.880
entangled you know we've been trying to

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.720
last module we tried to write an origin

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.720
story like what and then you could say

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:28.839
where where did the origin of the war

00:54:28.839 --> 00:54:32.040
begin it it has no beginning I mean you

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.119
have all

00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:36.920
these conflicting stories and you know

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.319
the British were there after World War

00:54:39.319 --> 00:54:42.760
II and then they they fought a war

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.720
against the British and I heard someone

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.559
say the other day Germany wanted to make

00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:51.040
you know reparations so they found

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:53.599
Israel a nice little place to live like

00:54:53.599 --> 00:54:56.400
you know like and then you get these

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.720
stories and I was Googling like where do

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.839
the where do the Palestinian people come

00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:02.440
from well they don't come from any they

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.040
come from Africa or something like you

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.359
know what I'm saying it's like at a

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:07.839
certain point all these cultural stories

00:55:07.839 --> 00:55:12.359
they pick a spot to say this is the

00:55:12.359 --> 00:55:17.640
story you know and um and we notice that

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.359
this is the this is a problem with

00:55:20.359 --> 00:55:23.280
origins in origin stories in

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:27.880
general epistemic con straints um but

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:31.160
you know we can so but what what happens

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.760
also in these these conversations if you

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.880
can you listen to it it's very obvious

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.839
what I'm going to say but it's like

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:42.599
there's there's everything is Quantified

00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:45.640
like equal response like you killed this

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.000
number of people what's an equal

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
response or like the the Ledger

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.960
you know it's like who owes you know we

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.920
talked about this and and because I

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.079
don't I don't want to make this a a

00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:01.160
specifically um complaint about uh the

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.640
Jewish religion because we talked about

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.920
it in the Catholic religion like

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:08.160
you born and you owe a debt like this

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.400
this Ledger thing that permeates

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.799
our moral and ethical

00:56:13.799 --> 00:56:17.400
conversations is so antithetical to

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.200
relationship right and um

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:27.480
and the the the are cultures that are

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.359
so entangled you could never tease you

00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:33.880
could never tease them apart any again

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.400
you know and that doesn't mean they're

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.200
so entangled they're beautiful they're

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:40.359
so entangled it's it's it's a tragedy

00:56:40.359 --> 00:56:42.200
you know it's like a

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.720
Shakespearean play where

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.319
where every movement of my right arm is

00:56:49.319 --> 00:56:52.520
going to be it's going to move my left

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.880
arm and and

00:57:00.319 --> 00:57:02.440
at a certain from a certain perspective

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.280
this is so

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:07.839
obvious that you would think that um you

00:57:07.839 --> 00:57:10.559
know it's just it's just so obvious it's

00:57:10.559 --> 00:57:13.839
a hard constraint

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
so

00:57:23.359 --> 00:57:25.760
um yeah this notion of complete

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.599
entanglement if if if the if the if the

00:57:29.599 --> 00:57:31.760
Israelis killed every single one of

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.760
their

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.720
enemies and flourished as a modern

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.640
culture in a safe

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:39.760
environment that would have so much

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.520
cultural trauma that would never go it

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.880
doesn't go away the

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:50.880
entanglement has to be honored for its

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.599
complexity

00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:56.799
um and

00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:00.020
[Music]

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.240
um

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.680
yeah and this is true of course of

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.440
everything the way we're entangled with

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.720
nature

00:58:27.559 --> 00:58:29.440
we're entangled with our bodies we're

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.119
entangled with the environment we're

00:58:31.119 --> 00:58:33.960
entangled with our culture we these

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.400
these

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.839
entanglements

00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:40.839
um

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.400
yeah the only cultures that are not no

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.200
longer entangled are the ones that are

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.640
in Gone in extinct and they're still

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:56.720
entangled in

00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.799
the other cultures you

00:58:59.799 --> 00:59:02.119
know it's like I don't know why I did

00:59:02.119 --> 00:59:03.400
this

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.119
but I mean I knew this but I hadn't

00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:08.280
thought about it in a long time so I

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.880
Googled like what North America looked

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.280
like before the Mexican American War

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:17.799
right I mean they Mexico owned all of

00:59:17.799 --> 00:59:21.319
California all of Arizona all of Texas

00:59:21.319 --> 00:59:22.480
parts of

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.200
Oklahoma right and they like

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.039
Americans walk around and wonder why

00:59:27.039 --> 00:59:29.079
there's so many Latinos in the United

00:59:29.079 --> 00:59:31.440
States like they've taken over the whole

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.880
south of America well there's a lot of

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.359
Latinos because it's the opposite

00:59:37.359 --> 00:59:39.760
there's a lot of Latinos in California

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.599
and Arizona not only because they come

00:59:41.599 --> 00:59:43.440
over here but they come over here

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.359
because like this was

00:59:46.359 --> 00:59:50.000
Mexico like and it's not even it's not

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.640
even in young people's Consciousness

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.079
anymore

00:59:56.079 --> 00:59:57.880
people think that the Mexican-American

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:01.359
War was fought at the Rio Grand to keep

01:00:01.359 --> 01:00:04.200
Mexico down

01:00:04.359 --> 01:00:08.559
there so it's like these That's How

01:00:08.559 --> 01:00:12.319
culture you know these in in stories in

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:16.680
imaginary world

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:21.559
um and of course who was there

01:00:21.559 --> 01:00:26.160
before the quote unquote Mexicans right

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.960
it doesn't there is no there is no

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.720
square one to these stories because

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.799
they're imaginary

01:00:33.799 --> 01:00:36.160
really there's something real that

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.680
happened

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.880
but when they get in story they

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.880
get Frozen in

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.559
time I have a question for you

01:00:49.559 --> 01:00:52.559
Bonnie

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.680
um you had that appetite to find out

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.880
about the

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.680
map um how long did it take

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.200
you to Google it like yeah I don't know

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.599
10

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.160
seconds

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.880
well can we look at what have we here I

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.319
mean

01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:21.720
because I mean I grew up in a country

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.440
with no public

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.920
libraries and I'm not trying to you know

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.240
make comparisons but I physically feel

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.520
in my body when I do a search like I

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.160
just did to put

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.720
this quote from as you like it because I

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.319
remembered only that it was we rip and

01:01:45.319 --> 01:01:51.279
rot you know and thereby hangs a tail um

01:01:51.279 --> 01:01:54.960
and I found it in a split second and so

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.920
I'm just curious I mean intensely

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.079
curious um

01:02:02.079 --> 01:02:04.279
if we're really

01:02:04.279 --> 01:02:07.680
moving through

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.240
this new paradigm I'm going to call it

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:13.799
myelon

01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:17.119
um in terms of how things can be

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:19.680
connected in instance and they're

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.839
connected to so many other

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:28.680
things um that but the past at least 500

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.799
years have been another

01:02:31.799 --> 01:02:36.039
Paradigm which was Gutenberg and

01:02:36.039 --> 01:02:39.000
gunpowder kind of you

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.960
know

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:45.240
um when we talk about

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.799
education like Claudia you know sort of

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:52.079
hesitated you know said no no no this

01:02:52.079 --> 01:02:53.039
one's

01:02:53.039 --> 01:02:56.920
important I I think part of it is that I

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.720
mean we are in the presence of or at

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:05.039
least I am around here of melian natives

01:03:05.039 --> 01:03:06.440
let's

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.599
say and we're

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:10.200
still

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.800
suffocating them with our gunpowder

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.000
[Music]

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.599
Gutenberg

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:25.039
logic you know and I think that you

01:03:25.039 --> 01:03:29.000
reing for this lyric philosophy lyric

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.039
culture and lyric cultural renewal is is

01:03:34.039 --> 01:03:35.880
I

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.680
think matching

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.400
more the way it's no longer about

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.599
overarching stories or or or overarching

01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:50.559
narratives but

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:53.680
Explorations because we have this necro

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.480
mass of archives that at least for now

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.000
is is available to us in an absolutely

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.880
unprecedented

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.520
way

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.880
and again this is not like some

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.839
techno you know Utopia it's more

01:04:12.839 --> 01:04:17.079
that I think we really don't know what's

01:04:17.079 --> 01:04:20.279
possible between

01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:25.000
us and every time I look

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.119
a this

01:04:27.119 --> 01:04:30.559
these rectangles and I just think

01:04:30.559 --> 01:04:33.920
about how impossible this is you know

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.039
somebody in Australia somebody in the US

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:39.039
somebody in New Zealand somebody in

01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:42.079
London somebody in and I'm like this has

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:45.880
got to be changing our how our organisms

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.319
learn how to

01:04:47.319 --> 01:04:50.160
evolve there not something separate from

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.319
all this but it's

01:04:52.319 --> 01:04:54.880
already shifting and I'm just going to

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.480
add a trivial thing but this summer I

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.599
think it was particularly dry and so for

01:05:01.599 --> 01:05:04.319
the first time in my studio I had

01:05:04.319 --> 01:05:07.599
ants and I did the sort of natural thing

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:12.039
of putting vinegar you know whatever um

01:05:12.039 --> 01:05:15.480
and uh you know eventually they left I

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.599
don't know if it had anything to do with

01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:21.760
what I did but they ceased to be all

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.440
over but if I leave one crumb on top of

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.400
my kitchen counter they

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.160
appear out of

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.480
nowhere and I'm I started to look at

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.440
that with such honestly Delight I'm like

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.440
What's the difference between these ants

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:46.440
and me following following crumbs in my

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.440
foraging you know it's like at the end

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.119
of the day if I had to explain to people

01:05:52.119 --> 01:05:56.000
where I've been which between you Bonita

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.039
and and Nora and Aaron Manning and you

01:06:01.039 --> 01:06:03.200
know all this all these other things

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.319
that I'm I'm acting like those ants you

01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:10.960
know and so I

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.760
just I don't know I

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:16.880
think this why I like this audre Lord

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.279
quote because it's like while we suffer

01:06:20.279 --> 01:06:24.200
the old longings battle the old warnings

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.079
and fears of being silent and impotent

01:06:27.079 --> 01:06:29.960
and alone while we

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.520
taste new possibilities and

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.480
strength you know and I think you know

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.240
David's like one of the Prime kind of

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.279
manifestations of

01:06:42.279 --> 01:06:48.240
that he just throws himself into this

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.760
casting and I I know I I knew my

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.119
great-grandfather and there's no way

01:06:54.119 --> 01:06:57.599
that he'd be doing it that way he was

01:06:57.599 --> 01:07:00.880
fighting cuz he defended the Germans and

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.720
and his best friend you know stopped

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.520
talking to him and that was the drama

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.960
for about 25

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.000
years in a small

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:20.000
town so I don't know I just I need

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:27.119
to I need your

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:35.599
help to

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.119
somehow at least accompany some of these

01:07:41.119 --> 01:07:45.960
thoughts so that I don't think it's some

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.760
hallucinatory you know hopeful monster

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.160
kind of

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.920
thing

01:08:11.359 --> 01:08:14.440
I think somewhere in your quote what

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.120
you're reading you know there's this

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.880
emphasis on patience I think the

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.960
patience part is really

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.839
hard

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.960
um

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.839
especially when you start to get a sense

01:08:27.839 --> 01:08:30.359
that something is possible and then you

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.000
want to like make it a

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
wrap wrap it

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
up

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.799
and

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.759
and you know it's weird because you

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:01.159
start to realize that you made it all

01:09:01.159 --> 01:09:03.239
the way here whatever that means for

01:09:03.239 --> 01:09:06.319
each of you here right now not actually

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:09.759
knowing what you were doing or how how

01:09:09.759 --> 01:09:12.040
how you how you are doing

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.279
it then you get this little vision of

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.759
what is

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:20.080
possible and you have to reconcile with

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.960
that with now to get from here to there

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.679
you have to continue you not knowing

01:09:24.679 --> 01:09:27.159
what you're doing you know

01:09:27.159 --> 01:09:30.120
like like because the methodology has

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.520
proved itself uh to be

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.960
useful um

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:43.480
and and so that that that I would call

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:49.560
it interregnum is hard I think um it's

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.159
hard not to slip back into Old tactics

01:09:53.159 --> 01:09:54.440
because you can see see you can start to

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.920
see it now so so it becomes an it and

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.000
then you can get your ducks in a row and

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.679
make it happen um and I'm reminded of

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:09.080
that quote from Christopher Alexander in

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.719
the in The Parallax course it's on the

01:10:11.719 --> 01:10:14.520
recordings if if you are a paid

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.000
subscriber but where he talks about the

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.679
unselfconscious architect right um You

01:10:21.679 --> 01:10:22.640
you're

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.199
only

01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:27.199
the the the larger the larger forces are

01:10:27.199 --> 01:10:29.520
in

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:33.800
Dynamic relation all the time and you

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:38.640
can't get outside and steer them

01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:43.679
um you can only solve local problems you

01:10:43.679 --> 01:10:44.760
know

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.760
so

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.640
um

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.640
yeah

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.640
and you know and I think the more we

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:05.960
talk together the

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.520
more like I'm sure that the

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.640
conversations that CL ofia have have

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:13.080
shifted they may not be satisfactory but

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.600
they've probably shifted from the way I

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.280
used to talk about

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.120
projects um and again that can be very

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.440
frustrating to people because

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.040
because of the kind of patience you know

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.000
because you're

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.800
basically the subtext is yeah we're

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.600
going to do this project uh not knowing

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.040
how we're going to do it kind of thing

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.400
you know this is not easy

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.159
to

01:11:43.159 --> 01:11:46.080
yeah yeah that's exactly right

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.639
um Bonita and it is frustration because

01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:50.159
we it is frustrating because we kind of

01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:53.560
want action right um we kind of want

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.840
want to do something but that just then

01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:00.840
you know we we can't do that

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.080
um we could maybe create

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.280
context

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.760
um and that requires patience actually

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.000
um we could maybe articulate a vision

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.480
of what we

01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:25.199
trust you know we can maybe say

01:12:25.199 --> 01:12:29.480
experimentation is welcome you know

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.719
um so that's why I quite like this

01:12:31.719 --> 01:12:35.400
culture word because culture feels a bit

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.000
like kind of like a

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.800
context maybe

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.520
um so yeah you the language has really

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.840
really

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:51.520
changed um from let's do this and here's

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.960
the action um that we must take you know

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.000
to to this this other thing at least you

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.280
learned you know Anna she's in despair

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.960
because you know Bill Gates and Company

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.159
they they just they haven't learned yet

01:13:07.159 --> 01:13:09.520
they haven't learned that all of that is

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:13.040
like a false prophet you know like you

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.760
you should go back to your team and and

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.199
and recognize that at least we know that

01:13:18.199 --> 01:13:20.719
like all those things they just don't

01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:24.320
work you know things are too in Tangled

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.760
now

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.120
um and if you think about it they don't

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.320
even work across huge power divides I

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.360
mean Israel is much more hugely

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.800
resourced than Palestine and it doesn't

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.800
work you know you can't in in this in

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.480
this entangled world we have

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.040
um you know you could You could argue

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.280
that human technology is much more

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.159
powerful we have the power of gods as

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:01.080
these guys say uh nature is powerless

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.600
but it still doesn't work because at the

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.800
end Nature's like you I'll take all

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.760
the oxygen out of the air you how

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.600
do you like that like it just doesn't

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.199
work it doesn't even work across these

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:17.159
huge power divides you know

01:14:17.159 --> 01:14:20.320
um um which has its positive and its

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.800
negative you know there's a lot of

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.080
deviant forces in the

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:28.199
us uh which are destabilizing because

01:14:28.199 --> 01:14:31.000
people without power understand that it

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.360
doesn't

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:38.040
matter that you can just with

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.080
things and things up and then you

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.159
got people like Elon Musk who's got a

01:14:43.159 --> 01:14:46.040
lot of power who can keep distorting the

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:52.199
reality of people and it and it's a

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.280
very

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.679
you know it's it's a hard lesson to

01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:15.520
learn uh what's operative for me Claudia

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.880
is you still have the arousal to do

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.800
something you still have it I hear it I

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.719
feel you still have the

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:26.760
arousal and I have the arousal to help

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.679
Melena right now and I don't know if

01:15:29.679 --> 01:15:31.800
what I'm going to say will

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.920
help but this idea of honoring just

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.480
honoring the entanglement brought up an

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.560
image for me of you know these

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.600
um gold chains these small gold link

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.560
chains that get all tangled

01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.440
up

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.239
there's no way I sit and just honor the

01:15:58.239 --> 01:16:01.679
entanglement there's no

01:16:01.679 --> 01:16:05.719
way yeah sometimes I got to be patient

01:16:05.719 --> 01:16:09.239
and play and not know what I'm doing and

01:16:09.239 --> 01:16:11.960
but there's no way I can just let that

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:17.520
piece of gold sit over there for very

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:19.400
long

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.840
so matalina why do I jump

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.440
feet first

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.360
in head first

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:32.840
in because I honor the

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.679
arousal not the outcome not the

01:16:36.679 --> 01:16:40.639
longing just that

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.560
arousal I don't know if that helps

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:52.080
mental

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.360
it's I I think that's exactly where I

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.800
mean because the presumption has been I

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.639
think all right I'm going to try to

01:17:04.639 --> 01:17:07.520
articulate this

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:13.040
differ human species crossed the

01:17:14.239 --> 01:17:18.480
threshold on August 6

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.000
1945 and I think we've been

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.040
repressing

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:26.360
that ever

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.120
since with Collective talk about

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.440
collective

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.719
intelligence and the answer to that

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.760
Doom

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:46.120
that I don't see how it's going to go

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.320
away has

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.159
been

01:17:54.159 --> 01:17:58.760
the mad you know mutually assured

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:03.280
destruction translating into hyper

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.560
consumerism and after the fall of the

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.719
wall of Berlin it became the sad self

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:14.280
assured destruction okay but it's still

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.880
relating to the same kind

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.679
of punctuated

01:18:19.679 --> 01:18:22.760
equilibrium that if we continue thinking

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.840
the way we are

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.920
thinking we've already peaked and we

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.800
peaked

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.800
at

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.080
self-termination and I think people

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.719
like the early cyberneticians that's

01:18:40.719 --> 01:18:43.840
what made them gather at the Macy

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.239
conference it was like holy we've

01:18:47.239 --> 01:18:51.520
got to think differently and yet we keep

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:56.360
bringing back this reflex of of

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:03.600
of you know it's such a reflex that's so

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.719
monocultural like the like the rice

01:19:07.719 --> 01:19:09.440
thing

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.600
and I'm not

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.280
looking for Alternatives I think they're

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.159
already here because everything that had

01:19:17.159 --> 01:19:20.120
to happen has already

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.000
happened it's already happened

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.360
it was unevenly and is unevenly

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:31.719
distributed but maybe now that we

01:19:31.719 --> 01:19:36.080
are you know filamentous

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.000
Le

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.679
resonating so we can't just close

01:19:42.679 --> 01:19:46.639
ourselves up and sit in an

01:19:46.639 --> 01:19:49.320
armchair and

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:53.199
philosophies I mean some still do but

01:19:53.199 --> 01:19:56.199
you know and I think that that's what I

01:19:56.199 --> 01:19:59.080
feel in

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:05.120
zi just she's she's pointing to

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.000
the to this

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.639
filamentous call it lyrical but it's

01:20:11.639 --> 01:20:14.679
filamentous to me

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:18.239
okay has a

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:23.880
fality and and it can

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:29.120
swing the micro to the

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:34.199
macro because of the way it's

01:20:34.199 --> 01:20:36.040
all

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.440
entangled but it is it's just like how

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.600
these ants find that crumb you know they

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.159
just know it and I have that capacity to

01:20:47.159 --> 01:20:50.280
I'm going to believe I do

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:55.440
okay I don't think I'd be here if I

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.800
didn't because it's kind of crazy to be

01:21:06.159 --> 01:21:09.360
here and again it reminds me of Adrien

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.480
Rich when she says

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.440
um I think it's in her

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:19.400
60th that she knows experience can

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.639
devour

01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:25.800
language poetry is the refusal to kill

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.000
or be

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.639
killed but this

01:21:30.639 --> 01:21:35.040
continuing is for the sane mad and the

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.120
bravest of Monsters can't believe I just

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:39.520
remembered all

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.440
that but I think it's pretty

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:54.360
close and it's finding the others

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.159
and now you guys are with me when I go

01:21:58.159 --> 01:22:02.239
for a walk here

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.560
okay or

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.840
when you know I have to respond to

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.639
something I would have thought was

01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:14.440
impossible

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.400
before I can reach to something

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.080
else I can I

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.719
can I I you know I mean your your

01:22:24.719 --> 01:22:27.199
workshop on the tools of conviviality

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:31.159
it's like I I've dedicated at least two

01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:34.880
three hours a day since just going

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.679
through all the material that you put

01:22:36.679 --> 01:22:41.159
together I mean the generosity of that

01:22:41.159 --> 01:22:44.600
okay where where would that be happening

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.480
you know in academic institutions you

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.280
know that that are happening right now

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.560
in that

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.960
way

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:59.360
okay I just I need I need to feel that

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:03.480
I'm not just being incredibly selective

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.760
about the

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.320
reality that I choose to pay attention

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.000
to and yet you know

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.520
what autism

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.639
okay as a place to begin

01:23:20.639 --> 01:23:23.800
again because I think think the kind of

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.679
narrow

01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:27.320
impairment

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:30.080
that has been

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.520
forced by this

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.480
industrialization of

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:39.480
arousal

01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:42.600
okay you

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.600
know

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:51.120
yeah sorry I'm kind

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.480
of yeah

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.719
one other the things we can

01:24:03.719 --> 01:24:06.840
do is

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.760
[Music]

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.400
um you know in our daily lives outside

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:16.040
of this context is look for

01:24:16.199 --> 01:24:20.920
signs signs that things are

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.360
happening

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.760
um because recently as I said there are

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.920
some interesting

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.080
synchronicities that are coming down the

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.600
pike

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.920
and

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.400
since we want to be putting out more

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.840
breadcrumbs um

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.040
just yeah just look for

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:00.800
some signs that

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.880
uh because I'm kind of on the lookout

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.800
for signs right

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.280
now one happened this

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.480
morning cuz I was asked to go open the

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:28.920
gate to the ruined school I mean it's a

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.199
school that's a ruin from

01:25:32.199 --> 01:25:34.239
2008 and

01:25:34.239 --> 01:25:40.360
um I saw Wendy who's actual teacher come

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.639
in a little late and she

01:25:43.639 --> 01:25:47.880
got accosted by one of the parents that

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.520
other parents say is

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.920
difficult and his

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.920
in the Israeli Community

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:01.239
here um and he was just

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:05.320
outraged because he hadn't met me so who

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.560
was I to be opening the door and you

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.040
know whatever it just escalated

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:14.400
schismogenesis

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.719
immediately and um we

01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:22.719
were just quiet and I told wend he just

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:25.239
just let me do this because you know

01:26:25.239 --> 01:26:28.800
she's the teacher I can I'm Expendable

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.840
I'm

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:33.560
disposable and and I I really thought

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:36.800
about the

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.280
dispositionality you know I and and for

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.400
that I had to be silent and he's just

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.119
looking at

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.199
me and I continued to be

01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:54.320
silent and it was like

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.560
five it felt like 5 minutes at

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.800
least and then he put his head down and

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.000
he said I'm really

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.199
stressed his mother had fallen broken a

01:27:12.199 --> 01:27:16.760
hip and he had to fly to Israel

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:19.760
right

01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:22.840
now

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.360
you

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:28.719
know so the signs I want to give back to

01:27:28.719 --> 01:27:29.560
you

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:32.639
Bonita because of how hard you

01:27:32.639 --> 01:27:38.040
work okay and toil at this

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:42.679
soil okay you really

01:27:43.199 --> 01:27:46.480
toil I know you

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.199
do and I'll never

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.199
know the signs are coming from within me

01:27:55.199 --> 01:27:58.960
and from the outside those are signs but

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.199
the ones I can really testify to are the

01:28:02.199 --> 01:28:05.600
ones that are coming from

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:15.800
within yeah you know for me that

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.480
conviviality course was was

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.960
interesting um there there's a couple of

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.639
decisions that I've made you know

01:28:22.639 --> 01:28:23.560
they're

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.639
they're relatively small like that

01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:29.239
encounter but they're me big meaning in

01:28:29.239 --> 01:28:36.199
meaning um that I've made uh because you

01:28:36.199 --> 01:28:39.440
know when I was emphasizing the Good

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.639
Samaritan the religious impulse of Good

01:28:41.639 --> 01:28:43.840
Samaritan and I found

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.679
myself

01:28:45.679 --> 01:28:49.800
making easily making decisions that

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.560
would have previously surprised urised

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.119
my me because I kind of talked myself

01:28:55.119 --> 01:28:57.199
into that by giving that chorus you know

01:28:57.199 --> 01:28:59.080
like because remember at the end I was

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.840
like I'm channeling ill now you know and

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:05.520
I'm and

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:09.760
um and absolutely and then when I'm when

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.159
that that happened to me on the inside

01:29:13.159 --> 01:29:15.520
at the same time I was starting to write

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:18.400
something then an email came in from the

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.080
person I was thinking

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.520
about um

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.280
who is you know the Good Samaritan is

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:27.480
definitely

01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.199
other not on your friends list um and

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.719
we're going to be in dialogue so there

01:29:33.719 --> 01:29:37.960
are things happening

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.159
um I love what you said yeah it it's you

01:29:44.159 --> 01:29:45.400
let this stuff work on your

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.400
dispositional state and then the clarity

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:53.920
can flow forth from there um

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.960
getting to that point is hard but once

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:02.040
you get it it's not that hard

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:04.440
like because what's being what you're

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.159
asking yourself to do is only

01:30:06.159 --> 01:30:08.480
psychologically hard just be quiet right

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.960
just settle down that's not it's not

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.520
like trying to run into Bill Gates's

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:17.000
office and have an argument with him um

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.960
so I think these

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:24.400
these new expressions of body and space

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.320
um you know they're tied into we might

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.600
talk about this next year magic reality

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.000
the causal

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.800
manifold um I've been tweeting about it

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.480
get people curious um but that's that's

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:40.639
what we're talking about how does how

01:30:40.639 --> 01:30:44.119
does change in my dispositional state

01:30:44.119 --> 01:30:45.920
actually change the world well you

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:48.000
changed the world for this person he's

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.280
got to go to Israel things are happening

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.840
in Israel this is is a direct link

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.600
to a Glo you know a a real phenomenon

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:00.400
it's not just self-improvement that's

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.080
not what we're really about

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.119
here because that's also the reality of

01:31:06.119 --> 01:31:08.080
the world we're living

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.480
in maybe not everywhere but I mean you

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.280
know I remember that when I first came

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:18.639
to this Village from Boston to decide

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.520
whether I was moving

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.119
here um and I spent three weeks here in

01:31:24.119 --> 01:31:28.600
January it was a Romanian waitress who

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:31.920
gave me the

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.520
trust

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:36.679
because she was in the only Cafe that

01:31:36.679 --> 01:31:39.600
was open she had learned how to speak

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:43.800
Portuguese fluently

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:46.280
beautifully and she asked me a few

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.159
questions and I told her what I was

01:31:48.159 --> 01:31:49.480
trying to

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.560
decide and she sat down with

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:58.119
me you know it wasn't the familiarity of

01:31:58.119 --> 01:32:00.159
coming back to the country that I happen

01:32:00.159 --> 01:32:02.400
to have a passport once an immigrant

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.119
always an immigrant it's just the way it

01:32:06.119 --> 01:32:11.960
is but she brought me

01:32:13.159 --> 01:32:16.520
here you know so I think this is the

01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.600
reality of of the world we're living in

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.520
whether virtually

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:27.440
I mean or or in person or in an airport

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.760
we're crossing stories from everywhere

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:35.920
this was not the case before as

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.800
much or

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:42.719
things just were not in such vibration I

01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:44.159
mean there's a

01:32:44.159 --> 01:32:47.159
vibrational

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.239
intensity the profound arousal state of

01:32:51.239 --> 01:32:53.639
the world

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.920
you said

01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.360
it

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.760
Suzy my

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:14.480
love what's going on in that noodle of

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.560
yours

01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:27.639
well I don't really know what to say

01:33:27.639 --> 01:33:30.639
today it's a very cool I like being here

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:33.600
thank you I have a deep sadness about

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.880
the Hamas Israel situation like I feel

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:40.080
most people here

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:44.320
do and I do say Hamas not

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:49.800
Palestine um but signs can I go to signs

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:53.560
just put down that for a little minute

01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:59.679
I feel

01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:04.520
that whatever whatever space I'm in

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.719
whatever

01:34:05.719 --> 01:34:09.239
is where my attention is where my intent

01:34:09.239 --> 01:34:13.639
is then there are many signs come many

01:34:13.639 --> 01:34:15.639
syn synchronicities

01:34:15.639 --> 01:34:19.800
it's it's just happens all the time it's

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:23.480
more am I

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:29.080
listening or am I allowing what is so

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.159
obviously pres presented so obviously

01:34:33.159 --> 01:34:34.679
there

01:34:34.679 --> 01:34:37.639
um I thought of a little

01:34:37.639 --> 01:34:40.080
sign and it has stayed with me for a

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.040
little while and

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:47.119
it I can't hold everything so that's I

01:34:47.119 --> 01:34:49.000
like the signs because it keeps it

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.800
simple in a way um there

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.920
just too much I can't be in all of it

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:59.080
and at the moment

01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:02.840
and I I don't know if this relates in

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.639
any way to what you've been talking

01:35:04.639 --> 01:35:08.199
about magdalina or not but it feels like

01:35:08.199 --> 01:35:10.400
it

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:14.400
does instead of like there's things

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.719
going on all the time there's ener like

01:35:17.719 --> 01:35:19.760
for me it's energies always but there's

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.199
a lot of Energies at the moment for me

01:35:24.199 --> 01:35:27.520
that are showing as

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.880
signs of where I want to

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:37.560
say people are are sensing it everybody

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.760
is sensing this and if I talk about um

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.199
going to the hairdresser for example or

01:35:44.199 --> 01:35:47.000
I talk about talking with some of my

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.320
neighbors these are not people who will

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.400
be coming

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.719
here these are not great

01:35:53.719 --> 01:35:56.400
philosophical um people and I don't mean

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:58.360
the old academic analytical

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:01.560
philosophical I love this the love of

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:05.080
clarity um from the

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.040
lyrical but what I notice in what I

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:12.960
think is a sign is that these often

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:15.520
these people would talk about something

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:18.040
that concerned them something in the

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:20.679
world it would take the form of a

01:36:20.679 --> 01:36:22.840
complaint

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.400
um and are very binary often and very

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.719
often are them and us and then they

01:36:27.719 --> 01:36:30.119
would come up with a

01:36:30.119 --> 01:36:34.800
solution very much

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.280
um no not much complexity at all but a

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.199
solution which really is just going to

01:36:40.199 --> 01:36:42.119
create more problems really and it's not

01:36:42.119 --> 01:36:44.679
going to really work at all but that was

01:36:44.679 --> 01:36:49.480
fine but what I'm noticing now is that

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.000
PE people don't have an answer people

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.320
are confused people are sitting with

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:00.400
thises they don't know whereas before

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.480
they did or they thought they did or

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.560
maybe they did I don't know but this is

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:09.600
is for me quite a this is a sign to me

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.040
of quite a shift and in some ways it's

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.280
showing up the moment we've got our

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.760
voting day is

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:22.360
Saturday um

01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:24.080
I can't take it too seriously the

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.840
election and the sense of where they're

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.560
going I mean it's all money based stuff

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.239
um and it's all again once again it's

01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:33.960
solution based but you hear people

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:36.960
saying they're not actually addressing

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:40.719
what we need to address they're not

01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:43.800
actually we're not actually putting

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.199
ourselves as it were in a space and they

01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:49.360
don't know how to do it but they sense

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.679
that there's something here missing they

01:37:51.679 --> 01:37:54.880
didn't do that six years ago that was

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.280
not something six years ago that was

01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:02.040
happening um and so that's that that for

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:06.360
me is where I often like to be is just

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.119
listening what is this the energy here

01:38:09.119 --> 01:38:12.119
that I'm picking up and that is in me

01:38:12.119 --> 01:38:14.639
and yeah so that that's part of it for

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:16.119
me what are the

01:38:16.119 --> 01:38:17.960
signs

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.719
um yeah so that that feels significant

01:38:21.719 --> 01:38:27.440
and it's definitely the case

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:29.920
that I mean I don't really know how to

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.360
explain this very well like if I think

01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.920
of Zack Stein like you think of Z Zack

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.119
Stein often when he starts talking it's

01:38:38.119 --> 01:38:40.360
just like wow there's this lovely

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.679
invitation come on be in the cosmos like

01:38:42.679 --> 01:38:45.159
you're just there and it's lovely but

01:38:45.159 --> 01:38:46.760
there's also

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:49.000
this there's the there's that

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.920
oscillating energy as well

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.920
that makes me feel humble and

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.440
small not insignificant but just how

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:03.360
where I live in this whole big thing

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.440
whatever it is I'm talking about because

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.199
those energies those oscillating

01:39:09.199 --> 01:39:12.159
energies

01:39:12.159 --> 01:39:16.599
um I can sense those but they're much

01:39:16.599 --> 01:39:19.280
bigger than me I mean who am I really in

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:22.599
that context who are we in that

01:39:22.599 --> 01:39:27.040
context yeah and may I just this always

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.159
happens when I talk here there's another

01:39:29.159 --> 01:39:33.000
thing that really really came up for me

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.719
when people were talking

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:39.239
today which is from David hinton's work

01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:41.520
um our book club has just finished

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.520
reading that book and it's been very

01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:47.440
interesting I've enjoyed it very much

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.960
where we've gone and where we haven't

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.719
gone and it does feel a good place to go

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:54.000
to this lyric philosophy next so that's

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.880
my going to be my

01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.360
suggestion um but I David

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:03.480
Hinton in talking about the sixth

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.440
Extinction is also speaking

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.480
of the

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.239
human creature the

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:16.560
human as a force as a force of nature

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.560
like you can see that there was

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:24.199
the other five extensions

01:40:24.199 --> 01:40:29.159
arose because of natural or because of

01:40:29.159 --> 01:40:30.400
forces of

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.280
nature

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.320
volcano asteroids whatever the question

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:37.840
for me in this context of what he's

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:42.440
speaking of is are we a force of

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.960
Nature and is this

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:47.360
something I mean we know that we're

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:50.400
adding to we we're destroying our own

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.239
environment and since we're committing

01:40:52.239 --> 01:40:55.800
suicide you could say but is there

01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:00.239
something Beyond like a a not able to be

01:41:00.239 --> 01:41:02.440
grasped fully by myself I'm not sure I

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:05.599
fully can grasp how we are a force of

01:41:05.599 --> 01:41:07.400
nature I don't want to say the

01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.560
inevitability of it but we are doing

01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:14.080
what we're doing in the same way in one

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.599
sense and the same way as the asteroid

01:41:16.599 --> 01:41:18.320
is doing what it

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.040
did and what's the problem with that

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.480
that I I'm was that a

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:26.080
problem what needs to go for something

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.320
new to

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:30.560
come and I take his point I mean there

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.599
is a sense

01:41:32.599 --> 01:41:36.199
of you I don't want that but there's

01:41:36.199 --> 01:41:37.880
also

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:40.520
maybe anyway I'm going that's all of the

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.679
things well there's a lot more but I

01:41:42.679 --> 01:41:45.119
can't hold everything at the moment so

01:41:45.119 --> 01:41:49.040
that's all I have to say at the moment

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.080
um and I'm not sure how to unpay

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:56.880
loss it's a very

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.679
interesting have you lost what you never

01:42:00.679 --> 01:42:04.119
had like is that just in the imagination

01:42:04.119 --> 01:42:06.760
I don't I

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:11.599
don't anyway that's all where I'm at

01:42:11.599 --> 01:42:13.679
today I think I

01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:17.239
feel and I just want to say one more

01:42:17.239 --> 01:42:20.119
little thing it always seems important

01:42:20.119 --> 01:42:21.760
now for me

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.639
just to be in my community or

01:42:24.639 --> 01:42:27.360
communities and just ordinary little

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.880
things to be

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:33.719
doing that is really where I'm at and

01:42:33.719 --> 01:42:36.960
that's causes great learning for me to

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.440
work with a woman for example at the

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.719
moment a young L who is a very brave

01:42:41.719 --> 01:42:43.719
lady she's done some amazing things and

01:42:43.719 --> 01:42:46.480
I really admire her in that regard but

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:48.440
her and I have very very different

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.560
values and very different perspectives

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.840
on on how the world works on how we see

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:56.480
things and even and this is in specific

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.639
context that we're dealing with but

01:42:58.639 --> 01:43:00.840
because our intent is the same and

01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:03.239
because of our love for the people

01:43:03.239 --> 01:43:07.159
involved it easily resolves something

01:43:07.159 --> 01:43:10.400
always happens that it's like oh that's

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.960
cool and then we just laugh and we be

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:16.880
with what is and how we are

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.239
really we are very different with our

01:43:19.239 --> 01:43:21.800
values but not with what we love and not

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:25.040
with the goodness and the kindness that

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:29.080
and the care that we feel and so this is

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.639
there's a great trust and and love there

01:43:31.639 --> 01:43:32.760
now

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.199
and I don't know I just find this

01:43:35.199 --> 01:43:37.400
happens more and more for

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:40.440
me I notice my neighbor I have a a

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:42.599
neighbor who her and her husband are

01:43:42.599 --> 01:43:44.800
very good neighbors to me they help me

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:46.599
or they offer a lot of help sometimes

01:43:46.599 --> 01:43:48.080
it's bloody annoying and I wish they'd

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:51.360
 off but they do offer a lot of

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:54.280
some things are really really great but

01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.880
this is another situation where we work

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:00.320
together on a very simple little project

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.880
where the F family we know the me and my

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.679
family have got all these cats that were

01:44:04.679 --> 01:44:07.400
just overrunning them and this is not

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.119
something that

01:44:09.119 --> 01:44:13.480
they that they um they don't want to do

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.599
anything really about the cats except

01:44:15.599 --> 01:44:17.880
finally I convinced the mom that if she

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.560
keeps allowing all these cats to have

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:21.320
kittens they're going to

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.239
run their life I mean their whole back

01:44:23.239 --> 01:44:25.440
out will be full of hundreds of cats but

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:28.080
the really interesting thing was working

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.719
with sus that my neighbor who's really

01:44:31.719 --> 01:44:35.800
into um she belongs to a voluntary

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.239
organization that helps people whove it

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:41.239
helps cats and people with too many cats

01:44:41.239 --> 01:44:43.599
and whatever now I don't agree with a

01:44:43.599 --> 01:44:45.800
great deal of her attitudes towards them

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:46.679
as

01:44:46.679 --> 01:44:49.080
animals but the way in which we work

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.599
together and solve this problem

01:44:51.599 --> 01:44:53.960
for the family in a way that everyone

01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:56.320
felt comfortable and there was some

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.000
sadness and loss there because one of

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.560
the mother cats lost um all the babies

01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:04.199
died and she and the kittens they were

01:45:04.199 --> 01:45:05.599
just little and they all died and there

01:45:05.599 --> 01:45:07.000
was a lot of

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.280
sadness but somehow it's this ability to

01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:15.199
be in relationship with Susanna with the

01:45:15.199 --> 01:45:17.280
inent that didn't it didn't really

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.239
matter in some ways that she

01:45:21.239 --> 01:45:23.440
would do things very differently given

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:27.159
half a chance I and I wanted to do

01:45:27.159 --> 01:45:28.800
things differently but somehow it all

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:31.000
worked out fine it

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.679
just that's what I what I have to say is

01:45:34.679 --> 01:45:37.840
yeah I just stay in in my community and

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:41.000
stay in the simple really though I love

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
this conversation I think it's amazing

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
and I really enjoyed um listening to um

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.719
Jeremy Johnson I thought that was a

01:45:51.719 --> 01:45:55.040
brilliant brilliant piece of what he had

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.280
30 minutes yeah and I remembered and

01:45:58.280 --> 01:45:59.760
when I was listening I remember the

01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:02.199
first time I heard him speak this sense

01:46:02.199 --> 01:46:06.679
of relief I just cried was like oh thank

01:46:06.679 --> 01:46:10.520
God that was so relieved to hear Jeremy

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.159
Johnson speak about

01:46:13.159 --> 01:46:15.800
gibbsa um but I just thought that that

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.760
30 minute piece was brilliant and this

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.599
is a synchronicity of how love

01:46:20.599 --> 01:46:23.800
beautifully it followed from us our

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.760
group with the David hinton's work it

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:30.280
just perfect synchronicity and then the

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:32.199
lyric philosophy it's perfect

01:46:32.199 --> 01:46:35.880
synchronicity I I really really like it

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:37.920
I'm going to be quiet now that's a lot

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.520
of talking I'm going to

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.800
shush thank you for

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.199
listening

01:46:45.199 --> 01:46:47.480
so one of the things that happened this

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.480
week is or I guess last week is uh

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:53.239
Jonathan rouson I think most of you know

01:46:53.239 --> 01:46:55.159
him

01:46:55.159 --> 01:46:57.280
somewhat

01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.560
um if you look at the evolution of

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.440
Jonathan rouson over the last couple of

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.000
years it's it's it's it's really

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.159
astounding um and uh and Lal because he

01:47:10.159 --> 01:47:12.960
he lives in a you know very British

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:16.480
Oxford Harvard type of academic world he

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.480
runs

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:19.960
organizations that have funders that

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:22.960
live in that World um and then he starts

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:25.360
sniffing around across the pond to crazy

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:28.480
people like Zack Stein and me look at

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.080
that I mean some people are so lucky I

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:33.199
got a dog barking at

01:47:33.199 --> 01:47:40.280
me um and and um he's someone who's

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.239
who's paying

01:47:43.239 --> 01:47:45.960
attention and so he started a new

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.719
substack he sent it to me he's like what

01:47:47.719 --> 01:47:50.320
do you think of this idea blah blah blah

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.040
couple months ago and then he started

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:55.360
and he's got this great new substat

01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:00.679
project called um leading from

01:48:01.159 --> 01:48:06.760
confusion um which is uh he credits me

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:08.440
because I told him that he leads from

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.960
confusion I guess that conversation we

01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:16.320
had um and it's really it really

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.440
um you know it's a sign of you know it's

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.760
thing for like me and Nora Bon to say

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:25.480
things like that but when you can bring

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:28.920
people from a different context that

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.080
doesn't really suit their

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.040
personality but they move in gracefully

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:35.800
he's not like one of these guys who's

01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.679
not GNA Co-op the whole idea of LEL

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:42.280
whatever I mean it's it's he's allowed

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:46.360
things to shape and work on himself so

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.920
um so I just mention it because you said

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.960
something about confusion

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:53.960
and that you notice that people they may

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.760
be on different sides of the story but

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:59.880
they're too confused to take a stand um

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.280
and um I had a conversation like this

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.040
with my sister yesterday at my the other

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:08.199
day at my mom's house um in terms of

01:49:08.199 --> 01:49:10.480
politics we we don't really

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.880
agree and you know we're sisters we can

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.920
get into these things where if I say one

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.320
thing she's going to take the other's

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.000
position but basically what we agreed is

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.239
that we look at the people the

01:49:21.239 --> 01:49:24.119
politicians

01:49:24.119 --> 01:49:26.920
and if you actually listen to what like

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:29.840
Camala Harris says like we're comparing

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:33.320
Camala Harris with AOC okay Alexander

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:36.639
octovia now AOC she's young she's got

01:49:36.639 --> 01:49:39.960
the woke kind of culture she's got she's

01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:44.400
been a you know she's not a well put

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.400
together educated person but when she

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.440
interrogates someone and she's mad at

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:52.840
them she knows how to she she has her

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.280
facts straight and blah blah blah blah

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.239
blah blah right so we used her an

01:49:57.239 --> 01:49:59.480
example because she's not like the

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.800
poster child for my sister's idea of a

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:04.280
politician or

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.360
something but then when you listen to

01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:09.000
Camala Harris who was like an attorney

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.920
general she's like a zombie she can't

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.480
put two sentences together and we're

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:19.360
like what is like like what is going on

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.320
you know we weren't talking about Camala

01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:24.239
Harris's politics we were saying here's

01:50:24.239 --> 01:50:26.639
this young girl she's like a blah blah

01:50:26.639 --> 01:50:28.880
blah every if I ran into her and it's

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:31.000
you know she's irritating but at least

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:31.840
she

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:34.719
can express her opinion and put the

01:50:34.719 --> 01:50:37.239
screws to someone she doesn't like right

01:50:37.239 --> 01:50:39.199
very

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:41.840
classic single Loop

01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.520
Logics but then you have this woman that

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:47.719
you can't even understand or

01:50:47.719 --> 01:50:50.719
how you can't understand

01:50:50.719 --> 01:50:52.960
how they got to

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:55.719
be attorney general and then you know

01:50:55.719 --> 01:50:58.560
it's like it's just confusing it's un

01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.440
understandable what is going on and and

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:06.920
so um she just reads from scripts and

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.239
she gets she reads it wrong you know

01:51:09.239 --> 01:51:12.320
whatever so the that you know I think

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.719
that's it's gotten to be such

01:51:14.719 --> 01:51:17.400
a they and they want you confused you

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:20.440
know they don't they don't try to uh uh

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.159
spell things

01:51:22.159 --> 01:51:26.159
out uh in in any way so it's very

01:51:26.159 --> 01:51:30.079
confusing and um and I agree that that's

01:51:30.079 --> 01:51:35.000
that's that's in this time a good sign

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.239
perhaps um the only thing

01:51:38.239 --> 01:51:41.880
is society is complex and too much

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:44.960
confusions can you know also be be a

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.040
problem

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.679
but so that's that's one thing but I

01:51:48.679 --> 01:51:51.760
really like this this

01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.960
there's something lyric there's

01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:56.480
something of lyric culture in this move

01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:02.079
that Jonathan is making and

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:07.639
um and also if you have a lyric attitude

01:52:07.639 --> 01:52:10.480
just oh let me say this don't buy this

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:13.560
book for your book club if that's the

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.360
one you thinking of

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.320
buying this is a this is a book that's

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.560
meant to be a you have to practice with

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:23.840
it it's not I would I would either buy

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:27.960
once a time Once Upon a Time in the

01:52:28.079 --> 01:52:31.800
West yeah I would buy this

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:35.599
book by Jan Z

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:39.920
wikii so Bonnie what's the PDF um that

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.480
you put in the notes is that those are

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:45.560
three articles about janza Wiki's work

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.840
oh and one is written by herself

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:52.440
uh but those are more like but janza

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:54.800
wikii gets really beautiful in her own

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.840
personal Reflections about her life on

01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.599
the farm and as a teacher and this is

01:53:00.599 --> 01:53:03.000
this is this

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.560
is this is a book that

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:09.079
interposes academic philosophy with

01:53:09.079 --> 01:53:12.239
artwork and it it's more of a practice

01:53:12.239 --> 01:53:14.199
book

01:53:14.199 --> 01:53:17.000
um it's expensive I wouldn't I wouldn't

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.639
use it for book club but once upon a

01:53:19.639 --> 01:53:21.719
time Time in the West essays on politics

01:53:21.719 --> 01:53:24.480
thought and Imagination is very very

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:28.800
good this is the first book I read of

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:34.560
hers sorry I can give you the PDF of

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:38.440
this huge book if you if you like

01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:51.760
it

01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:54.119
but B you were saying the lyric attitude

01:53:54.119 --> 01:53:55.400
what were you going to say there what's

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:57.719
you know oh yes so the lyric attitude

01:53:57.719 --> 01:53:59.320
and that's this is what the book does

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:03.639
well is it just it notices this wiin

01:54:03.639 --> 01:54:07.040
sign says this it notices box Cannon is

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:10.079
like a wienstein statement so because

01:54:10.079 --> 01:54:13.840
you're not organizing propositions

01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:16.719
hierarchically toward a judgment when

01:54:16.719 --> 01:54:19.400
you do that you can't you won't see a

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.000
lot of synchronicities because they have

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.560
to fit into this this narrow stream that

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:28.000
you've built but when

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
you're what you know interested in music

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.360
and poetry and like we do at the pop-up

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.440
school and we type you'll notice a lot

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.000
more synchronicities because there's a

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.920
lot more hooks to hang your hats

01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:44.079
on and then things start to Ping on each

01:54:44.079 --> 01:54:50.119
other and and um yeah so if I have a

01:54:50.119 --> 01:54:52.960
propositional explanatory idea of

01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:55.840
something it's it's starts Broad and it

01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.800
ends up having a conclusion very few

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:00.760
things are going to fit into that

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:03.960
because it's too narrow it's it's sub

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:06.560
substracted it's my new word if you see

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:09.199
it's not a typ typo substracted it's

01:55:09.199 --> 01:55:12.239
like subtracted and abstracted it's

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:14.760
substracted too much of reality from the

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:17.800
from the world um

01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:23.480
so um so and that's what Susan was also

01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:26.040
uh demonstrating that you know you

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.360
watches Jeremy Johnson and then the book

01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:31.840
club and David Hinton you have all these

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:35.320
voices that somehow as as Jan Wii said

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.400
they're families they hang together but

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:42.880
no one's getting together and creating a

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:46.199
meta systemic analysis of

01:55:46.199 --> 01:55:51.599
reality you know um but

01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.679
somehow yeah somehow they hang together

01:55:55.679 --> 01:55:57.320
so you don't feel like I mean if you

01:55:57.320 --> 01:55:59.079
examine your life you might think I'm

01:55:59.079 --> 01:56:01.040
all over the place if you look at it too

01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.599
critically but somehow you

01:56:04.599 --> 01:56:07.360
know that there's intelligent

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:09.719
information coming through this this

01:56:09.719 --> 01:56:11.560
kind of

01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:14.760
process um but it's very hard to say

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:18.280
what it is because it's not it's not

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.280
arranged Sy

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:23.119
systematically

01:56:23.119 --> 01:56:26.679
um does that make

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:32.560
sense there's something about Jeremy J

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:35.280
like Jeremy Johnson and gser when we

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:38.679
were W looked at illich he talked about

01:56:38.679 --> 01:56:40.639
the transition

01:56:40.639 --> 01:56:43.920
from tribal circular time

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:47.119
to Messianic prophetic time and lot you

01:56:47.119 --> 01:56:48.920
see Ah that's just like gser and that's

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.639
like jerem and Jeremy says something

01:56:50.639 --> 01:56:52.199
it's like that and this one's saying

01:56:52.199 --> 01:56:54.159
something like that because there is

01:56:54.159 --> 01:56:57.239
something there is

01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:01.599
some emergent something that hangs all

01:57:01.599 --> 01:57:03.000
these things

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.280
together um but without this attitude of

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:09.000
sampling you know like we all sample

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.840
from a lot of different places then you

01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:13.639
wouldn't have you wouldn't feel the

01:57:13.639 --> 01:57:16.719
synchronicity of the

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.599
moment

01:57:20.599 --> 01:57:21.880
real quickly I wanted to bring this up

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:25.320
earlier but we got distracted

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:28.040
um when you brought up the manifold of

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.239
reality so I don't know if you've seen

01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:34.000
it my this my profile photo is actually

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.239
generated by

01:57:35.239 --> 01:57:38.560
Dolly and I put in Bonnie your prompt

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:40.360
your definition of synchronicity so I

01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.880
put in sense of the causal manifold of

01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:45.079
reality and this is one of the things I

01:57:45.079 --> 01:57:47.480
got I thought it was pretty neat it's

01:57:47.480 --> 01:57:49.119
got like the angel I won't explain it

01:57:49.119 --> 01:57:51.480
too much but it's kind of kind of funny

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.599
what happens when you you know mess

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:55.520
around with the

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:59.199
algorithm yeah I think it's

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.239
cool okay my

01:58:02.239 --> 01:58:04.679

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.840
conversation with

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.359

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.159
it's so crazy because I feel like that

conversation was already happening

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
inside my head like big time I I think

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.119
you remember we were in the conviviality

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.200
thing and I said Andrew you've got to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.920
get these two on the same you know

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.600
conversation

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.400
and it it it just I I haven't finished

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.560
because I've gone so slow you know I'm

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.439
I'm going

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.360
through you know not even step by step

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.840
it's like this cognitive co-evolution as

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.920
an experience okay because it is the two

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.799
of you being these

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.719
um you know I

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.719
think

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.119
um it I feel like I'm receiving messages

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.560
from the future from both of you you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.000
know in in this crazy way and i' I've

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.640
honestly never seen Alexander so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
rigorous because of you okay because he

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.560
goes off on these

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.560
provocative tangents just to like

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.519
provoke but he has no need to do that

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.160
with you and that is just so exciting

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.959
because then he's at his

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.040
best but you're keeping him you know

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.560
just in this Rhythm you know it's like

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080
there's this Rhythm and it's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.200
so exciting I mean and and nobody has

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.879
ever really engaged this way with

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.680
somebody who has spent a fair amount of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.920
time trying to dig into this melian age

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.200
if I want to use Pascal's you know you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.400
know sort of paradigmatic

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.200
designation and I'm I'm just so grateful

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.840
I mean this like really had to happen

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.760
and it had to cross the ocean it

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.239
just really had to happen and I think

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.760
it's such a crucial moment and I felt

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.159
like you what you came through of course

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.720
I'm informed by all the work we've been

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
doing um that my listening is is not

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.120
quite as illiterate as as it would have

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.439
been

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.439
otherwise but seriously I mean and it's

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.599
the whole thing I mean which includes

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.439
the performance you know which I think

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.439
is crucial right now because we are in

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.640
the melian age and we're not just in the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.400
Gutenberg realm it has to have this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.319
Dynamic you know instability that you

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.840
don't know what's going to happen

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.400
whether you're going to start yelling at

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.239
each other or whether you know and yet

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.319
you navigated it with such

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.480
elegant I mean it's just you know you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.959
know hats off really banina I'm just

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.160
beside myself I'm so excited thank you

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.960
did anybody else see that yet

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.880
no we had that one I had the perspectiva

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.720
presentation and tempor that was pretty

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.000
good um yeah it was good right um oh it

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.400
was amazing but this was so Dynamic you

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.639
know it's like because people don't

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.840
really I haven't seen you in dialogue

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.080
where there's an engagement that goes

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.400
out that just goes out in the wilderness

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.360
that goes out in in in the wildness you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.440
know quite that way I mean either

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.600
they're intimidated by you or something

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.960
or they just skirt around it but this

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.919
was a

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.440
dance loved it I don't know how you feel

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.240
about it but I'd be very curious how you

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.479
feel about it no it was great I I didn't

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.759
watch the recording and I don't know if

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.720
they let it in they did they leave in

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.520
that part where I had to go and sign for

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.720
a

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.319
delivery I I think that's right at the

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.400
end end or or it's toward the middle but

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.120
I yeah no you had to walk away and and

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.600
in that moment um uh Alexander says to

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.319
Andrew we're we're we're right in it

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.520
we're right in it this is a great start

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.479
you know I mean honestly he he really

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.639
just totally engaged and I'm so excited

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.680
because I think this is the kind

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.960
of uh symbiotic and an agonism that I

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.720
feel needs to be happening you know

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.120
whether you want to call it ritual

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.840
descent or whatever for there to be for

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.599
it to come alive so it's not this you

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.000
know just verbera you know of of

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.039
philosophy no the stakes are high you

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.039
know and and and it's full

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.199
on sorry I'm really no no no yeah I'm

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.759
glad you said that there's a lot

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.520
happening like part of it part of what's

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.199
happening is

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.759
this

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.400
uh um push of mind to to develop the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.840
popup school to you know to what did I

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.280
write I don't even remember what I wrote

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.360
what did I write 2024 is the year what

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.440
did I

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.360
write that we break out

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.400
um and

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.400
um

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.520
I'm just gonna put in the chat okay

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.080
because I just put

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.840
um yeah I'm not gonna say okay so

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.879
there's a lot going on go I'm really

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:16.000
loud right because I can hear myself is

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.919
no can I hear myself I have this weird

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:24.120
microphone so if I'm okay that's okay um

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.319
so part of what's happening is this like

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.240
breaking out and um

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.919
also

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.479
wanting um people to know that if you're

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.800
basically the big premium is for yearly

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.479
paid subscribers because if you're

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.280
yearly paid

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.319
subscribers I mean in this case the

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:46.000
Alexander Bard thing was completely free

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.599
but like everything I do will come in as

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:53.039
a recorded at least a recorded version

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.759
um and so I'm trying

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.800
to um go out and add value in you know

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.280
go out and add value in in in a certain

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.319
way and I have other initiatives too um

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:07.400
that people are proposing to me but it's

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.919
for me it's always like well how can

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.199
this how can this benefit yearly paid

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:16.280
subscribers I mean that's kind of my

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.840
target audience

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.479
um but and we're planning to do there's

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:24.360
going to be another uh one with that

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.199
what that that one was supposed to be

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:29.840
with also Alexander eling um but he

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.120
broke his leg and it's kind of good

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.560
because we had able to establish more

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.959
back background and then we're gonna

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.279
have one more with him and then we're

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:41.159
gonna have a series next year which will

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.320
be part of like what the what we bring

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.200
in to the

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.560
school um and you know it is a kind of

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.720
dance it's a kind of dance of allowing

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.519
these hyper creative people to be

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:56.839
creative but how many times did I say

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:59.839
I'm gonna ask you a question I'm gonna

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.959
ask you a question at the end of this uh

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.279
Alexander because they get into this

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.000
like they just they're just explosions

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.839
of creative like blah blah

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.519
blah and

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.480
um so that's that's part of it with them

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.200
there's other initiatives like that yeah

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.800
David are

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.440
you um do you want to say something yeah

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.640
I do want to say something and I'm

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.600
having this strange kind of like outof

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.600
Body Experience between Holly and Kevin

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.839
they're with this kind of I can't tell

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:41.160
which dimension who's in and what's

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.480
going across and the reason I bring this

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.880
up that drawing you can tell right

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.959
because of the it's be listen it's

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:53.600
because you are one of those hyper

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.480
creatives that that um movie

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.920
presentation you put together did the

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.320
same kind of thing Holly and Kevin are

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.040
doing to me it moved me through

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.480
different dimensions and it wasn't what

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.040
was the word matalena just you

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.920
used

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.399
verata no verbera verbera it wasn't

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:22.079
verbera it was this it was this you know

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:26.200
body out of body inbody in time out okay

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.640
I G to ask you a question and put you on

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.320
the spot did the word words

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.839
matter not really right with like we're

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:38.279
not at the point me Alexander barter not

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.399
at the point where the words matter oh

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.720
no I'm talking about the uh the movies

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.920
you did for oh with perspectiva yeah

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.760
sorry those

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.160
words yeah did matter and didn't

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.920
matter because what came back to me was

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.800
the prompt How does the structure of

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.839
time time change and the problem I had

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:06.480
is I kind of move slow in sensing so

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.120
there wasn't much time between movies to

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.519
sense Beyond just the obvious for me I

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:15.639
knew there was more there but um my

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:20.079
point is you're one of the hyper

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.200
creatives thank you for the work you

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.079
do I think the words matter like a

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:33.839
specify one moment for me that was key I

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.839
mean like to me it was a moment of this

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:38.040
be the last comment because I don't

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.079
think other people saw it you okay it

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.639
was a moment of

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.320
metamorphosis I mean literally like

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.600
before my eyes when you took

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.000
methos into lyrical oh my you see it

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.160
fixed because it fixed this

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.399
confusion yes it wasn't a challenge so

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.320
this I'm glad you saw that because this

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.959
is a big deal he's he's gonna change his

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.760
 masculine or patriarchal blah

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.000
blah blah blah and he's gonna say the

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.959
Mythos is not Mythos it's

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.959
lyrical and so it's a big deal for us

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:19.880
because we're gonna be going on next

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.519
year and talk about creating lyrical

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:25.839
culture right yeah oh my God that was so

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:28.040
but it didn't threaten him it was much

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.519
better uh

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.920
helped him understand what he was saying

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.680
see I mean I've been listening to or or

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.199
following I mean I've talked to

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:40.760
Alexander personally whatever um because

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.760
he really has this extraordinarily

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.600
Generous Heart he really does I mean he

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.760
can sound like an and insult

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.120
people and whatever but underneath

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.600
there's just extraordinary generosity

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.399
yeah and and and that's what you

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:03.240
connected with and that that that's what

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.240
was so beautiful because it was a worthy

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.639
interloc yeah seriously so the point

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:11.920
here for the rest of the people is we

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.320
have Alexander who's in this you

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.720
know you know everybody's got their

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.720
performance stick but we've enabled to

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.120
slip in this interesting concept of

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.279
lyric philosophy and lyric culture

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.160
as actually what he's actually been

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.040
looking for um um and that I think was

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.880
important for our our community and

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.440
um yeah

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.480
so so enough of that for now because can

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.680
you define what you mean by lyric

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.680
philosophy and lyric culture okay so no

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.680
not right now because that's basically

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.399
what we're going to do in the early part

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:01.240
of

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.000
2024 um and um I'll be starting to

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.800
writing a seeds essay series on lyric

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.880
culture um lyric culture is just what

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.720
I'm saying is a kind of a cultural

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.480
scene that is founded on lyric

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.759
philosophy and lyric philosophy is

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:27.079
basically uh a word in invented or an

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:30.399
idea kind of composed by janza

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.880
Wiki um

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.680
so uh I'll give one felt sense of it and

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.920
that is it doesn't

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.160
isue it's not allergic

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.199
to um

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:50.199
theoretic philosophy which is you know

00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:53.120
most of the western

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.759
Canon um but it's very interested in

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:59.959
attending to particulars

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:03.320
this particular moment this like these

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.680
Chopsticks I happen to

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.720
think extremely

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.440
nice because it's just handcarved from

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.639
wood so you know you know these these

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.800
noticings are very

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.399
particular so that's part of lyric but

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.519
the word lyric is comes from

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:27.160
musicality and that is if I'm listening

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.639
to a or piece of orchestral

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:34.759
music where is the music is it in the

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:38.160
first note is it in the second note is

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.079
it in the last

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:45.240
note is it in this transitional period

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.360
between two different kind of Acts in a

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.319
in the music is is it in the Overture

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:53.560
where is the

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.560
music and so lyric

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.199
philosophy um is like that so if you

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:02.040
want to know what lyric culture is like

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.920
you've been embedded in it in the pop-up

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.240
school that's why you can't go home and

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.680
tell people what you

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.920
learned it'd be like trying to tell

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.839
people what what what's the music that

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:14.959
you just heard well is it C minor or F

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.800
major or

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.720
G or an A minor chord or a fifth chord

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.959
where's the

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:24.519
music you come home from the Opera or

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.079
you come home from an orchestra like and

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.199
they say okay what what what did you

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:29.160
hear

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.199
how could you possibly tell someone

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.079
where where is where is what you've

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:35.480
heard where is what you've learned and

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.399
so lyric has to do

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.040
with but on the other hand after you

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.839
hear a symphony you have it

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:47.519
all you have it

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.399
all but you've never experienced it all

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.880
or is it on the sheet music where is

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.440
where is where is it lyric philosophy is

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.720
the same way

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.360
it's like music that hangs

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:09.039
Together lyric culture would be the same

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.799
way it's not it's not its purpose is not

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.679
to come to some kind of conclusion at

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:18.000
the

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.039
end or if it does the conclusions

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:25.120
doesn't make any sense the conclusions

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.400
don't make any sense without the journey

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.520
there so that's what lyric philosophy is

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.919
it doesn't matter if it's conceptual or

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.200
poetic I mean Jan Z wikii is a

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.840
conceptual po a conceptual philosopher a

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.240
poet and a musician not surprising that

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.360
she comes up with this term of lyric

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.480
philosophy um so this

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.520
is this is the

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.840
foundational felt sense of lyric

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:06.919
culture can I give my sense of

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.480
what I might think it might mean from

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.000
what you just

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.039
said that was a question oh yeah yeah

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:22.039
um

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.360
so I did this whole reading of this

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.919
person that I studied

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:32.000
and I I had the sense

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.600
of getting the sense of his whole

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.320
Symphony that his work was actually a

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.520
symphony and it took a long time to um

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.280
even any one part of it I could feel oh

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.760
this is part of a symphony but it took a

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.559
long time to be able to hold the whole

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:53.159
of the

00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:55.960
symphony

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.480
uh without having to break it down down

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.799
into its parts and its meaning it took a

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:04.080
long time to be able to hold it without

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.520
having to deconstruct it and so all of

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.240
the nuts and bolts are the parts of the

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.280
symphony are there and necessary and yet

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.919
after a certain point there's a an

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:23.720
experience of the wholeness of uh you

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.600
could even say the posture of it or the

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.120
wholeness of um what it's holding

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.000
and

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.080
and what I

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.440
think what I would make that mean and I

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.640
obviously don't know is

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:45.559
that to be able to engage in lyric

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.600
philosophy you would have to be able to

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.120
hold the wholeness of something the like

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.039
you say where's the music

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:02.480
there's a whole gestal that's have many

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.640
many many

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.400
components and um it feels like it's a

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.000
new level of skill and skill sounds like

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.360
way too small a

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.440
word um you have to have gone through

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.360
the nuts and bolts and nuts and bolts

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.480
and nuts and bolts and nuts and bolts to

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.960
finally uh feel like you

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.159
can um

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.919
trust a larger currency that's moving

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:42.720
trust your ability to to to to sense it

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.840
and to hold it so I just made that up

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.080
but that's my thought about yeah I mean

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.919
there's some things that sound right and

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:52.120
then there's things that I'm not

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.960
sure what you mean

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.159
because one of the things we have to how

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:01.159
do you hold the whole the

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.760
gestal um if you hold it through a

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.159
narrative like you have a narrative and

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.840
you connect all these nodes well that's

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.679
not lyric culture that's just another

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:12.080
strategy through resonance yeah it would

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.679
through resonance to Resonance it yeah

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:18.799
and when you've gone

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.640
to a show an orchestra show I've gone to

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.320
I used to go to a lot of really complex

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.320
Jazz uh shows you come away and there's

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.000
no

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.159
way if you there's a certain is a

00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:38.919
certain eagerness to

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:41.880
to capture what you just experienced and

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.279
there's no way you can capture it

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:46.559
especially these these

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:49.600
improvisational Jazz things we used to

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.360
go to um but your your your self has

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.600
captured it so there's no sense that

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.320
there's an organ that has to do

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.320
something after the

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.120
fact there's no sense that gee did I

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.480
really learn something because I don't

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.000
know what I learned there's a sense

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.159
that with the right so in in in lyric

00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:18.159
culture we're also going to learn about

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:21.520
uh a fan of janza Wiki which is Heidi's

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.360
Warren Heidi's uh attending as a sacred

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.240
art if you attend in the right way then

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.480
you've captured whole and it won't feel

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.000
like it because it's not a narratology

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.159
that connects the dots it's not a

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:38.120
philosophical system that connects the

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.200
dots you just have C you've

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.600
just you've captured it through your

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.840
body through the sensing through the

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.279
being attending in a certain way and and

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.480
that that has changed you

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.760
so so yes exactly what you said as long

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.080
as you're not working really hard after

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.000
the fact to capture either through

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.440
narrative or some kind of systemic

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.520
philosophical system what it is that

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.919
makes it

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:14.600
whole because the capture itself is a

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.559
partiality um now having said that we do

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.600
do that then we go and we talk about

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.600
janza Wiki and we make an narra of I'm

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.159
not I'm not saying that that doesn't

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:25.880
carry forward but your basic experience

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.400
to it is

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.600
it's not that without capturing it it's

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.640
going to somehow evade

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.640
me

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.520
um yeah something like

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.880
that but that's you know that's we're

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.880
talking about culture the origins of

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.679
culture uh we're looking at lyric

00:23:51.679 --> 00:23:56.039
culture as something going

00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:59.480
forward um and lyric culture has a lot

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.480
to do with

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.200
acknowledging

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.440
um

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.200
that you know when you're composing a

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.000
piece of music for

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.720
someone um you're composing for their

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.520
ears but you're also

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.120
composing for their imagination and

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.120
their affective resonance with the with

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.000
the

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.559
music um you're

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.600
speaking you're speaking a lot of

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.799
languages at the same time

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.240
time I'm going to throw something else

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.159
in here which was Herby Hancock gave the

00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:41.720
Norton

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.360
lectures um and for some reason those

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.600
were never

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.960
transcribed and I would like to think he

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.000
said they shouldn't be and they always

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.200
print the Lord Norton lectures so that's

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.960
kind of an interesting except

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.520
exception and in there one of the things

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.039
he talks about was the

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:11.039
relationship with technology of jazz

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:15.640
because Charlie Parker would not travel

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.559
without his um record player and and the

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.600
way he studied

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.039
Jazz was by playing the recordings you

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:32.120
know and starts to scramble this whole

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.200
linear kind of Developmental

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.559
you know it just and and what Harvey

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:41.600
Hancock

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.799
was claiming was that jazz was the

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.840
ethics for the 21st century and I think

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.360
that completely aligns with um Yan fiki

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.399
because look at this one this is another

00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:58.840
little

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.120
fragment I I I

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.200
foraged and I just feel like it's so

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.279
popup schol I mean and you know it's

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:12.919
practice ceaselessly there's one art

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:15.960
wind in the Open Spaces grieving

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.360
laughing with us saying improvise you

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.720
know I

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.120
mean that's not the verbera that's not

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.880
the Dogma or the godma you know I like

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.520
to be dyslexic about that well the other

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.720
thing the katma gogma katma okay it um

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.640
so the other thing about

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.919
um jazz is if you if you're interested

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:47.679
in creating a lyric culture you're like

00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:49.039
oh you know how can you create a culture

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:52.440
out of nothing well the American Jazz

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.480
that whole

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.960
culture um I mean nothing's created out

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.240
of nothing

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.399
but this is an independent culture grown

00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:05.200
homegrown culture in the US in that

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.520
sense they're kind of new indigenous uh

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.960
to the to this to this country um and um

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.240
so how how how does a

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.200
culture an africanamerican or a black

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.240
American culture emerge out of those

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.600
conditions right um and I've always

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.120
complain that like these black lives

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.159
matters and all these things they don't

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.200
emphasize enough the the emergence the

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.120
singular emergence of a culture

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.720
Independence really of past conditions

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.720
and in in Modern Times And um American

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.640
Jazz and all its

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.960
extensions uh into rap and stuff are are

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.960
um should be studied as an AS

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.320
anthropolog logical you know if you want

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.399
to understand how things

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:04.240
emerge uh there's hardly

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.279
anything um more interesting in

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:10.960
studying some of the Pioneers in that

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.200
movement because you're right they they

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200
thought about it a lot they knew about

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.919
what they were doing they're extremely

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:20.559
talented they many of them saw music as

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.519
pure

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:24.679
abstractions uh the way the way Mozart

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:28.880
did and they studied Mozart and B

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.679
so

00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:33.480
uh yeah that's a real inspiration if you

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.720
want to start a new a new

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:49.399
culture um I had an experience over the

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:51.200
summer at jazz I don't know if you want

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.080
to hear a story or if you want to do

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.399
some teaching but

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.399
um

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.120
you know that Chopstick dance you just

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.480
did where's the

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.840
music I went to see a jazz performance a

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.039
live jazz performance at an iconic place

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:15.200
here in Los Angeles the Hollywood Bowl

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200
and the setup

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.600
was about a dozen

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.159
cellos no about a half dozen cellos

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:27.600
about a dozen strings in the back of the

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.440
stage and the front of the stage was 10

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.360
different piano kind of

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.480
instruments that were electronic and

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.200
piano and I mean all different kinds of

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.640
very

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.000
contemporary

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.120
instruments and there was one saxophone

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.320
player

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:02.880
and it was the most

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.360
beautiful assemblage of music and Jazz

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.640
I've ever experienced I've spent my

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.799
whole life I used to sneak into bars

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:14.080
when I was 14 years old here to listen

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.640
to Jazz in Los

00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:21.279
Angeles and I went there thinking I

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:24.240
can't get into this electronic you

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.640
know I

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.240
mean and I'll tell you

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:32.919
you when I look now and see where was

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:36.840
that music I can't tell you it is inside

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.000
of me and it was a

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.880
Transcendent experience for

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.840
me and it was an iconic

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.399
jazz performer Pharaoh Sanders oh my God

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:54.960
what he did about five years

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.440
ago well now seven years ago was he

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.440
hooked up with this electronic

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.840
contemporary group and created composed

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.840
this Symphony and died before the first

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.360
time it was ever performed and I got to

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.399
see it performed by an English Sachs

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:18.840
player that took his spot it

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.120
was just like what you said with those

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.720
did with those Chopsticks where's the

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.799
music it's inside of me

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:30.480
Bonnie so in the 80s when I lived in New

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.919
York and we had an artist L we would go

00:31:32.919 --> 00:31:35.799
see phell Sanders at the new school and

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:37.200
and then these

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.519
overnight uh things and one time I

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:44.279
brought uh my friend who is

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:48.440
gay um he he started Living with this

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.639
German intellectual I think he was a

00:31:50.639 --> 00:31:53.120
medical researcher or something and I

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.360
was like oh let's bring him to see phah

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.519
Sanders and we went to see phah Sanders

00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:01.039
and this German intellectual got so

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:04.120
upset he thought that he thought the

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.600
band was making fun of white people's

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.120
naiv that they were playing because

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.159
they'd go home and like you believe they

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:15.679
they pay for this I can walk right over

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:18.200
there and get my albums of pharoh

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.120
Sanders um yeah so that's the kind of

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.360
jazz we used to listen to I used to go

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.080
and listen to Steve Lacy I remember a

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.200
lot

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.760
and I would get so synesthetic that the

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.840
music was all these these visuals of

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.200
these notes that would change look like

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.480
do that would change color and then do

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.720
this you know of course it was because

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.399
part of it was because so late at night

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.720
and I worked and I was like drinking a

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.799
lot of caffeine and I was at these

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:55.080
concerts and and um being in these these

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.760
dimensional spaces of con Consciousness

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.960
that were

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.480
like um magnificent you know um and and

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.399
I never thought it was a coincidence

00:33:06.399 --> 00:33:08.919
there was some magic that were was

00:33:08.919 --> 00:33:11.279
happening and actually I think Ry and

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:15.679
Marie were in I used to do uh um a

00:33:15.679 --> 00:33:18.799
little workshop on circus Jazz how

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.399
circus Jazz opens the way your mind is

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:24.559
wired

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:27.519
uh in a in a way that

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:30.440
is kind of one of the things meditation

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.039
can help you with

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:36.039
um but yeah phoh Sanders that's That's

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:39.080
Heavy hitting that's that that requires

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.799
a s a very very skillful attending and a

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:46.960
letting go at the same

00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:51.039
time uh I would recommend Carla BL

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:53.279
escalator over the hill you could buy

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.360
the CD set it's an

00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.240
Offa Carla BL b y escalator over the

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.639
hill okay so one of the are there any

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.320
other comments I mean we're just kind of

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.599
this is the fireside chat so far but we

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:34.119
can move

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.720
on I I have just a a thought that's

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.960
coming up

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.839
um this this idea of

00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:54.000
musicality of

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.879
song

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.280
of tiny

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.160
elements weaving into something

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.160
bigger and the sun being

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.160
greater

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.040
um and the idea of

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.160
um transmission that happens through

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.680
song The Sound enters

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.640
us

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.800
um the vibrations do

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.400
and there's this um process of

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.760
entrainment right

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:41.000
where organisms begin to move

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.800
together when they're moving to a shared

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.680
song

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.960
so this is the practice of singing an

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.680
infant to

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.680
comfort while rocking

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.200
it's also sex it's

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.040
also huge groups of people listening to

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.440
music there is this life force of shared

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.000
experience in the

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.560
sounding but it's a

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.119
transmission that's that's

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.720
Mya

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.040
um I just wanted to share a little bit

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.839
about Jan

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:53.200
zinsky and I have a question to ask um I

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.079
had an I had the experience of listening

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:59.680
to her read some of her

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:03.359
poetry and the

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.000
experience I can't

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.839
decide whether I just don't have the

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:13.760
ability to share that experience with

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.119
language or I don't want to it just

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:21.560
doesn't matter and I'm just curious I'm

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.400
sitting with that because that might

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.640
unfold further um

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.079
H and I wonder also if it's a little bit

00:37:31.079 --> 00:37:35.720
relating to one of the allergies or that

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.599
I noticed when I was at University one

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:40.079
of my Majors was

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:42.800
English and I really

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.599
struggled to do this analytical

00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:50.400
unpacking of poetry it's like I lost

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.000
half of it as soon as I did it now or

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.880
all of it or really went into actually

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.119
went into a space that wasn't the poem

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:03.160
actually wasn't really that space once I

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.040
went

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.680
into listening to lectures breaking it

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.839
all down blah blah blah and then trying

00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:12.280
to write something in that way

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.760
myself and I'm wondering is that why I

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.560
don't want to maybe that just occurred

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.280
to me actually maybe that's why I don't

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.720
want to language this or I want to

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.079
language

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:27.000
it why do I need to language it at all

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.119
all cuz I heard Jan say very clearly

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:34.680
that if we're going to use language we

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.640
need to be very exact and that reminded

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.079
me of here a lot where we draw

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:43.400
distinctions so that we are at least on

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.480
the same page but then we see very

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.440
quickly or I saw very quickly this coar

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.119
grained language thing and it

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:58.520
doesn't often help at all

00:39:00.319 --> 00:39:05.119
and for some reason I still want to say

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:08.720
and express this experience of listening

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.240
to her poetry it's cool poetry

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.240
that's very cool anyway that's all I

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.400
have to say at the moment thank

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.640
you yeah in her big book she talks a lot

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.920
about I haven't read it all yet a lot

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.119
about world

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:27.760
wordlessness that the

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.400
philosophers biggest challenge is that

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.240
they're always operating on just just on

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.960
this edge of

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.960
wordlessness

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.640
um so I'm not I'm not trying to make

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.680
janza wikii like our you know leader or

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.040
anything like that

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.960
um just using her

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.440
her method

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.680
really

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.720
um her approach her way has a lot to do

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.200
with what we've been doing and you know

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.480
I only recently discovered

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.480
her um

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.000
and it's nice

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.960
to be able to draw on a body of work

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.680
that's already there to to play with and

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.359
stuff you know

00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:26.920
um

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.280
because For Me lyric lyric culture is

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.560
lyric philosophy plus something like

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.680
waren Heidi's uh

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.640
attending as an art or attending as a

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.760
sacred art

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.440
times David hinton's wild mind wild

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.359
Earth um so those three things together

00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:52.920
to me make lyric lyric

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.880
culture lyric philosophy attending as a

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.599
sacred act

00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:01.200
and um whatever you want to call the

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.920
third one W way

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.680
or being inside the six Extinction event

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.160
something and I would say that that

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.440
that's lyric

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.440
culture

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.400
um and you know that's how 20124 is set

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.560
out if you if you go to the Retreats but

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.839
also um the posts and the

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:29.760
the reflections and the briefs will be

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.280
based upon Warren hi h

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.480
i I don't know how to say his last

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.920
name I can find it really

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.800
fast it's also

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.040
um as a

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.560
art um no that's not

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.200
good it's also listed on the rich

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.319
Retreat website as the resource for the

00:41:58.319 --> 00:42:00.720
second

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.079
Retreat yeah I wanted to ask sort of

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:20.160
about like bringing it sort of back to

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.680
egregor yeah let's do that yeah because

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.680
we're talking about music and Harmony

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.119
but sometimes times things are not super

00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:30.720
harmonious and the music isn't so great

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.760
like I remember um chanting one time in

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.559
this Temple and there was this one woman

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:39.760
who just chanted so loud like so so loud

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.520
that you no one else could hear like and

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.599
sort of threw everyone off because and

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:48.359
you know she wasn't aware of it um but

00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:51.240
just sort of you know how to shift or

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.760
how to respond when the music is

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.800
someone's maybe toned deaf or like it's

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.240
not moving in a harmonious

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.640
Direction so what's interesting what zi

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.160
does in her big book is she has her two

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.960
big books is she has something on the

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.400
left hand side that she writes that

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.960
sounds like her and then something on

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.480
the right- hand side which is analytic

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.559
philosophy and she challenges the reader

00:43:17.559 --> 00:43:19.720
to say how do these two

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.240
things go

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.960
together

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.599
um and it's not easy

00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:28.440
I mean I pride myself on someone who

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.559
could answer these puzzles and I'm like

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:33.440
what you know like so it's not like

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.359
she's she's trying to

00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:42.520
be utopian or Kumbaya person

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.240
um but the notion of the agore if we're

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.920
going to move on to that is really

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.800
fascinating

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.559
because

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:55.079
um when we look at the origins of

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.079
culture

00:43:57.079 --> 00:44:00.079
and when we think about new culture

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:04.480
emerging cultures or or new unfolding

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.119
cultures we think of culture as creating

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:14.040
a wi space right so like um people

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.240
understand themselves as a people as the

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.680
Jewish people or as Irish people um um

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.040
and early on before the modern era those

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.280
were not related to States they were

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.359
related to ancestry right so culture has

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:33.160
to do with creating these larger and

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.800
larger units of

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.800
identity

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:45.599
um creating a we space and a we

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.640
space um depending on you how you

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.000
describe it but for me what a we is as

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.200
opposed to an us so an us is like a

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.079
category us

00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:00.640
Americans you know we're we go off in

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.440
all different directions but a we is

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.839
like a team we

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:14.920
won the game right um but um and some

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.559
people will say you know we Americans we

00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:20.880
won the war I don't experience that as

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.520
like we won the War I experience as like

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.520
us Americans won the war yet again or us

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.960
Americans started the war right so for

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:34.359
me we has this capacity to be a unit of

00:45:35.319 --> 00:45:37.760
action and this is kind of the Holy

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.520
Grail of these practices how do you

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.240
create a culture where people are

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.040
coherent or resonant enough that they

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.000
can act

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.520
collaboratively at scales that can

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.240
change the

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.359
system

00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:57.319
right so um this is a question for a lot

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:00.680
of people and if you've tried to do

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.800
alternative things you find that you

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.000
even acting at a scale of five or six

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
people is really hard it's really hard

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.440
to make so Jonathan ralson calls it the

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.760
impossible

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.480
we like how many how much effort's gone

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.800
into like the emerge and the de in

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.440
development people and all these efforts

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.119
to and gain be and blah blah blah all

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:30.559
these efforts to create a we and by we I

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:32.720
mean is not an us not just people that

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.839
identify with game be it's an us I'm a

00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:39.280
card carrying game be or

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.720
whatever um

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.559
but the kind of glue that makes it a

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:47.200
unit of

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.200
action so this is this is something

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.960
people have been experimenting with and

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.200
working on for a long time you might

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.280
find it hard to make your own family a

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.280
unit of action these days one's a

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.160
Republicans some are Democrats this one

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.559
marries a financial person and and you

00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:07.839
can't you can't act together

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.839
anymore but having said that on the

00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:15.599
global scale we are a huge unit of

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.760
action we

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.920
we extract resources we have these

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.640
Global Supply chains we have these

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.079
Global uh geopolitical systems and we do

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:31.800
this without any effort we become this

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.520
huge Wei if you're you know if you're

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.040
like another animal and you're looking

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.000
at the human species they're like a

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.520
we're like a swarm of ants that is

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.559
really really really coordinated and

00:47:43.559 --> 00:47:46.760
active and powerful and

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.960
destructive we are without trying a huge

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.760
we it's just not the we anyone wants to

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.280
be or do we want to be this is the big

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.760
conundrum of all these experiments

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.400
everyone's trying to become a we and not

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.440
realizing that should how we need to

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.720
understand that we are a we and it's so

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.599
Insidious we don't even have to try to

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:12.440
be a wee we can even try not to be a we

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.359
and we're part of that unit of action so

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.160
if you're interested in creating wi

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.280
spaces you have to come to terms with

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.680
this

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.640
paradox

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.839
I have a question for you because of

00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:38.960
your

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.520
dogs

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.200
um yeah um so a friend of mine who lives

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.200
on a penthouse but there's no

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.960
elevator um has this huge great thing

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.880
that has decided that's it I'm not going

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.599
up those stairs

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.799
and so Lucy that's her name she's

00:49:01.799 --> 00:49:06.040
staying with me now so he's got this 200

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.559
square meter Penthouse I've got this

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:11.559
little Studio but the only place in the

00:49:11.559 --> 00:49:14.280
village where this dog could be is in my

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.440
studio so there's been this really

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.640
interesting kind of thing happening

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.680
right and um in contemplating Lucy who's

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.920
had the grace to accept

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.599
me you know like we get that this is

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:36.640
where she can live right

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.799
now um it struck me how all dogs came

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:42.880
from

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.119
wolves and I remember this Bruno tour

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:49.359
lecture where he put this slide of like

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:52.880
what we've done to dogs for the sake of

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.079
having a domestic companion

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:59.480
we've bred all these kinds of

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.280
weirdnesses and and this great dane you

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.040
know her back legs are you know inbred

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.119
anomaly that's why it's not only her

00:50:10.119 --> 00:50:12.640
back legs their hearts are too small so

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.640
their back legs give out first yeah

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.400
exactly so it just struck me that you

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.160
know without talking about any moral

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.440
judgments just the fact that we've

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.559
manipulated a wolf's jeans to this

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:32.000
extent from the chaha to the Great

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.960
Dane it it just kind of creeped me out

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.520
you know that I mean how much effort how

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.839
much experimentation has gone into all

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:46.240
this inbreeding for the

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.240
sake of having a

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.520
pet and I mean it was an outrage I

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.359
hadn't really felt before at our own

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:02.640
species you know and our I mean of

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.400
course we do that with tomatoes and

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.960
chickens and pigs and everything

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.480
else people but you know these dogs just

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.520
give you like this crazy ass loyalty you

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.119
know

00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:24.359
um that we can't seem to muster you know

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:27.599
disloyalty without submission I mean

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.119
that's how I feel

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:33.359
it and oh she said something when I said

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.599
that

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.760
um you know and and I'm also being

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.000
initiated into like pallative care

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.160
because her back legs it's so hard for

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.319
her to get up that she poops a little

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:51.480
bit when she gets up you know and of

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.520
course I'm just in the studio so I can

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.880
smell it and then I'm growing through

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.000
this whole thing in my head saying I'm

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.839
just conditioned to think that this is a

00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:04.559
bad smell stop it you know just get up

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:07.480
deal with it you know and and and it's

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.880
like this whole dispositionality is

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.680
being tested oh my God like you know

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:20.000
into like put putri action okay and and

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.079
I like it I mean I like the challenge

00:52:23.079 --> 00:52:26.040
you know like it feels right for the

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.040
time to be tested at that level and I

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.599
guess that's kind of what I'm um

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:40.839
embracing honestly in the adventure of

00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:43.200
dispositionality not as some kind of

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.599
formula but as an adventure I mean how

00:52:46.599 --> 00:52:50.720
far can you take this in this

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.319
deconditioning of what's acceptable

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:56.480
what's not great thing to run

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.200
experiments like this like you both

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.720
realize it's not the whole but it's a

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.119
very very interesting Adventure or

00:53:04.119 --> 00:53:08.480
experiment to run you learn a lot

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:14.119
from these experiments that

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.880
that yeah my whole life is kind of like

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.079
one of those weird that kind of

00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:27.160
experiment um

00:53:30.839 --> 00:53:33.480
now do you think that could catch on as

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.720
an

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.119
egregor well okay this is the question

00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:40.640
what is what makes an EG what makes it a

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.079
catch on what are the components that

00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:46.960
make people move at

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.720
scale and I mean we talked about them

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.640
last time there were the four

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.200
components and what you realize if you

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.839
can if you can

00:53:58.839 --> 00:54:02.119
infect all you know if you can if you

00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:06.160
can be effective in all four

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.040
components

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.839
um then you

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.520
can then the system will run itself

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.640
right so this reminds me of something

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.680
when I first met Nora Bates and she had

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.079
this theory of of change or

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:27.359
whatever and the where she she got a

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:30.079
grant to run the theory in a mental

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:31.520
institution where they worked with

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.200
addicts because she's like what makes

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.319
people addicted like if you get people

00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:38.880
addicted to the right thing you know or

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.839
it's kind of like asking that question

00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:43.079
what makes

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:46.480
us able to coordinate at such a large

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.599
global

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:50.440
scale um

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.720
and and figure out that and but use it

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.839
to different a different purpose you

00:54:56.839 --> 00:54:59.440
know the the pro problem is does it only

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.880
work if you're destructive and then if

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.119
you want to uh have a culture that

00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:09.400
creates more life it doesn't work like

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.839
is that is that the case I mean I don't

00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:15.119
know it's it's an interesting

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:17.200
question but I think we have to come to

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.640
the fact that without effort were this

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.160
huge powerful unit on the face of the

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.359
Earth and we and

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.200
and it's there to tell us like like what

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.680
are the components of being a huge

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.799
powerful we on the

00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:40.880
earth um instead of only thinking like

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.520
we're try you know we have to have all

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.599
these ex exotic psycho Technologies to

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:50.280
become a Wei we need to learn what is

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.400
what is already this huge powerful thing

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.480
that makes us this huge powerful

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.559
we and somehow reproduce that to

00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:02.960
different

00:56:12.079 --> 00:56:14.520
purpose I mean some people would answer

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.400
that in a very easy way it's because

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.760
people are greedy so if you design this

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.799
thing around greed then people become a

00:56:21.799 --> 00:56:23.640
huge powerful

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.160
weat um is that the answer I don't think

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.599
so um yeah but what what is greediness

00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:34.200
though exactly then that then you would

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.760
you would want to look at that like why

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.280
is so but some people would say that you

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.359
know some people would say but

00:56:45.799 --> 00:56:49.799
but yeah but for example white head has

00:56:49.799 --> 00:56:51.920
this great I'm not going to say it right

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.960
but it's something like uh it's in the

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.680
adventure of ideas that that peace can

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.400
be

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.039
easily

00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:04.720
um

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.920
perverted by its

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.520
aberation which is

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.880
anesthesia and I think consumerism was a

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.319
form of collective

00:57:18.319 --> 00:57:23.400
anesthesia coming out of the you know

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.880
knowing that we were capable

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.079
of Exterminating ourselves after the

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:33.200
atomic bomb as a collective unconscious

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.839
I mean I think we give ourselves too

00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:39.839
much of an illusion of individual agency

00:57:39.839 --> 00:57:43.240
you know that we are in an agregar all

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.480
the time I

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.039
mean and that we've created this myth of

00:57:51.039 --> 00:57:52.400
um the

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.920
individual and that's sort of of what

00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.319
anesthetizes us from I mean what's that

00:58:00.319 --> 00:58:04.640
fungus that falls on an ant and takes

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.359
over its

00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:10.839
neural um thing and makes

00:58:10.839 --> 00:58:15.599
it shortcuts their pro-social thing and

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:18.280
makes the ant just gather more food to

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.119
feed the fungus until the fungus like

00:58:20.119 --> 00:58:23.720
breaks through its head

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.000
um I forget the name of it but it's very

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.680
curious

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.760
thing and I I I feel

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.440
like it's been this erroneous

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.960
exceptionalism about the human that

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.359
somehow is created in the image of a God

00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:43.680
and therefore not part of everything

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.839
else and and so we don't even we can't

00:58:47.839 --> 00:58:51.400
onto epically conceive of ourselves as

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.720
as being parasitical as being you know

00:58:56.799 --> 00:59:01.280
um not the captains of our soul you know

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.400
whatever that is um and I think that

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.280
with this connectivity with this melan

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.200
age we have an opportunity to actually

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.039
see that I mean I'm sure you know him

00:59:15.039 --> 00:59:17.559
Bonita Patrick Ryan you know because he

00:59:17.559 --> 00:59:20.240
shows up at the sto yeah you know what I

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.440
was wondering I'm looking at Marie and r

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.920
ray I'm wondering if the Italians have

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.520
concept of the

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.000
aggregor like do they worry about the

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.319
egregor ask about their concept of

00:59:48.119 --> 00:59:50.319
pizza I don't

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:53.640
know I don't know are we

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.720
there we

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.720
there

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:03.599
yeah yeah I don't I don't

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:07.799
know I don't know I I know that they

01:00:07.799 --> 01:00:10.520
that I

01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:15.000
experience um at least the Italians that

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.920
I'm around I experience them as a very

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.400
very different group that moves together

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.359
than I

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:26.320
do with people that I hang out with back

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.440
[Music]

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.079
home the culture has a different way of

01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:33.799
moving around I don't think anybody can

01:00:33.799 --> 01:00:34.920
hear

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.520
us are we Frozen no we can hear you

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.359
frozen you said the culture moves around

01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:44.559
differently oh

01:00:44.559 --> 01:00:47.200
okay yeah they move they're they're in

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.680
relationship with with one another

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.079
different sorry about that this is a

01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:56.240
makeshift thing here

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.119
there yeah it's it's I don't you guys

01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:01.640
get deported and you're in like a cell

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640
now or

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.119
something the Italians put you in some

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:09.000
kind of detention center

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.599
did correct well it it actually might be

01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:15.039
worth telling um

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:21.520
Sandy Sandy said it um we're on a pizza

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
pilgrimage um we're we're in a place

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.039
called

01:01:26.039 --> 01:01:30.680
Kazo and uh there's a guy here that's a

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.760
third

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.400
generation

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.039
pizza maker and he broke off from the

01:01:37.039 --> 01:01:41.520
family because he decided that pizza

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.280
didn't have to be like a peasant food

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.359
and he wanted to make it something else

01:01:47.359 --> 01:01:51.039
and so he just kept experimenting and he

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:55.319
spent 12 years experimenting and it it

01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:58.640
cost him his marriage it cost him his

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.680
family broke off from his brothers

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.720
everything and and he's created

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.599
something and so uh we came here we got

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:12.480
off on the train this is um we're not

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:17.319
near anything but um like you yeah it's

01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:20.240
an old village on a hill and you get off

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.480
the train and and and you just like

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.000
follow the people they're all coming

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.599
here for the pizza and it's like this I

01:02:28.599 --> 01:02:32.559
I I mean this one guy has

01:02:32.559 --> 01:02:37.480
revitalized this this Village this town

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.960
that has gained this International

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.799
reputation

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:45.680
for pizza and and and it's it's a

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.680
medieval town it's yeah medieval town on

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.000
a hill and he he's

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.720
engaged um you guys are all all the

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.960
local farmers

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.640
yeah for us you're you're you're Frozen

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.319
no no you're good you're good has a very

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.520
smile on her face you're

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.599
good um anyway so so yeah just like I

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:11.640
mean it's been it's it it it's very

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.440
provocative in thinking about this

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.480
experience in relationship to trying to

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.839
like make change happen in the world

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:24.799
like he wasn't trying to create in the

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:28.119
Middle East or do any Grand Endeavor he

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:31.880
just loved pizza and and he's like

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.359
there's airbnbs all over this town and

01:03:36.359 --> 01:03:40.680
um he sources all the the ingredients

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:45.319
for his pizzas from local farmers and

01:03:45.319 --> 01:03:49.200
and it just has so many Ripple effects

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.319
from this simple thing and it's it's

01:03:52.319 --> 01:03:54.799
incredibly elegant at the same time

01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:58.720
it's very elegant so yeah

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.319
that's so I would say this is lyric

01:04:01.319 --> 01:04:03.680
culture because it's you you become

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.520
obsessed with the particular you know

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.920
what is the particular and you just you

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.799
just it's not about the global or the

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:16.920
the it it's it's these pockets of

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:22.240
particularity and um

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.760
um which answers to me answers the

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.839
egregor question it's it's the pursuit

01:04:28.839 --> 01:04:33.839
of of culture at scale is a distortion

01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:36.440
it it is what turns culture into

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.200
evil this we've been at it for you know

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.680
15,000 years culture only moves into

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.200
larger fewer and fewer types and larger

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.240
and larger scale and at a certain point

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.240
it's an the inflection point it culture

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.720
becomes uh

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.680
renic um so if you had more people you

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.319
know so here he's he if you have more

01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:05.319
people following

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:08.039
peculiarities you would have a different

01:05:08.039 --> 01:05:10.680
type of

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.119
relationship you would have individuals

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:15.839
that were connected by their

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:18.960
unique um gifts

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.720
versus by these

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.640
massive uh means by which people just do

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.319
what they're

01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:29.799
told it's it's palpable it was it's

01:05:29.799 --> 01:05:32.680
really inspiring to sort of Step into

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.960
the Ambiance of all

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:38.920
that it's the same with that film

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.160
100,000 beating Hearts the guy started

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.520
to farm differently now he's on Twitter

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.240
and he's on the TV was on Joe Rogan they

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.279
have a whole Community it's white white

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:51.520
out pastures and they've gone on to do

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.799
all kinds of things by one person's

01:05:55.799 --> 01:05:59.480
decision obl obligatory

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:04.359
vow um and I think that this is

01:06:04.359 --> 01:06:06.160
the the

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.119
Paradox because everybody's trying to

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.720
run culture

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.799
through rules of

01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:16.799
scale

01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:19.960
and um this just

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.720
reproduces Mass

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.200
Consciousness which becomes destructive

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.279
because it can be colonized by

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.000
power is there a way

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.559
that some I don't even know what to say

01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:46.480
group can create you know at huge scale

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.079
a

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:52.000
real embracing of true

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.039
diversity you see the the challenge here

01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:59.359
or The Leverage is not in trying to

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:02.039
create something else another Goliath at

01:07:02.039 --> 01:07:04.640
scale that can fight the Goliath that's

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.559
there it's this people to stop paying

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:11.200
attention to being part of what is what

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.279
scales and to spend their all their life

01:07:14.279 --> 01:07:18.119
in voluntary obligation to something in

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:21.279
particular spend all your life gardening

01:07:21.279 --> 01:07:23.319
and get a little job on the side if you

01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:24.680
have to

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.359
and then you don't you don't contribute

01:07:26.359 --> 01:07:30.599
to the thing but all the Consciousness

01:07:30.599 --> 01:07:32.880
even among young people want to change

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.760
the system is all let's build another

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.799
big system and what I'm saying it's a

01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:40.680
convivial tool is that that culture at

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.520
scale is

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.279
evil because to become culture at scale

01:07:47.279 --> 01:07:49.319
you have to swallow other cultures and

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:52.920
then mass mass condition

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.920
them

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:01.520
that cultures flourish when they they

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.480
they're allowed to diverse and divest

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.119
into their

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.839
particulars

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.120
and what are there there's only 200

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.040
Nations and everybody speaks English you

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.480
know there's like there's no there's no

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.319
cultures left there's just this big a

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.000
glutenous

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.799
mass

01:08:59.159 --> 01:09:02.319
there are some cultures

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.359
left yes and I think there's a lot of

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:08.679
little emerging ones yeah yeah and

01:09:08.679 --> 01:09:12.040
there's ones that very often weaving

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.719
back into what we were talking about

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:19.759
before with the music um language is a

01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:20.600
type

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.120
of music it's a type of in

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.279
rment

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:31.400
um and I loved I loved what was said

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.560
about how you can notice how the Italian

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.279
culture sort of moves differently yes

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:43.799
and there is like a

01:09:43.799 --> 01:09:46.560
um there's a

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.640
body uh patterning movement patterning

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.480
to

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.920
culture um and some of that can be seen

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.320
in you know stereotypes that people make

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.880
but it's also kind of

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.640
a way way that people come to relate and

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.880
communicate on a body level

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.239
um yeah I'm I'm heading to Argentina to

01:10:13.239 --> 01:10:14.440
study the

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.600
tango and um I'm really excited to do

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.640
that because it's um it's really

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640
uh

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.360
a folk

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360
dance that

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.679
originated in multip in a multiplicity

01:10:32.679 --> 01:10:33.679
of

01:10:33.679 --> 01:10:36.159
diversity and there was a way of

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:38.080
relating to one another that crossed

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.239
language REM movement especially for

01:10:41.239 --> 01:10:45.159
people who had left family and felt

01:10:45.159 --> 01:10:46.679
lonely

01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:50.719
um and at it at its core is the embrace

01:10:50.719 --> 01:10:51.880
the the

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.199
hug um

01:10:54.199 --> 01:10:57.120
which hearkens back once again

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.000
to being held by by a caregiver at the

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.040
very beginning heart tohe heart

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:06.760
soed to be ENT trained in that culture

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.920
yeah no this is a big Insight because if

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.320
you think

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.960
about um if you think about a lot of

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.600
them some of the Mediterranean

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.080
cultures um some of the a lot of the

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.880
resistance that comes from like France

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.520
Italy Greece is that the people

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.360
literally refuse to move a certain way

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.960
like you know if you're like a big Tech

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.840
startup and stuff you want to see people

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.320
moving right and it's like it's like

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.760
just their

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.000
physical drag from this mod you know

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.040
you're like they they're so slow Manana

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.840
like this whole this whole thing is very

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.960
politically very very positive you know

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.040
resistance just the refusal to move your

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.600
body in a certain way is very powerful

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.840
resistance I mean anyone that's been

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.520
trying to teach high school kids and

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.719
then you know come on we gotta go here

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:09.280
and then they just their bodies just

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.880
they just don't robera is laughing do

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.920
you know but this is this is you know

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.480
then of course it gets the activist

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.440
going they won't they just lay down and

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.440
stuff like this but in the everyday life

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.480
this a very powerful if you learn to

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.960
move differently if you learn to move

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.520
your body in different ways this becomes

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.159
an act of resistance just naturally I

01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:36.120
would say that that is a

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.600
big a big part of cultural change is

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.639
exactly what what you just said um it's

01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:45.400
not trivial it's

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.400
fundamental

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.600
um

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.440
yeah

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.199
are you saying we should get out of our

01:13:08.199 --> 01:13:11.880
chairs when you start your

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.360
playlist I don't know what I'm

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.360
saying

01:13:50.199 --> 01:13:52.159
but the concept of Igor is really

01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:55.639
interesting and and how has

01:13:57.159 --> 01:14:00.400
to be

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.280
understood

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.120
just um going going back to um how when

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.320
systems become too large they

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.000
lose some of the

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.920
essence um

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.880
I'm I've observed I've been practicing

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.480
Tango for a while and um it's very it's

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.400
wonderful there are a lot of beautiful

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.880
great things about it

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.760
it um and it also has moved away from

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.639
its Essence which add its Essence was a

01:15:01.639 --> 01:15:02.679
community

01:15:02.679 --> 01:15:05.040
dance where children danced with aunts

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.760
and uncles and

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.840
grandparents it wasn't just about being

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.719
sexy even though it's great to be sexy

01:15:11.719 --> 01:15:16.040
but it was about Community Connection

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.719
and a witness a circle of

01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:22.199
witnesses holding space for the

01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:25.520
interpersonal connection of the

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.080
community you know similar to break

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.360
dancing at its roots and now of course

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.520
ex captured yeah this that's right the

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.320
scene and the youth and the development

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.480
of it um and the

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.800
performance um yeah

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.800
um these are all things to look at in

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.360
terms of

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.320
like how things natur

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.400
emerge um we can learn from them they're

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.600
still in the human

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.480
system

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.960
and I think trying

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.040
to I mean I think it odd psycho

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.719
Technologies are important you can learn

01:16:09.719 --> 01:16:14.840
a lot from them but I think they

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.679
they I think they're too Fringe I think

01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:23.520
there's an answer right in the the heart

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.800
of who we are as humans right in the

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.719
heart of what culture is and how it has

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.960
and always has sustained

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.000
itself

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.920
um and a lot of the psycho Technologies

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.480
I think are to break the old habits you

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.080
know but I don't think they're

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.800
necessarily

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.920
templates this is something I an illich

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.360
would say you know most of religion now

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.600
should be people eating around the table

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.040
friends you know uh and

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.040
so

01:17:02.679 --> 01:17:05.040
um I mean that's this is the

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.000
conversation we're having today like

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.560
there's there's something

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:12.199
in our default mode that's actually very

01:17:12.199 --> 01:17:18.920
valuable that can help us um and

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.080
um yeah that's why I love what Marie and

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.199
and Ry said like something as how could

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:31.400
something as transformative as

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.280
pizza or you

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.560
know there are kiosks in parts of the

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.360
city that are like that they've been

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.040
around um I'm not sure in America but

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.280
there's some in in

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.239
Japan that have been around for six or

01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:53.660
seven

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.480
[Music]

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.400
generations and people get married on

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.440
the street around these kiosks

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.000
and something like that's very very

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.440
important to study

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.679
also that you know these aren't Fringe

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:17.679
things these are Timeless kinds of kind

01:18:17.679 --> 01:18:20.280
of things that then when you try to do

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.800
them again they look Fringe right

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.320
because it's like who does that anymore

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.480
right so that they can look bizarre when

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.760
they're resurrected inside Modern Life

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.040
but these are interesting questions

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.159
about the human

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.239
condition and anyways lyric

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:45.280
culture she she she talks a lot about

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.280
Domesticity in this way has a it can

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.760
feel like a

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.920
throwback

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.920
um

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.080
the solution can feel so trivial and so

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.080
simple that you're almost too

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.120
embarrassed to suggest it like you know

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.840
like I want to revolutionize pizza or

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.440
whatever and then you find that the

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.199
certain kind of energy can draw in can

01:19:13.199 --> 01:19:15.560
transform an Old Village you know and

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.600
can remake society

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.600
and

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.320
yeah but I agree with you there's a lot

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.000
of that kind of stuff happening not

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.639
everyone not every initiative gets

01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:32.800
viral on YouTube and then gets like a

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.000
bunch of airbnbs around it but I think

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.480
that having a strong Center could be an

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.920
educational thing it could be a a farm

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.080
thing it could be a dance Community um

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.920
as a center um and then operate along

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.159
some of these convivial ways of being

01:19:55.159 --> 01:19:58.120
these trust networks and yeah building

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.560
it out from there I think this these

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.120
things are

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.760
possible

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.560
Bonnie I thought I saw catala raise her

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.159
hand maybe it was

01:20:40.199 --> 01:20:43.679
inadvertent you may be

01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:54.719
oppression

01:21:38.239 --> 01:21:39.800
you know one of the things that is

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.520
common with if you think of the

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.480
Jazz culture as it emerges or this pizza

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.800
culture

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.960
um they're they're certainly not

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.600
established

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.520
on the premise to make money I mean over

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.000
time they become you know co-opted in

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
big deals and stuff but

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.840
um people just make sacri they they're

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.400
just so in love with the pursuit of

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.080
something um and as you guys said and if

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.600
you take a really hard right turn into

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.679
being

01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:18.960
that in love with a pursuit of something

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.199
then you like JK Rollins you know you

01:22:22.199 --> 01:22:24.560
get really poor and you your

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.920
relationships suffer all these all these

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.600
standard ways of being actually stuer

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.800
suffer and

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.560
um

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.159
there's a lot of Secrets too you're

01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:10.159
never gonna find out how he makes his

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:13.679
pizza I hope you realize

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.480
this

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.159
yeah that's actually that's really

01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:30.520
interesting I've been working at Joe for

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.199
a couple of years now and I've learned a

01:23:32.199 --> 01:23:35.520
little bit and then eating this eating

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.719
this guy's food I realized that there's

01:23:37.719 --> 01:23:41.360
no way not only can I learn it I don't

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.840
want to learn

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.159
it it's like I don't want to own

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:49.360
that it it was such a gift to be on the

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.480
receiving end of

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.480
it

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.159
and a lot of those what's in common with

01:24:01.159 --> 01:24:03.120
a lot of these things is you know bread

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.120
is complex because it it's if it's yeast

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.960
based it's a it's alive I mean you're

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.600
working with a living

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.199
system and these people they they wine

01:24:15.199 --> 01:24:19.840
is the same way they relate to the life

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.360
force of the

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.360
thing

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.719
which is subject to responsiveness to

01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:31.320
the environment you know and and the way

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.080
you move your hands and on and on and on

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.040
and

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.040
on

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.880
um

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.360
yeah

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.440
you hear that dog crying in the

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.719
background oh

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.920
good he's on the porch and he wants to

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.760
go in the house and Sandy can't hear him

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:30.040
so he sounds like he sounds like this is

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.719
poor abused animal outside my

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.880
window Bonnie are you back in your

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.360
studio

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.360
yes yes I have a whole new setup so

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.159
we're gonna have some fun things I'm

01:25:47.159 --> 01:25:51.520
trying to set it up so we can have like

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.719
a half it won't be here it'll be over

01:25:53.719 --> 01:25:55.600
there and there'll be like because I

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.239
have all these visitors coming in

01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:59.520
November and that we could have some

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.239
sessions where we stream live to the

01:26:03.239 --> 01:26:04.440
popup

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.199
school um so you I can't do it now

01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:08.639
because I'm not sure to do it but this

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:12.639
camera can go whyde can you know have

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:14.440
see around I'm trying to make a little

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:20.119
schedule huh so so

01:26:20.119 --> 01:26:24.440
um yeah that's trying to set it up um it

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.679
was very frustrating trying to set up

01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:29.880
this station because it's it's powered

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.840
by a Microsoft Surface Pro which is a

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.440
pretty good

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.440
processor um but it's old generation so

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.600
all the the hookups and the ports are

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.679
different I mean it was just crazy

01:26:43.679 --> 01:26:46.840
how how how many things I bought that

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.639
were wrong which is fine you just send

01:26:48.639 --> 01:26:52.920
them back but um I'm still um in need of

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.520
one other cable and one other external

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.760
speaker um but I've been trying to set

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.199
it up

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.520
so um we can have live stream events

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.159
from here uh for the popup

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.920
school so we do have quite a few

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.639
visitors coming in November

01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:24.119
um

01:27:34.679 --> 01:27:36.560
it's all right I'd like to Loop all the

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.400
way back to something that came up when

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.280
Melina was talking about Lucy the great

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.679
danne and mentioned that you know in

01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:49.360
addition to dogs you know humans have

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.000
bred chickens and tomatoes and and you

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.440
popped in with humans and I was just

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.480
curious if you would elaborate on what

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.960
you

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.679
meant um well I think what we are

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:06.440
talking about is kind of

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.760
making distorting the

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.040
natural the Natural Evolution of

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.360
animals um uh selectively distorting

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.800
well we can I can go from more concrete

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.800
to more abstract so for example um what

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.520
when you wage war on an indigenous

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.360
population you get rid of all the uh

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.560
most powerful men

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.960
first and you end up with a passive

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.520
population the opposite is happening in

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.080
Palestine because what's happening in

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.199
Palestine is you're selecting for

01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:52.760
radicalized population

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.239
because early on the the peaceful people

01:28:55.239 --> 01:28:58.159
leave and over time the population gets

01:28:58.159 --> 01:29:00.040
more

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.199
radicalized it's just it's just a law of

01:29:04.199 --> 01:29:07.800
nature um so there's a lot of policies

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:12.000
uh on a a geopolitical scale that

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.400
um selectively breed there's a famous

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:21.159
study in London about um this this about

01:29:21.159 --> 01:29:22.679
bringing in

01:29:22.679 --> 01:29:25.679
immigrants and if you have immigrants

01:29:25.679 --> 01:29:29.760
and and they don't they don't um

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.480
integrate well in the neighborhood the

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.840
worst thing you can do is put up a wall

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.480
if you put up a wall the the

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.600
neighborhoods become more violent they

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.400
they become more violent to each other

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.159
so there's there's there's a lot of uh

01:29:45.159 --> 01:29:47.320
the prison population in the US is a

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.400
selective breeding

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.239
program uh Reagan's war on drug drugs

01:29:52.239 --> 01:29:54.719
was a selective breeding

01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:57.840
program um basically to have more and

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.480
more pacified um pacified citizenship uh

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.239
China's very good at selective breeding

01:30:07.239 --> 01:30:08.960
uh programs better than the us because

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.480
they have much more of a centralized

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.040
government and we have Texas you know

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:16.000
Texas is like they're crazy

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.840
right um

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.520
so

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.600
um um so the Distortion so we so this

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.440
distinction between the nature of mind

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.440
and the kinds of Minds we have have so

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.199
we have the nature of our minds is human

01:30:33.199 --> 01:30:35.400
mind but the kinds of Minds we have

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.880
today has been selectively B bred into

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.760
us

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.840
um so

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:49.280
um

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.840
yeah

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.440
the kinds of diets we have

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.920
today hormone you know hormones and the

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.800
all this stuff um like what a big big

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.760
selective breeding program on the west

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:16.560
is um the um obesity and diab diabetes

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.600
problem it's not natural no one

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.440
understands it people there's if it's

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.960
not because it's you know there's so

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.199
many correlations and there's this huge

01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:36.040
huge multi-year huge Cross Research

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.119
metaanalysis um that's very important

01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:42.320
because get

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.520
this the wild animals are getting fatter

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.000
too so first they noticed the animals in

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.360
the zoos and they were like okay

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.520
processed food blah blah blah the wild

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.000
animals are getting fatter

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.920
too so this

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.239
metaanalysis the two top things they

01:31:59.239 --> 01:32:03.520
think is um obesity in animal

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.000
populations and humans is always

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.080
associated with lower latitudes

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.960
altitudes and the and the lower

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.880
watersheds there's so many

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.840
anti-depressants in in in the water and

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.480
steroids in the water so people that

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.520
have go on

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.880
anti-depressants get fat people who take

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.320
steroids get fat animal farm animal

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.760
steroids that's why they give farm

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.960
animal steroids and antibiotics because

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.119
it produces weight so the problem the

01:32:37.119 --> 01:32:39.600
epidemic is because in the Watershed is

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.560
what they believe now so you go on and

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.679
on and on about public policy and you

01:32:44.679 --> 01:32:46.679
got the diet pills and you got the fight

01:32:46.679 --> 01:32:48.360
the people who are arguing againsts and

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.080
then youve got the African-Americans

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.800
that happen to be in the low water shed

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.320
you got all this

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:56.560
 and it's not any of those things

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.480
it's a very very multi-dimensional

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:04.159
complex problem that is environmental at

01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:07.119
scale so that's selective breeding the

01:33:07.119 --> 01:33:09.719
the the the culture selectively breeds

01:33:09.719 --> 01:33:12.600
for obese

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.199
diabetic people like a sharpi like

01:33:16.199 --> 01:33:18.800
Sharpes you know they have really bad

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.639
they're a kind of a dog and they have

01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:22.480
really bad skin problem because they

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.080
have like folds and folds and folds of

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:30.600
skin and pugs can't breathe and they

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.719
can't have

01:33:31.719 --> 01:33:34.360
children because because they're so

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.400
deformed so these are these are with

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.040
animals uh we breed for you know the

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.400
same way we build these

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.280
architectures that are buildings that

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.080
are not alive they're

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.760
anti-life um

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.880
these things are are not in service to

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.400
life

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.400
they're

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.560
yeah so one thing I've added to my

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.080
dispositionality

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.679
Adventures um has

01:34:10.679 --> 01:34:14.800
been um this thing from Aaron Manning

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.080
was really taken on this notion of

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:22.400
neurot typicality as systemic not

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.639
individual I mean it's kind of a moving

01:34:25.639 --> 01:34:28.080
horizon line that's produced by every

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.360
era so to speak and I would say with

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.080
Alexander the paradigmatic of the

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.239
technology and

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:39.719
um

01:34:39.719 --> 01:34:42.000
neurodiversity

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.159
um as this exploration you know without

01:34:46.159 --> 01:34:49.920
comparison where I read this book called

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:54.719
Plankton Dreams by artistic author and I

01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:58.080
really recommend it because it was 90

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.199
Pages it was very

01:35:00.199 --> 01:35:03.159
transformative the main character is a

01:35:03.159 --> 01:35:06.880
boy who has to go to a special needs

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.000
program just to kind of help his mother

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.679
who is doing workshops to explain how

01:35:13.679 --> 01:35:17.719
she works with him and he knows what

01:35:17.719 --> 01:35:21.560
he's going to be facing and he sets

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.440
himself is only his own learning goals

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:28.960
and he says so why wouldn't an autistic

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.000
study neurot

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.520
typicality and and it's just beautifully

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.719
written with wonderful irony and

01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:43.159
satire and it just struck me that narot

01:35:43.159 --> 01:35:45.280
typicality as

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.920
a

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.040
um kind of almost moal you know like a

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.600
luggage

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.239
word could help us kind of understand

01:35:58.239 --> 01:36:00.760
how first all you can never be

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.960
neurotypical enough you know whatever

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:10.679
the context demands that n typ to

01:36:10.679 --> 01:36:13.239
be and

01:36:13.239 --> 01:36:17.159
so in relating to each person like he

01:36:17.159 --> 01:36:22.040
says his name is Tito so he's Tito istic

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.600
and Eileen is

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.280
alistic and Bonita would be

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.800
bistic you know and it's I don't know if

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.560
I can

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.639
articulate the kind of metamorphosis

01:36:40.639 --> 01:36:44.480
that that played but it it it has

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.639
allowed me because like the owner of

01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:49.880
Lucy is kind of what would be

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.760
conventionally called on the Spectrum

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:57.119
he's kind of a polymath but you know you

01:36:57.119 --> 01:37:01.119
can't speak to him the same way as you

01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:04.280
would narot typically expect and you

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.679
know we've been so playful around this

01:37:06.679 --> 01:37:10.159
whole Lucy thing partially because I'm

01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:13.760
not expecting him to really understand

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.199
that for me to have this huge dog in my

01:37:16.199 --> 01:37:17.400
little

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.280
studio is not a neurotypical situation

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.280
and I'm having to be

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.960
neurodiverse to open up to that and in

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.360
that way I can have a different

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.199
conversation with him and then that

01:37:32.199 --> 01:37:34.639
changes the conversation of anybody else

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:37.000
who asks me how are you putting up with

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.440
this situation of this dog that poops at

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.159
3:00 a.m. and whatever and and somehow

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:50.239
that entire kind of well with the bio

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:52.320
course that he's doing right now and

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.199
with Aon Manning they've basically come

01:37:55.199 --> 01:37:59.280
to this having narot typicality and

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.960
colonialism be one of the same

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.760
thing which of course keeps

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.639
morphing depending on whatever context

01:38:08.639 --> 01:38:14.760
you're in um so I don't know how in the

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.440
popup school that would play out but for

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.000
me it's been

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.920
really kind of infusing humor and

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.360
curiosity

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.599
and uh

01:38:31.599 --> 01:38:34.040
suspending these other ways where

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.920
entitlement sort of interferes with the

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.599
ability to engage with actually what's

01:38:40.599 --> 01:38:44.239
unfolding like what about me and you

01:38:44.239 --> 01:38:46.560
know who's thinking how this is

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.480
affecting me or whatever and it's like

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.239
who the cares you know the self

01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:55.800
construct anyway you

01:39:03.599 --> 01:39:06.560
know yeah I mean that's a whole another

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.599
thing I I I I'm hoping that

01:39:09.599 --> 01:39:14.080
bio he's I believe he'll be in

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.440
Massachusetts this year coming year

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:21.440
2024 and I'm hoping he'll bring his L

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.360
down to work with the

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.070
horses

01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:28.159
[Music]

01:39:28.159 --> 01:39:30.040
um we'll

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.560
see that would be great you know I mean

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.080
he brings in are you familiar bunny with

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.599
Fon D

01:39:41.639 --> 01:39:44.360
work no but I think there's a lot to

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.360
explore like with bio

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.800
like I wouldn't say I

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:55.760
agree with everywhere he's going with

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.880
like colon like I like his Exile his

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.159
Sanctuary um this this this is a

01:40:03.159 --> 01:40:07.639
slippery slope for me to equate autism

01:40:07.639 --> 01:40:11.760
neurotypical non- neurotypical

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.760
colonialism

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.520
um this interesting to me but I I'm it

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.599
like I want I would I would like him to

01:40:24.599 --> 01:40:27.719
slow down like these are kind

01:40:27.719 --> 01:40:31.760
of yeah

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.040
um I think

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.239
that I think that the envir you know the

01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:47.960
the the the cultural environment and the

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.920
physical environment is distorting

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.080
you know it's changing people's nervous

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.560
system and their

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.320
brains um I don't think we

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.719
can just say well that's good to think

01:41:04.719 --> 01:41:07.159
it's not good it's just colonialism you

01:41:07.159 --> 01:41:09.880
know what I mean it's it's a little he's

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.679
a little too sweeping but he's also a

01:41:12.679 --> 01:41:17.000
poet he's not really meant to be

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.760
read with this kind of lens that that

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.520
handy cuffs handcuffs him to literal

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.000
literality So my answer to that is why

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.880
don't you bring you know my answer was

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.520
why don't you bring them down to work

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.400
with the

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.719
horses uh there's a lot

01:41:35.719 --> 01:41:39.000
of uh literature on horses working with

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.239
autistic people I've worked with ADHD

01:41:43.239 --> 01:41:46.560
young people like pretty per bad you

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.239
know pretty severe um but I haven't

01:41:49.239 --> 01:41:52.090
worked with an autistic person

01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:53.760
[Music]

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.960
um so I think something like that could

01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.679
help open the

01:41:59.679 --> 01:42:05.119
expiration um but that being said if the

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:08.159
the generations are going through an

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:10.080
environment

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.360
that's changing our brains then then we

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.760
have to

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:20.119
embrace those changes I mean we are We

01:42:20.119 --> 01:42:22.520
Are Who We Are

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:25.880
are um if we have nuclear war and

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.840
everybody has like tumors and radiation

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.340
sickness and that's who we become we

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.239
[Music]

01:42:35.239 --> 01:42:39.560
become what we interact with

01:42:40.599 --> 01:42:43.599
so

01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:49.040
yeah so you know I'm I'm

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:52.159
still this is a a very beautiful

01:42:52.159 --> 01:42:54.400
exploration and I'm and

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.880
I'm and you know I'm not sure where I

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.080
overlap and where I disagree or

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.400
something you know I don't I don't think

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.360
it's great that people are you know

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.840
pretty soon 70% of the population will

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.159
be obese and have diabetes I don't I

01:43:12.159 --> 01:43:13.960
don't think that's good I don't think

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.320
that you can just say well to say it's

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.679
not good is just colonizing I just I

01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:21.280
just

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.080
no if that's what it is that's it is

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.159
that's who we are now but so I'm not

01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:28.280
saying to blame people I'm saying we

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.800
actually can't blame people um but I

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.360
think one of my favorite examples of

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.840
that is December

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.400
23rd

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.599
1973 hundreds of thousands of persons

01:43:46.599 --> 01:43:48.840
were declared

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.239
cured when

01:43:51.239 --> 01:43:54.199
the American Psychiatric association

01:43:54.199 --> 01:43:58.719
took homosexuality off the

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.760
DSM yeah but I don't think this is a a

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.320
similar situation

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.760
because

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.760
homosexuality uh PE people related to

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.199
homosexuality like it was a

01:44:18.199 --> 01:44:20.719
novel neuroatypical

01:44:20.719 --> 01:44:22.480
thing that happened

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.440
recently homosexuality has been

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.880
practiced by cultures Forever

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.360
Until American Catholic protestantism

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.280
declared it a sin I mean it's not like

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.119
and that was the mistake people thought

01:44:38.119 --> 01:44:40.639
oh the culture is getting so you know

01:44:40.639 --> 01:44:43.440
perverse and this and that but it was

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:46.040
only much more recently that it became a

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:48.880
problem than the fact that it was

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.159
happening right so

01:44:51.159 --> 01:44:54.320
so we're talking about autism is very

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.520
very

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.080
recent truly a recent

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.040
phenomenon uh ADHD we don't know but

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.159
ADHD is something that could be more

01:45:05.159 --> 01:45:08.520
structural um but we don't know whereas

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.119
homosexuality was not a

01:45:11.119 --> 01:45:15.480
recent cultural emergence it it was the

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.920
fact that people thought homosexuality

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.560
was weird was actually a recent

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.599
invention a novel invention by Western

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.440
Catholics abortion is not a new fad

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:34.920
people have been infanti infanto what is

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.960
it called infanticide has been around in

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.320
cultures

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:41.280
forever so this is this

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.880
is you know what you see what I'm saying

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.880
there're these things are not new autism

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.599
I believe is quite or the or the the the

01:45:50.599 --> 01:45:52.920
incidence of obesity the incidence of

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.760
diabetes the incidence of autism is

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.639
new it's something

01:46:01.639 --> 01:46:05.400
new it just just is it's not something

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.119
we pretended wasn't in the human system

01:46:08.119 --> 01:46:10.719
for a long time and

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:16.239
now uh we're changing our minds about

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.440
it yeah I can say I've

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:27.239
um you know dug deep into it but I've I

01:46:27.239 --> 01:46:30.000
don't know because of the monetization

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.960
of any kind of division whether it's

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.520
along gender class race lines you know

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.400
it's it's just automatic because of the

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.119
click and bait I mean it's not even like

01:46:43.119 --> 01:46:47.440
an ideological war it's just talk about

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.239
aggregor

01:46:49.239 --> 01:46:53.480
um and and so I found that this notion

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.880
of neurot typicality as a

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.679
systemic way of designating a

01:47:01.679 --> 01:47:04.920
mechanism that

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.840
says this is good that's bad or in

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:16.199
degrees um might be a way to not fall

01:47:16.199 --> 01:47:18.480
into the

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.320
polarizations that are so

01:47:22.599 --> 01:47:27.000
exploited so easily in this agregan kind

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.360
of way that just pches like

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.040
toire I'm going to post in the in in the

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.280
popup School an absolutely mindboggling

01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.480
performance of Kevin

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:46.239
spacy of um a piece from Shakespeare's

01:47:46.239 --> 01:47:50.400
um tus I think it's the name and and and

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.800
it's like Shakespeare and cancel culture

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.239
and I mean the man's been exonerated out

01:47:56.239 --> 01:47:59.360
of absolutely every

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.280
accusation every

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.679
trial um declared innocent and yet you

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:08.560
know this is the first time she's really

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.960
invited to to to to to be present with

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.480
what he has to offer and it's really

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.760
really I had to watch it like three or

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.920
four times it was so powerful I'll post

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.920
it um but I I would like if you haven't

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.719
heard of him

01:48:29.719 --> 01:48:33.320
f um because this is you know he started

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.159
right after second world war um I I'll

01:48:37.159 --> 01:48:40.440
post something right now on him because

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.320
I I don't know I just have this

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.239
intuition that you're going to see

01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:49.360
something there that um connects with

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.000
some of the work you're

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.480
doing there's not a lot translated

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.080
unfortunately but I think you'll get a

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.920
sense

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:01.440
of

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:04.760
um because nobody was working with

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:07.639
autism you know

01:49:07.639 --> 01:49:10.960
1962 and he spent 30

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.480
years

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.199
with so-called autistic kids um without

01:49:18.199 --> 01:49:22.119
any of this institutional

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.880
um yeah I I think there's something and

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.599
I think you can probably pick something

01:49:28.599 --> 01:49:30.560
from this

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.560
that um I I don't

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.080
have it's not what I

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.400
do I'm

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.119
here I have something to say

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.679
say oh my God was that the same thing

01:49:55.679 --> 01:49:58.840
you were working on the other day yep oh

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.159
my God got little

01:50:01.159 --> 01:50:04.520
ears and uh it's

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.520
done that was fast I

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.400
mean well well it's not fast because you

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.639
had you were working forever to se it

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:15.480
together it was intense because I

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.320
whatever but anyways I finished the baby

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.040
hasn't come yet but

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.470
that's so

01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:27.360
[Music]

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.199
cute that would fit my

01:50:37.639 --> 01:50:42.040
dog my hood was way out of proportion

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.760
because it's a seed Stitch yeah and I

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.719
get I get kind of loose in the seed

01:50:47.719 --> 01:50:52.040
Stitch Department yeah

01:50:53.599 --> 01:50:57.320
anyways they liked it that's all that

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:59.639
matters how when's the due date pretty

01:50:59.639 --> 01:51:02.079
soon right tomorrow

01:51:02.079 --> 01:51:05.239
tomorrow yeah oh so right on time look

01:51:05.239 --> 01:51:08.520
at that

01:51:08.599 --> 01:51:11.520
yep yep I just realized you could use

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.760
these to knit well there you

01:51:16.079 --> 01:51:18.920
go I always can you hear that my mother

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.880
used to KN I just that that noise it's

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:24.760
very comforting you would watch TV and

01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.040
she'd be

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.040
like

01:51:31.239 --> 01:51:33.639
yeah it's a funny thing because I

01:51:33.639 --> 01:51:36.520
thought it would be kind of a

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:40.040
mellow exercise kind of like put me in

01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.480
kind of an open space but it's actually

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.400
a very linear exercise yeah and I

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:48.159
noticed that it it keeps me especially

01:51:48.159 --> 01:51:49.639
if I have a pattern that I'm trying to

01:51:49.639 --> 01:51:50.599
follow

01:51:50.599 --> 01:51:53.520
kind of keeps me in a focused place and

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:58.960
not a more diffused place so uh I it's a

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.400
it's a real

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:05.360
um gift of time to that kind of purpose

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:08.000
yeah that's a discipline it's a

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.159
discipline

01:52:09.159 --> 01:52:11.480
yeah I don't know how much more knitting

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:14.119
I'm gonna do but it was really helpful

01:52:14.119 --> 01:52:15.520
to listen to

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:18.400
matalina and to do this because I had to

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.520
redo the binding because I made it too

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.679
tight and because if if the conversation

01:52:23.679 --> 01:52:25.960
gets outside of what I can really fully

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.280
get yeah it gave me something to okay

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.119
I'm doing something that I understand

01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:35.440
here yeah and it's like it's like when

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.880
you're a kids and there's conversation

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:40.280
that you don't understand but the the

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.119
lyrical right the the there's something

01:52:43.119 --> 01:52:45.599
about

01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:49.079
hearing the adults laughing and then Qui

01:52:49.079 --> 01:52:50.760
you know there's something about it that

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.199
still is a transmission I would say that

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.119
was Kimberly was saying there's

01:52:55.119 --> 01:52:59.520
something very social about it um and in

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.920
fact uh we had this Workshop here a

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.880
couple of the end of last month and you

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.599
know I was really tired we worked really

01:53:08.599 --> 01:53:10.040
hard to clean up the place get the

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.679
horses ready and then we had all these

01:53:11.679 --> 01:53:15.400
people here and at lunch you know I just

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.560
kind of like spaced out and there was

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.440
all these people here and there was all

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.920
these conversations happening and it was

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:24.960
fun just to space out and

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.760
just

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.280
experience the life that was there and

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.239
literally I was so brain de I had

01:53:35.239 --> 01:53:38.320
no ability to enter a convers you know I

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:41.000
could see oh there's Zach and stuff's

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
happening over there and but I didn't

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.159
have

01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:47.960
any impulse to figure out what was

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.760
happening you know um

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.199
plus everybody was a lot younger than me

01:54:07.199 --> 01:54:08.960
and I was

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.740
like I like the

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:13.819
[Music]

01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.760
grandma

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.920
that's why I usually invite Sandra to

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.320
these things and it's

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:31.280
like have to be only

01:54:34.719 --> 01:54:37.719
Elder me and David will hold down the

01:54:37.719 --> 01:54:42.560
Elder seat yeah well we're not good at

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.119
it I'll tell okay I'll tell a joke

01:54:45.119 --> 01:54:46.520
you're not old

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.800
enough no but let me tell the story we

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.639
were in this Parallax course right on

01:54:51.639 --> 01:54:53.400
the convivial

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.440
society and in one of the campfires we

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.560
had this young guy in his wife who were

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.960
very intelligent had a lot of energy had

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.480
a lot of things to

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.360
say and they were they

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.960
were talkers like they could talk for 20

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.880
25 minutes on and on and on and not

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.000
realize

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.920
that they they weren't talking to anyone

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.840
like

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.280
um and and they were like they were like

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.159
the Smothers Brothers because when he'd

01:55:28.159 --> 01:55:31.000
get tired as soon as he'd get like have

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.199
a little break she'd start you know and

01:55:34.199 --> 01:55:37.719
then he'd get real energize so

01:55:37.719 --> 01:55:41.760
so um so the David and Sandra and I run

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:46.199
that call and after that he got finished

01:55:46.199 --> 01:55:50.920
at one point he's he's finished and then

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:53.440
David and Sandra I think it was first

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:56.199
David maybe or first Sandra they both

01:55:56.199 --> 01:55:58.239
did their thing you know when David does

01:55:58.239 --> 01:56:00.440
something and he like really touches Bas

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:01.840
with someone and the tone of the

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.840
conversation changes the way Phoebe did

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.400
it last

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.480
time and then Sandra said one of the

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.840
things like one of her things that like

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.840
really

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.639
lands and the energy came up in this

01:56:17.639 --> 01:56:19.000
young guy and he's like blah blah blah

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.320
blah blah blah you know we don't have

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.119
any Elders we don't have any

01:56:22.119 --> 01:56:25.360
Elders it just went on and on and on

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:28.840
it's like like they did this this this

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.679
huge like love

01:56:30.679 --> 01:56:33.719
bomb insightful Elder thing and then

01:56:33.719 --> 01:56:36.000
then as soon as they started going on he

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.840
just complained that there was no Elders

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:40.760
in society anymore so the next time he

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:42.920
wasn't there and we we were all trying

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.840
to

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.040
deconstruct uh why we were such

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.880
failures at show showing off as showing

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.760
up as Elders it was extremely uh obvious

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.920
that we had

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.920
failed

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.040
yeah yeah I really wanted to know what

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.440
like what's an elder for him you know

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.679
it's like it's very curious I don't know

01:57:22.679 --> 01:57:25.000
I it's it's I know that most people

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.639
don't think they they eliminate from

01:57:27.639 --> 01:57:30.760
that category white

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:34.840
people um so they often think Elders are

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:37.040
like dressed in indigenous clothes and

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.239
have lots of like dark skin and Crags on

01:57:41.239 --> 01:57:42.280
their

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.800
faces

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.239
um uh because one time I went on Twitter

01:57:49.239 --> 01:57:51.400
and people were like we don't have any

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.400
elders and I named a bunch of women that

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.960
I thought were elders and they're like

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.920
they're all white you know like all

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:59.159
right whatever it I guess white

01:57:59.159 --> 01:58:01.320
people can't be

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:05.119
Elders I get it so that could have been

01:58:05.119 --> 01:58:07.560
you know and I mean white people were

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.400
saying that white people can't be Elders

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:11.400
so I think that might have been part of

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.520
the

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:21.320
reason I'll for Success next time

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.280
time I mean Elder means you're going to

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.800
die and you know

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:33.400
it what's to argue about that I mean

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:36.040
like eldership you know Elders eldership

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.400
the role of the Elder in

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.560
society you you don't even have to be

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.199
old to be I don't know I don't know what

01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:45.199
they were talking about I thought I it

01:58:45.199 --> 01:58:48.599
was just odd that after these two people

01:58:48.599 --> 01:58:51.599
who like know how to I mean they're not

01:58:51.599 --> 01:58:54.760
performing and and and usually people

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.920
get it was followed by a diet trab that

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.280
there was no El Elders in

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.840
society I just thought well I can

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.960
understand that we've become sort of

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.440
death phobic and aging puic and I mean I

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:11.440
sort of shock people by saying you know

01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.960
this is what I'm doing now is

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:14.920
apprenticing to become an

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:19.079
elder um and and it's not easy in in the

01:59:19.079 --> 01:59:22.440
way because it's like oh okay the 60s

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.599
then new 50 and 7s then you whatever and

01:59:25.599 --> 01:59:31.320
I'm like no I want the age I am okay you

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:35.400
know but I'm not interested in these you

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.040
know

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:40.599
substitutions um but it's it's not easy

01:59:40.599 --> 01:59:42.560
to do it maybe that's what they were

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.639
talking

01:59:43.639 --> 01:59:45.960
about that's not the point the point was

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:49.400
that David and Sandra were exemplary

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.920
just moments

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:54.320
before and then then he ends up and we

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:57.440
were just laughing at ourselves because

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:01.239
like okay well we must not be showing up

02:00:01.239 --> 02:00:06.320
and I don't know anyways um so we had

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:09.159
like another rambling conversation today

02:00:09.159 --> 02:00:13.679
um but hopefully it was useful um and uh

02:00:13.679 --> 02:00:15.960
we'll be back on

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:20.400
Saturday and um maybe I'll try

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:23.320
to I'll be back in my other office and

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:27.880
I'll share some maybe some more content

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:30.440
um is Saturday the last one no because

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:33.079
then we have another Thursday so we can

02:00:33.079 --> 02:00:35.199
ramble on next

02:00:35.199 --> 02:00:38.079
Thursday um if that's what we need to do

02:00:38.079 --> 02:00:40.440
thank you very much

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:45.040
all um for helping Phoebe

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.199
finish her knitting it was a good job we

02:00:49.199 --> 02:00:51.920
we held the space for her to cross the

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.280
finish line so I feel like that's

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.560
success



## Cohort 4

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.040
okay can you hear me is it too

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.119
loud yeah I have a new setup here so is

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.760
that better little better

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.240
okay all righty all

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.400
righty here we are

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.040
are we ready to talk about Igor today or

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.239
do we want to talk about something

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.280
else let's Melina is she's raring to

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.199
go okay I I I'm I'm gonna leave it at

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.399
that but I've just got to say your

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.840
conversation with

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.359
Alexander I'm still high on it I mean

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.159
it's so crazy because I feel like that

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.840
conversation was already happening

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.080
inside my head like big time I I think

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.119
you remember we were in the conviviality

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.200
thing and I said Andrew you've got to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.920
get these two on the same you know

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.600
conversation

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.400
and it it it just I I haven't finished

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.560
because I've gone so slow you know I'm

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.439
I'm going

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.360
through you know not even step by step

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.840
it's like this cognitive co-evolution as

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.920
an experience okay because it is the two

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.799
of you being these

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.719
um you know I

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.719
think

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.119
um it I feel like I'm receiving messages

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.560
from the future from both of you you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.000
know in in this crazy way and i' I've

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.640
honestly never seen Alexander so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
rigorous because of you okay because he

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.560
goes off on these

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.560
provocative tangents just to like

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.519
provoke but he has no need to do that

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.160
with you and that is just so exciting

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.959
because then he's at his

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.040
best but you're keeping him you know

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.560
just in this Rhythm you know it's like

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.080
there's this Rhythm and it's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.200
so exciting I mean and and nobody has

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.879
ever really engaged this way with

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.680
somebody who has spent a fair amount of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.920
time trying to dig into this melian age

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.200
if I want to use Pascal's you know you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.400
know sort of paradigmatic

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.200
designation and I'm I'm just so grateful

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.840
I mean this like really had to happen

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.760
and it had to cross the ocean it

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.239
just really had to happen and I think

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.760
it's such a crucial moment and I felt

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.159
like you what you came through of course

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.720
I'm informed by all the work we've been

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
doing um that my listening is is not

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.120
quite as illiterate as as it would have

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.439
been

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.439
otherwise but seriously I mean and it's

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.599
the whole thing I mean which includes

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.439
the performance you know which I think

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.439
is crucial right now because we are in

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.640
the melian age and we're not just in the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.400
Gutenberg realm it has to have this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.319
Dynamic you know instability that you

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.840
don't know what's going to happen

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.400
whether you're going to start yelling at

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.239
each other or whether you know and yet

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.319
you navigated it with such

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.480
elegant I mean it's just you know you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.959
know hats off really banina I'm just

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.160
beside myself I'm so excited thank you

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.919
did anybody else see that yet

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.919
no we had that one I had the perspectiva

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.720
presentation and tempor that was pretty

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.000
good um yeah it was good right um oh it

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.400
was amazing but this was so Dynamic you

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.639
know it's like because people don't

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.840
really I haven't seen you in dialogue

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.080
where there's an engagement that goes

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.400
out that just goes out in the wilderness

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.360
that goes out in in in the wildness you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.440
know quite that way I mean either

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.600
they're intimidated by you or something

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.960
or they just skirt around it but this

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.919
was a

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.440
dance loved it I don't know how you feel

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.240
about it but I'd be very curious how you

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.479
feel about it no it was great I I didn't

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.759
watch the recording and I don't know if

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.720
they let it in they did they leave in

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.520
that part where I had to go and sign for

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.720
a

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.319
delivery I I think that's right at the

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.280
end end or or may it's toward the middle

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.639
but I yeah no you had to walk away and

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.639
and in that moment um uh Alexander says

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.319
to Andrew we're we're we're right in it

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.520
we're right in it this is a great start

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.479
you know I mean honestly he he really

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.639
just totally engaged and I'm so excited

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.680
because I think this is the kind

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.960
of uh symbiotic and an agonism that I

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.720
feel needs to be happening you know

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.120
whether you want to call it ritual

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.840
descent or whatever for there to be for

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.599
it to come alive so it's not this you

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.000
know just verbera you know of of

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.039
philosophy no the stakes are high you

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:26.039
know and and and it's full

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.199
on sorry I'm really no no no yeah I'm

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.759
glad you said that there's a lot

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.520
happening like part of it part of what's

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.199
happening is

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.759
this

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.400
uh um push of mind to to develop the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.840
popup school to you know to what did I

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.280
write I don't even remember what I wrote

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.360
what did I write 2024 is the year what

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.440
did I

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.360
write that we break out

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.400
um and

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.400
um

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.520
I'm just gonna put in the chat okay

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.080
because I just put

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.840
um yeah I'm not gonna say okay so

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.879
there's a lot going on go I'm really

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:16.000
loud right because I can hear myself is

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.919
no can I hear myself I have this weird

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:24.120
microphone so if I'm okay that's okay um

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.319
so part of what's happening is this like

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.240
breaking out and um

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.919
also

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:35.479
wanting um people to know that if you're

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.800
basically the big premium is for yearly

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.479
paid subscribers because if you're

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:41.280
yearly paid

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.319
subscribers I mean in this case the

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:46.000
Alexander Bard thing was completely free

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.599
but like everything I do will come in as

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:53.039
a recorded at least a recorded version

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.759
um and so I'm trying

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.800
to um go out and add value in you know

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.280
go out and add value in in in a certain

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.319
way and I have other initiatives too um

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:07.400
that people are proposing to me but it's

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.919
for me it's always like well how can

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:14.199
this how can this benefit yearly paid

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:16.280
subscribers I mean that's kind of my

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.840
target audience

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.479
um but and we're planning to do there's

00:08:21.479 --> 00:08:24.360
going to be another uh one with that

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.199
what that that one was supposed to be

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:30.120
with also Alexander elen um but he broke

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.519
his leg and it's kind of good because we

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.240
had able to establish more back

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.240
background and then we're gonna have one

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.519
more with him and then we're gonna have

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.880
a series next year which will be part of

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.200
like what the what we bring in to the

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.560
school um and you know it is a kind of

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.720
dance it's a kind of dance of allowing

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.519
these hyper creative people to be

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:56.839
creative but how many times did I say

00:08:56.839 --> 00:08:59.839
I'm gon to ask you a question I'm gonna

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.959
ask you a question at the end of this uh

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.279
Alexander because they get into this

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.000
like they just they're just explosions

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.839
of creative like blah blah

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.519
blah and

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.480
um so that's that's part of it with them

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.200
there's other initiatives like that yeah

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.800
David are

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.440
you um do you want to say something yeah

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.640
I do want to say something and I'm

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.600
having this strange kind of like outof

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.600
Body Experience between Holly and Kevin

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.839
they're with this kind of I can't tell

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:41.160
which dimension who's in and what's

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.480
going across and the reason I bring this

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.880
up that drawing you can tell right

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.959
because of the it's be listen it's

00:09:49.959 --> 00:09:53.600
because you are one of those hyper

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.480
creatives that that um movie

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.920
presentation you put together did the

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.320
same kind of thing Holly and Kevin are

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.040
doing to me it moved me through

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.480
different dimensions and it wasn't what

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.000
was the word matalena just you

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.920
used

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.399
verata no verbera verbera it wasn't

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:22.079
verbera it was this it was this you know

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:26.200
body out of body inbody in time out okay

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.640
I G to ask you a question and put you on

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.320
the spot did the word words

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.839
matter not really right with like we're

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:38.279
not at the point me Alexander barter not

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.399
at the point where the words matter oh

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.720
no I'm talking about the uh the movies

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.920
you did for oh with perspectiva yeah

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.760
sorry those

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.160
words yeah did matter and didn't

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.920
matter because what came back to me was

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.800
the prompt How does the structure of

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.839
time time change and the problem I had

00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:06.480
is I kind of move slow in sensing so

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.120
there wasn't much time between movies to

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.519
sense Beyond just the obvious for me I

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:15.639
knew there was more there but um my

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:20.079
point is you're one of the hyper

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.200
creatives thank you for the work you

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.079
do I think the words matter like a

00:11:29.079 --> 00:11:33.839
specify one moment for me that was key I

00:11:33.839 --> 00:11:36.839
mean like to me it was a moment of this

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:38.040
be the last comment because I don't

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.079
think other people saw it you okay it

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.639
was a moment of

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.320
metamorphosis I mean literally like

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.600
before my eyes when you took

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.000
methos into lyrical oh oh my you see it

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.160
fixed because it fixed this

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.399
confusion yes it wasn't challenge so

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.320
this I'm glad you saw that because this

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.959
is a big deal he's he's gonna change his

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.760
 masculine or patriarchal blah

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.000
blah blah blah and he's gonna say the

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.959
Mythos is not Mythos it's

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.959
lyrical and so it's a big deal for us

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:19.880
because we're gonna be going on next

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.519
year and talk about creating lyrical

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:25.839
culture right yeah oh my God that was so

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:28.040
but it didn't threaten him it was much

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.519
better uh

00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.920
helped him understand what he was saying

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.680
see I mean I've been listening to or or

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.199
following I mean I've talked to

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:40.760
Alexander personally whatever um because

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.760
he really has this extraordinarily

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.600
Generous Heart he really does I mean he

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.760
can sound like an and insult

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.120
people and whatever but underneath

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.600
there's just extraordinary generosity

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.399
yeah and and and that's what you

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:03.240
connected with and that that that's what

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.240
was so beautiful because it was a worthy

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.639
interloc yeah seriously so the point

00:13:09.639 --> 00:13:11.920
here for the rest of the people is we

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.320
have Alexander who's in this you

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.720
know you know everybody's got their

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.720
performance stick but we've enabled to

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.120
slip in this interesting concept of

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.279
lyric philosophy and lyric culture

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:31.160
as actually what he's actually been

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.040
looking for um um and that I think was

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.880
important for our our community and

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.440
um yeah

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.480
so so enough of that for now because can

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.680
you define what you mean by lyric

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.680
philosophy and lyric culture okay so no

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.680
not right now because that's basically

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.399
what we're going to do in the early part

00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:01.240
of

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.000
2024 um and um I'll be starting to

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.800
writing a seeds essay series on lyric

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.880
culture um lyric culture is just what

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.720
I'm saying is a kind of a cultural

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.480
scene that is founded on lyric

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.759
philosophy and lyric philosophy is

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:27.079
basically uh a word in invented or an

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:30.399
idea kind of composed by janza

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:33.880
Wiki um

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.680
so uh I'll give one felt sense of it and

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.920
that is it doesn't

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.160
isue it's not allergic

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.199
to um

00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:50.199
theoretic philosophy which is you know

00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:53.120
most of the western

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.759
Canon um but it's very interested in

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:59.959
attending to particulars

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:03.320
this particular moment this like these

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.680
Chopsticks I happen to

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.720
think extremely

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.440
nice because it's just handcarved from

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.639
wood so you know you know these these

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.800
noticings are very

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.399
particular so that's part of lyric but

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:23.519
the word lyric is comes from

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:27.160
musicality and that is if I'm listening

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.639
to a or piece of orchestral

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:34.759
music where is the music is it in the

00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:38.160
first note is it in the second note is

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.079
it in the last

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:45.240
note is it in this transitional period

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.360
between two different kind of Acts in a

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.319
in the music is is it in the Overture

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:53.560
where is the

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.560
music and so lyric

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.199
philosophy um is like that so if you

00:16:00.199 --> 00:16:02.040
want to know what lyric culture is like

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.920
you've been embedded in it in the popup

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.240
school that's why you can't go home and

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.680
tell people what you

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.920
learned it'd be like trying to tell

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.839
people what what what's the music that

00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:14.959
you just heard well is it C minor or F

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.800
major or

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.720
G or an A minor chord or a fifth chord

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.959
where's the

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:24.519
music you come home from the Opera or

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.079
you come home from an orchestra like and

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:28.199
they say okay what what what did you

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:29.160
hear

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.199
how could you possibly tell someone

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.079
where where is where is what you've

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:35.480
heard where is what you've learned and

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.399
so lyric has to do

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.040
with but on the other hand after you

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.839
hear a symphony you have it

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:47.519
all you have it

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.399
all but you've never experienced it all

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.880
or is it on the sheet music where is

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.440
where is where is it lyric philosophy is

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.720
the same way

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.319
it's like music that hangs

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:09.039
Together lyric culture would be the same

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.799
way it's not it's not its purpose is not

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.679
to come to some kind of conclusion at

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:18.000
the

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.039
end or if it does the conclusions

00:17:21.039 --> 00:17:25.120
doesn't make any sense the conclusions

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.400
don't make any sense without the journey

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.520
there so that's what lyric philosophy is

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.919
it doesn't matter if it's conceptual or

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.200
poetic I mean Jan Z wikii is a

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.840
conceptual po a conceptual philosopher a

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.240
poet and a musician not surprising that

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.360
she comes up with this term of lyric

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.480
philosophy um so this

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.520
is this is the

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.840
foundational felt sense of lyric

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:06.919
culture can I give my sense of

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.480
what I might think it might mean from

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.000
what you just

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.039
said that was a question oh yeah yeah

00:18:19.039 --> 00:18:22.039
um

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.400
so I did this whole reading of this

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.919
person that I studied

00:18:28.919 --> 00:18:32.000
and I I had the sense

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.600
of getting the sense of his whole

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.320
Symphony that his work was actually a

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.520
symphony and it took a long time to um

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.280
even any one part of it I could feel oh

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.760
this is part of a symphony but it took a

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.559
long time to be able to hold the whole

00:18:51.559 --> 00:18:53.159
of the

00:18:53.159 --> 00:18:55.960
symphony

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.480
uh without having to break it down down

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.799
into its parts and its meaning it took a

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:04.080
long time to be able to hold it without

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.520
having to deconstruct it and so all of

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.240
the nuts and bolts are the parts of the

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.280
symphony are there and necessary and yet

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.919
after a certain point there's a an

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:23.720
experience of the wholeness of uh you

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.600
could even say the posture of it or the

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.120
wholeness of um what it's holding

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.000
and

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.080
and what I

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.440
think what I would make that mean and I

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.640
obviously don't know is

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:45.559
that to be able to engage in lyric

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:50.600
philosophy you would have to be able to

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.120
hold the wholeness of something the like

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.039
you say where's the music

00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:02.480
there's a whole gestal that's have many

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.640
many many

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:07.400
components and um it feels like it's a

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.000
new level of skill and skill sounds like

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.360
way too small a

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.440
word um you have to have gone through

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.360
the nuts and bolts and nuts and bolts

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.480
and nuts and bolts and nuts and bolts to

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.960
finally uh feel like you

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.159
can um

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.919
trust a larger currency that's moving

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:42.720
trust your ability to to to to sense it

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.840
and to hold it so I just made that up

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.080
but that's my thought about yeah I mean

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.919
there's some things that sound right and

00:20:49.919 --> 00:20:52.120
then there's things that I'm not

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.960
sure what you mean

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.159
because one of the things we have to how

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:01.159
do you hold the whole the

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.760
gastal um if you hold it through a

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.159
narrative like you have a narrative and

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.840
you connect all these nodes well that's

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.679
not lyric culture that's just another

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:12.080
strategy through resonance yeah it would

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.679
through resonance to Resonance it yeah

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:18.799
and when you've gone

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.640
to a show an orchestra show I've gone to

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.320
I used to go to a lot of really complex

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.320
Jazz uh shows you come away and there's

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.000
no

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.159
way if you there's a certain is a

00:21:35.159 --> 00:21:38.919
certain eagerness to

00:21:38.919 --> 00:21:41.880
to capture what you just experienced and

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.279
there's no way you can capture it

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:46.559
especially these these

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:49.600
improvisational Jazz things we used to

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.360
go to um but your your your self has

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.600
captured it so there's no sense that

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.320
there's an organ that has to do

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.320
something after the

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.120
fact there's no sense that gee did I

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.480
really learn something because I don't

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.000
know what I learned there's a sense

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.159
that with the right so in in in lyric

00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:18.159
culture we're also going to learn about

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:21.520
uh a fan of Jan the wik which is Heidi's

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.360
Warren Heidi's uh attending as a sacred

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.240
art if you attend in the right way then

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.480
you've captured whole and it won't feel

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.000
like it because it's not a narratology

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.159
that connects the dots it's not a

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:38.120
philosophical system that connects the

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.200
dots you just have C you've

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.600
just you've captured it through your

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.840
body through the sensing through the

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.279
being attending in a certain way and and

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.480
that that has changed you

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.760
so so yes exactly what you said as long

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.080
as you're not working really hard after

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.000
the fact to capture either through

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.440
narrative or some kind of systemic

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.520
philosophical system what it is that

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.919
makes it

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:14.600
whole because the capture itself is a

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.559
partiality um now having said that we do

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:19.600
do that then we go and we talk about

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.799
janza Wiki and we make an NRA of I'm not

00:23:21.799 --> 00:23:23.440
I'm not saying that that doesn't carry

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.919
forward but your basic experience to it

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:28.400
is

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.600
it's not that without capturing it it's

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.640
going to somehow evade

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.640
me

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.520
um yeah something like

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.880
that but that's you know that's we're

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.880
talking about culture the origins of

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.559
culture uh we're looking at lyric cultur

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:56.039
as something going

00:23:56.039 --> 00:23:59.480
forward um and lyric culture has a lot

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.480
to do with

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.200
acknowledging

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.440
um

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.200
that you know when you're composing a

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.000
piece of music for

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.720
someone um you're composing for their

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.520
ears but you're also

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.120
composing for their imagination and

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.120
their affective resonance with the with

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.000
the

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.559
music um you're

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.600
speaking you're speaking a lot of

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.799
languages at the same time

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.240
time I'm going to throw something else

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.159
in here which was Herby Hancock gave the

00:24:40.159 --> 00:24:41.720
Norton

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.360
lectures um and for some reason those

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.600
were never

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.960
transcribed and I would like to think he

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.000
said they shouldn't be and they always

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.200
print the Lord Norton lectures so that's

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.960
kind of an interesting except

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.520
exception and in there one of the things

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.039
he talks about was the

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:11.039
relationship with technology of jazz

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:15.640
because Charlie Parker would not travel

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.559
without his um record player and and the

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:22.600
way he studied

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.039
Jazz was by playing the recordings you

00:25:27.039 --> 00:25:32.120
know and starts to scramble this whole

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.200
linear kind of Developmental

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.559
you know it just and and what Harvey

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:41.600
Hancock

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.799
was claiming was that jazz was the

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.840
ethics for the 21st century and I think

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.360
that completely aligns with um Yan fiki

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.399
because look at this one this is another

00:25:57.399 --> 00:25:58.840
little

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.120
fragment I I I

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.200
foraged and I just feel like it's so

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:10.279
popup schol I mean and you know it's

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:12.919
practice ceaselessly there's one art

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:15.960
wind in the Open Spaces grieving

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:20.360
laughing with us saying improvise you

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.720
know I

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.120
mean that's not the verbera that's not

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.880
the Dogma or the godma you know I like

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.520
to be dyslexic about that well the other

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.720
thing the katma gogma katma okay it um

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.640
so the other thing about

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.919
um jazz is if you if you're interested

00:26:45.919 --> 00:26:47.679
in creating a lyric culture you're like

00:26:47.679 --> 00:26:49.039
oh you know how can you create a culture

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:52.440
out of nothing well the American Jazz

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.480
that whole

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.960
culture um I mean nothing's created out

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.240
of nothing

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.399
but this is an independent culture grown

00:27:01.399 --> 00:27:05.200
homegrown culture in the US in that

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.520
sense they're kind of new indigenous uh

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.960
to the to this to this country um and um

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.240
so how how how does a

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.200
culture an africanamerican or a black

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:24.240
American culture emerge out of those

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.600
conditions right um and I've always

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.120
complain that like these black lives

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.159
matters and all these things they don't

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:35.200
emphasize enough the the emergence the

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.120
singular emergence of a culture

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.720
Independence really of past conditions

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.720
and in in Modern Times And um American

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.640
Jazz and all its

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.960
extensions uh into rap and stuff are are

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.960
um should be studied as an AS

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.320
anthropolog logical you know if you want

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.399
to understand how things

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:04.240
emerge uh there's hardly

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.279
anything um more interesting in

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:10.960
studying some of the Pioneers in that

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.200
movement because you're right they they

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.200
thought about it a lot they knew about

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.919
what they were doing they're extremely

00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:20.559
talented they many of them saw music as

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:21.519
pure

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:24.679
abstractions uh the way the way Mozart

00:28:24.679 --> 00:28:28.880
did and they studied Mozart and B

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.679
so

00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:33.480
uh yeah that's a real inspiration if you

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.720
want to start a new a new

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:49.399
culture um I had an experience over the

00:28:49.399 --> 00:28:51.200
summer at jazz I don't know if you want

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.080
to hear a story or if you want to do

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.399
some teaching but

00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.399
um

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.120
you know that Chopstick dance you just

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.480
did where's the

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:08.840
music I went to see a jazz performance a

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.039
live jazz performance at an iconic place

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:15.200
here in Los Angeles the Hollywood Bowl

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200
and the setup

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.600
was about a dozen

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.159
cellos no about a half dozen cellos

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:27.600
about a dozen strings in the back of the

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.440
stage and the front of the stage was 10

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.360
different piano kind of

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.480
instruments that were electronic and

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.200
piano and I mean all different kinds of

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.640
very

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.000
contemporary

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.120
instruments and there was one saxophone

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.320
player

00:30:00.519 --> 00:30:02.880
and it was the most

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.360
beautiful assemblage of music and Jazz

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.640
I've ever experienced I've spent my

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.799
whole life I used to sneak into bars

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:14.080
when I was 14 years old here to listen

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.640
to Jazz in Los

00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:21.279
Angeles and I went there thinking I

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:24.240
can't get into this electronic you

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.640
know I

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.240
mean and I'll tell you

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:32.919
you when I look now and see where was

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:36.840
that music I can't tell you it is inside

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.000
of me and it was a

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.880
Transcendent experience for

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.840
me and it was an iconic

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.399
jazz performer Pharaoh Sanders oh my God

00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:54.960
what he did about five years

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.440
ago well now seven years ago was he

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.440
hooked up with this electronic

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.679
contemporary group and created

00:31:04.679 --> 00:31:09.279
composed this Symphony and died before

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:11.799
the first time it was ever performed and

00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:14.919
I got to see it performed by an English

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:18.840
Sachs player that took his spot it

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.120
was just like what you said with those

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.720
did with those Chopsticks where's the

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.799
music it's inside of me

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:30.480
Bonnie so in the 80s when I lived in New

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.919
York and we had an artist L we would go

00:31:32.919 --> 00:31:35.799
see phell Sanders at the new school and

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:37.200
and then these

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.519
overnight uh things and one time I

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:44.279
brought uh my friend who is

00:31:44.279 --> 00:31:48.440
gay um he he started Living with this

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.639
German intellectual I think he was a

00:31:50.639 --> 00:31:53.120
medical researcher or something and I

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.360
was like oh let's bring him to see phell

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.519
Sanders and we went to see phah Sanders

00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:01.039
and this German intellectual got so

00:32:01.039 --> 00:32:04.120
upset he thought that he thought the

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.600
band was making fun of white people's

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.120
naiv that they were playing because

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.159
they'd go home and like you believe they

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:15.679
they pay for this I can walk right over

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:18.200
there and get my albums of pharoh

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.120
Sanders um yeah so that's the kind of

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.360
jazz we used to listen to I used to go

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.080
and listen to Steve Lacy I remember a

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.159
lot

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:30.760
and I would get so synesthetic that the

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.840
music was all these these visuals of

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.200
these notes that would change look like

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.480
do that would change color and then do

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.720
this you know of course it was because

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.399
part of it was because so late at night

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:47.720
and I worked and I was like drinking a

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.799
lot of caffeine and I was at these

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:55.080
concerts and and um being in these these

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.760
dimensional spaces of con Consciousness

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:03.360
that were like um magnificent you know

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.679
um and and I never thought it was a

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:08.240
coincidence there was some magic that

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.799
were was happening and actually I think

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:15.559
Ry and Marie were in I used to do uh um

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:18.799
a little workshop on circus Jazz how

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.399
circus Jazz opens the way your mind is

00:33:22.399 --> 00:33:24.559
wired

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:27.519
uh in a in a way that

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:30.440
is kind of one of the things meditation

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.039
can help you with

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:36.039
um but yeah phoh Sanders that's That's

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:39.080
Heavy hitting that's that that requires

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:43.799
a a very very skillful attending and a

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:46.960
letting go at the same

00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:51.039
time uh I would recommend Carla BL

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:53.279
escalator over the hill you could buy

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:55.360
the CD set it's an

00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:01.240
Offa Carla BL b y escalator over the

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.639
hill okay so one of the are there any

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.320
other comments I mean we're just kind of

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.599
this is the fireside chat so far but we

00:34:31.599 --> 00:34:34.119
can move

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:42.720
on I I have just a a thought that's

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.960
coming up

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.839
um this this idea of

00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:54.000
musicality of

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.879
song

00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.280
of tiny

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.160
elements weaving into something

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.160
bigger and the sun being

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.160
greater

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.040
um and the idea of

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:18.160
um transmission that happens through

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.680
song The Sound enters

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.640
us

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.800
um the vibrations do

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.400
and there's this um process of

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.760
entrainment right

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:41.000
where organisms begin to move

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.800
together when they're moving to a shared

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.640
song

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.960
so this is the practice of singing an

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.680
infant to

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:57.680
comfort while rocking

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.200
it's also sex it's

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.040
also huge groups of people listening to

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.440
music there is this life force of shared

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.040
experience in the

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.560
sounding but it's a

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.119
transmission that's that's

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.720
Mya

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.040
um I just wanted to share a little bit

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.839
about Jan

00:36:47.839 --> 00:36:53.200
zinsky and I have a question to ask um I

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.079
had an I had the experience of listening

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:59.680
to her read some of her

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:03.359
poetry and the

00:37:03.839 --> 00:37:06.000
experience I can't

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.839
decide whether I just don't have the

00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:13.760
ability to share that experience with

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.119
language or I don't want to it just

00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:21.560
doesn't matter and I'm just curious I'm

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.400
sitting with that because that might

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:27.640
unfold further um

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.079
H and I wonder also if it's a little bit

00:37:31.079 --> 00:37:35.720
relating to one of the allergies or that

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.599
I noticed when I was at University one

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:40.079
of my Majors was

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:42.800
English and I really

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.599
struggled to do this analytical

00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:50.400
unpacking of poetry it's like I lost

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.000
half of it as soon as I did it now or

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.880
all of it or really went into actually

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.119
went into a space that wasn't the poem

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:03.160
actually wasn't really that space once I

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.040
went

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.680
into listening to lectures breaking it

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.839
all down blah blah blah and then trying

00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:12.280
to write something in that way

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.760
myself and I'm wondering is that why I

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.560
don't want to maybe that just occurred

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.280
to me actually maybe that's why I don't

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.720
want to language this or I want to

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.079
language

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:27.000
it why do I need to language it at all

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.119
all cuz I heard Jan say very clearly

00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:34.680
that if we're going to use language we

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.640
need to be very exact and that reminded

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.079
me of here a lot where we draw

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:43.400
distinctions so that we are at least on

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.480
the same page but then we see very

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.440
quickly or I saw very quickly this coar

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.119
grained language thing and it

00:38:54.119 --> 00:38:58.520
doesn't often help at all

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:05.119
and for some reason I still want to say

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:08.720
and express this experience of listening

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.240
to her poetry it's cool poetry

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.240
that's very cool anyway that's all I

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.400
have to say at the moment thank

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.640
you yeah in her big book she talks a lot

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.920
about I haven't read it all yet a lot

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.119
about world

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:27.760
wordlessness that

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.400
philosophers biggest challenge is that

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.240
they're always operating on just just on

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.960
this edge of

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.960
wordlessness

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.640
um so I'm not I'm not trying to make

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.680
janza wikii like our you know leader or

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.040
anything like that

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.960
um just using her

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.440
her method

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.680
really

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.720
um her approach her way has a lot to do

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.200
with what we've been doing and you know

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.480
I only recently discovered

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.480
her um

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.000
and it's nice

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.960
to be able to draw on a body of work

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.680
that's already there to to play with and

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.359
stuff you know

00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:26.920
um

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.280
because For Me lyric lyric culture is

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.560
lyric philosophy plus something like

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.680
waren Heidi's uh

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.599
attending as an art or attending as a

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:42.760
sacred art

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.440
times David hinton's wild mind wild

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.359
Earth um so those three things together

00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:52.920
to me make lyric lyric

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.880
culture lyric philosophy attending as a

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.599
sacred act

00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:01.200
and um whatever you want to call the

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.920
third one W way

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.680
or being inside the six Extinction event

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.160
something and I would say that that

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.440
that's lyric

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.440
culture

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.400
um and you know that's how 20124 is set

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.560
out if you if you go to the Retreats but

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.800
also um the posts and the

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.760
the reflections and the briefs will be

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.280
based upon Warren hi h

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.480
i I don't know how to say his last

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.920
name I can find it really

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.800
fast it's also

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.040
um as a

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.560
art um no that's not

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.560
good it's also listed on the Retreat

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.720
website as the resource for the second

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.079
Retreat yeah I wanted to ask sort of

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:20.160
about like bringing it sort of back to

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.680
egregor yeah let's do that yeah because

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.680
we're talking about music and Harmony

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.119
but sometimes times things are not super

00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:30.720
harmonious and the music isn't so great

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.760
like I remember um chanting one time in

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.559
this Temple and there was this one woman

00:42:36.559 --> 00:42:39.760
who just chanted so loud like so so loud

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.400
that you no one else could hear like and

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.359
it sort of threw everyone off because

00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:48.119
and you know she wasn't aware of it um

00:42:48.119 --> 00:42:51.000
but just sort of you know how to shift

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.760
or how to respond when the music is

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.800
someone's maybe toned deaf or like it's

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.240
not moving in a harmonious

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.640
Direction so what's interesting what zi

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.160
does in her big book is she has her two

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.960
big books is she has something on the

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.400
left hand side that she writes that

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.960
sounds like her and then something on

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.480
the right- hand side which is analytic

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.559
philosophy and she challenges the reader

00:43:17.559 --> 00:43:19.720
to say how do these two

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.240
things go

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.960
together

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.599
um and it's not easy

00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:28.440
I mean I pride myself on someone who

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.559
could answer these puzzles and I'm like

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:33.440
what you know like so it's not like

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:37.359
she's she's trying to

00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:42.520
be utopian or Kumbaya person

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.240
um but the notion of the agore if we're

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.920
going to move on to that is really

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.800
fascinating

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.559
because

00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:55.079
um when we look at the origins of

00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:57.079
culture

00:43:57.079 --> 00:44:00.079
and when we think about new culture

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:04.480
emerging cultures or or new unfolding

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.119
cultures we think of culture as creating

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:14.079
a wi space right so like um people

00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:16.240
understand themselves as a people as the

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:20.680
Jewish people or as Irish people um um

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.040
and early on before the modern era those

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.280
were not related to States they were

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.359
related to ancestry right so culture has

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:33.160
to do with creating these larger and

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.800
larger units of

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.800
identity

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:45.599
um creating a we space and a we

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.640
space um depending on you how you

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:52.000
describe it but for me what a we is as

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.200
opposed to an us so an us is like a

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.079
category us

00:44:58.079 --> 00:45:00.640
Americans you know we're we go off in

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.440
all different directions but a we is

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:07.839
like a team we

00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:14.920
won the game right um but um and some

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.559
people will say you know we Americans we

00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:20.880
won the war I don't experience that as

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.520
like we won the War I experience as like

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.520
us Americans won the war yet again or us

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.960
Americans started the war right so for

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:34.359
me we has this capacity to be a unit of

00:45:35.319 --> 00:45:37.760
action and this is kind of the Holy

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.520
Grail of these practices how do you

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.240
create a culture where people are

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.040
coherent or resonant enough that they

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.000
can act

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.520
collaboratively at scales that can

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.240
change the

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.359
system

00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:57.319
right so um this is a question for a lot

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:00.680
of people and if you've tried to do

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.800
alternative things you find that you

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.000
even acting at a scale of five or six

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
people is really hard it's really hard

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.440
to make so Jonathan rousson calls it the

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.760
impossible

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.440
we like how many how much effort's gone

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.800
into like the emerge and the de in

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.440
development people and all these efforts

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:25.119
to and gain be and blah blah blah all

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:30.559
these efforts to create a we and by we I

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:32.720
mean is not an us not just people that

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.839
identify with game be it's an us I'm a

00:46:35.839 --> 00:46:39.280
card carrying game be or

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.720
whatever um

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.559
but the kind of glue that makes it a

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:47.200
unit of

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.200
action so this is this is something

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.960
people have been experimenting with and

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.200
working on for a long time you might

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.280
find it hard to make your own family a

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.280
unit of action these days one's a

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.160
Republicans some are Democrats this one

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.559
marries a financial person and and you

00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:07.839
can't you can't act together

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.839
anymore but having said that on the

00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:15.599
global scale we are a huge unit of

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.760
action we

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.920
we extract resources we have these

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:23.640
Global Supply chains we have these

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.079
Global uh geopolitical systems and we do

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:31.800
this without any effort we become this

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.520
huge we if you're you know if you're

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.040
like another animal and you're looking

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.000
at the human species they're like a

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.520
we're like a swarm of ants that is

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.559
really really really coordinated and

00:47:43.559 --> 00:47:46.760
active and powerful and

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.960
destructive we are without trying a huge

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.760
Wei it's just not the we anyone wants to

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:56.280
be or do we want to be this is the big

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.760
conundrum of all these experiments

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.400
everyone's trying to become a we and not

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.440
realizing that should how we need to

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.720
understand that we are a we and it's so

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.599
Insidious we don't even have to try to

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:12.440
be a wee we can even try not to be a we

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.359
and we're part of that unit of action so

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.160
if you're interested in creating wi

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.280
spaces you have to come to terms with

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.680
this

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.640
paradox

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.839
I have a question for you because of

00:48:36.839 --> 00:48:38.960
your

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.520
dogs

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:44.200
um yeah um so a friend of mine who lives

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.200
on a penthouse but there's no

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.960
elevator um has this huge great thing

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.880
that has decided that's it I'm not going

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.599
up those stairs

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.799
and so Lucy that's her name she's

00:49:01.799 --> 00:49:06.040
staying with me now so he's got this 200

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.559
square meter Penthouse I've got this

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:11.559
little Studio but the only place in the

00:49:11.559 --> 00:49:14.280
village where this dog could be is in my

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.440
studio so there's been this really

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.640
interesting kind of thing happening

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:26.680
right and um in contemplating Lucy who's

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.920
had the grace to accept

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:33.599
me you know like we get that this is

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:36.640
where she can live right

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.799
now um it struck me how all dogs came

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:42.880
from

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.119
wolves and I remember this Bruno tour

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:49.359
lecture where he put this slide of like

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:52.880
what we've done to dogs for the sake of

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.079
having a domestic companion

00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:59.480
we've bred all these kinds of

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.280
weirdnesses and and this great dane you

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:08.040
know her back legs are you know inbred

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.119
anomaly that's why it's not only her

00:50:10.119 --> 00:50:12.640
back legs their hearts are too small so

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.640
their back legs give out first yeah

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.400
exactly so it just struck me that you

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.160
know without talking about any moral

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.440
judgments just the fact that we've

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.559
manipulated a wolf's jeans to this

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:32.000
extent from the chaha to the Great

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.960
Dane it it just kind of creeped me out

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.520
you know that I mean how much effort how

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.839
much experimentation has gone into all

00:50:43.839 --> 00:50:46.240
this inbreeding for the

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.240
sake of having a

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.520
pet and I mean it was an outrage I

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.359
hadn't really felt before at our own

00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:02.640
species you know and our I mean of

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:04.400
course we do that with tomatoes and

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:07.960
chickens and pigs and everything

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:13.480
else people but you know these dogs just

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:18.520
give you like this crazy ass loyalty you

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.119
know

00:51:20.119 --> 00:51:24.359
um that we can't seem to muster you know

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:27.599
disloyalty without submission I mean

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:29.119
that's how I feel

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:33.359
it and oh she said something when I said

00:51:33.359 --> 00:51:35.599
that

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.760
um you know and and I'm also being

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.000
initiated into like pallative care

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.160
because her back legs it's so hard for

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.319
her to get up that she poops a little

00:51:48.319 --> 00:51:51.480
bit when she gets up you know and of

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.520
course I'm just in the studio so I can

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.880
smell it and then I'm growing through

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.000
this whole thing in my head saying I'm

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.839
just conditioned to think that this is a

00:52:01.839 --> 00:52:04.559
bad smell stop it you know just get up

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:07.480
deal with it you know and and and it's

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.880
like this whole dispositionality is

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.680
being tested oh my God like you know

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:20.000
into like put putri action okay and and

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.079
I like it I mean I like the challenge

00:52:23.079 --> 00:52:26.040
you know like it feels right for the

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.040
time to be tested at that level and I

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.599
guess that's kind of what I'm um

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:40.839
embracing honestly in the adventure of

00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:43.200
dispositionality not as some kind of

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.599
formula but as an adventure I mean how

00:52:46.599 --> 00:52:50.720
far can you take this in this

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.319
deconditioning of what's acceptable

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:56.480
what's not great thing to run

00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.200
experiments like this like you both

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.720
realize it's not the whole but it's a

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.119
very very interesting Adventure or

00:53:04.119 --> 00:53:08.520
experiment to run you learn a lot

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.119
from these experiments that

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.880
that yeah my whole life is kind of like

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.079
one of those weird that kind of

00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:27.160
experiment um

00:53:30.839 --> 00:53:33.480
now do you think that could catch on as

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.720
an

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:38.119
egregor well okay this is the question

00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:40.640
what is what makes an EG what makes it a

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.079
catch on what are the components that

00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:46.960
make people move at

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.720
scale and I mean we talked about them

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.640
last time there were the four

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.200
components and what you realize if you

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.839
can if you can

00:53:58.839 --> 00:54:02.119
infect all you know if you can if you

00:54:02.119 --> 00:54:06.160
can be effective in all four

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.040
components

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.839
um then you

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.520
can then the system will run itself

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.640
right so this reminds me of something

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.680
when I first met Nora Bates and she had

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.079
this theory of of change or

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:27.359
whatever and the where she she got a

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:30.079
grant to run the theory in a mental

00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:31.520
institution where they worked with

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.200
addicts because she's like what makes

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.319
people addicted like if you get people

00:54:36.319 --> 00:54:38.880
addicted to the right thing you know or

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.839
it's kind of like asking that question

00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:43.079
what makes

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:46.480
us able to coordinate at such a large

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.599
global

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:50.440
scale um

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:54.720
and and figure out that and but use it

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.839
to different a different purpose you

00:54:56.839 --> 00:54:59.440
know the the pro problem is does it only

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.880
work if you're destructive and then if

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.119
you want to uh have a culture that

00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:09.400
creates more life it doesn't work like

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.839
is that is that the case I mean I don't

00:55:12.839 --> 00:55:15.119
know it's it's an interesting

00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:17.200
question but I think we have to come to

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.640
the fact that without effort were this

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.160
huge powerful unit on the face of the

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.359
Earth and we and

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:32.200
and it's there to tell us like like what

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.680
are the components of being a huge

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.799
powerful we on the

00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:40.880
earth um instead of only thinking like

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.520
we're try you know we have to have all

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.599
these ex exotic psycho Technologies to

00:55:45.599 --> 00:55:50.280
become a Wei we need to learn what is

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.400
what is already this huge powerful thing

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.480
that makes us this huge powerful

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.559
we and somehow reproduce that to

00:56:00.559 --> 00:56:02.960
different

00:56:12.079 --> 00:56:14.520
purpose I mean some people would answer

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.400
that in a very easy way it's because

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.760
people are greedy so if you design this

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.799
thing around greed then people become a

00:56:21.799 --> 00:56:23.640
huge powerful

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.160
weat um is that the answer I don't think

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:31.599
so um yeah but what what is greediness

00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:34.200
though exactly then that then you would

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.760
you would want to look at that like why

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.280
is so but some people would say that you

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:44.359
know some people would say but

00:56:45.799 --> 00:56:49.799
but yeah but for example white head has

00:56:49.799 --> 00:56:51.920
this great I'm not going to say it right

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.960
but it's something like uh it's in the

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.680
adventure of ideas that that peace can

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.400
be

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.039
easily

00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:04.720
um

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.920
perverted by its

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.520
aberation which is

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.839
anesthesia and I think consumerism was a

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:18.319
form of collective

00:57:18.319 --> 00:57:23.400
anesthesia coming out of the you know

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.880
knowing that we were capable

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.079
of Exterminating ourselves after the

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:33.200
atomic bomb as a collective unconscious

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.839
I mean I think we give ourselves too

00:57:35.839 --> 00:57:39.839
much of an illusion of individual agency

00:57:39.839 --> 00:57:43.240
you know that we are in an agregar all

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.480
the time I

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.039
mean and that we've created this myth of

00:57:51.039 --> 00:57:52.400
um the

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.920
individual and that's sort of of what

00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.319
anesthetizes us from I mean what's that

00:58:00.319 --> 00:58:04.640
fungus that falls on an ant and takes

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.359
over its

00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:10.839
neural um thing and makes

00:58:10.839 --> 00:58:15.599
it shortcuts their pro-social thing and

00:58:15.599 --> 00:58:18.280
makes the ant just gather more food to

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.119
feed the fungus until the fungus like

00:58:20.119 --> 00:58:23.720
breaks through its head

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.000
um I forget the name of it but it's very

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.680
curious

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.760
thing and I I I feel

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.440
like it's been this erroneous

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.960
exceptionalism about the human that

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.359
somehow is created in the image of a God

00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:43.680
and therefore not part of everything

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.839
else and and so we don't even we can't

00:58:47.839 --> 00:58:51.400
onto epically conceive of ourselves as

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:56.720
as being parasitical as being you know

00:58:56.799 --> 00:59:01.280
um not the captains of our soul you know

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.400
whatever that is um and I think that

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.280
with this connectivity with this melan

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.200
age we have an opportunity to actually

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.039
see that I mean I'm sure you know him

00:59:15.039 --> 00:59:17.559
Bonita Patrick Ryan you know because he

00:59:17.559 --> 00:59:20.240
shows up at the sto yeah you know what I

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.440
was wondering I'm looking at Marie and r

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.920
ray I'm wondering if the Italians have

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:27.520
concept of the

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:34.000
aggregor like do they worry about the

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.319
egregor ask about their concept of

00:59:48.119 --> 00:59:50.319
pizza I don't

00:59:50.319 --> 00:59:53.640
know I don't know are we

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.720
there we

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.720
there

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:04.920
yeah yeah I don't I don't know I don't

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.520
know I I know that they that I

01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:15.000
experience um at least the Italians that

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.920
I'm around I experience them as a very

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.400
very different group that moves together

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.359
than I

01:00:23.359 --> 01:00:26.320
do with people that I hang out with back

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.440
[Music]

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.079
home the culture has a different way of

01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:33.799
moving around I don't think anybody can

01:00:33.799 --> 01:00:34.920
hear

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.520
us are we Frozen no we can hear you

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.359
frozen you said the culture moves around

01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:44.559
differently oh

01:00:44.559 --> 01:00:47.200
okay yeah they move they're they're in

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.680
relationship with with one another

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.079
different sorry about that this is a

01:00:53.079 --> 01:00:56.240
makeshift thing here

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.119
there yeah it's it's I don't you guys

01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:01.640
get deported and you're in like a cell

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640
now or

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.119
something the Italians put you in some

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:09.000
kind of detention center

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.599
did correct well it it actually might be

01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:15.039
worth telling um

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:21.520
Sandy Sandy said it um we're on a pizza

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
pilgrimage um we're we're in a place

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.039
called

01:01:26.039 --> 01:01:30.680
Kazo and uh there's a guy here that's a

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.760
third

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.400
generation

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.039
pizza maker and he broke off from the

01:01:37.039 --> 01:01:41.520
family because he decided that pizza

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.280
didn't have to be like a peasant food

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.359
and he wanted to make it something else

01:01:47.359 --> 01:01:51.039
and so he just kept experimenting and he

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:55.319
spent 12 years experimenting and it it

01:01:55.319 --> 01:01:58.640
cost him his marriage it cost him his

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.680
family broke off from his brothers

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:04.720
everything and and he's created

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.599
something and so uh we came here we got

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:12.440
off on the train this is um we're not

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.319
near anything but um like you yeah it's

01:02:17.319 --> 01:02:20.240
an old village on a hill and you get off

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.480
the train and and and you just like

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.000
follow the people they're all coming

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.599
here for the pizza and it's like this I

01:02:28.599 --> 01:02:32.559
I I mean this one guy has

01:02:32.559 --> 01:02:37.480
revitalized this this Village this town

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.960
that has gained this International

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.799
reputation

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:45.680
for pizza and and and it's it's a

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.680
medieval town it's yeah medieval town on

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.000
a hill and he he's

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.720
engaged um you guys are all all the

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.960
local farmers

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.640
yeah for us you're you're you're Frozen

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.319
no no you're good you're good has a very

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:02.520
smile on her face you're

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.599
good um anyway so so yeah just like I

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:11.640
mean it's been it's it it it's very

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.440
provocative in thinking about this

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.480
experience in relationship to trying to

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.839
like make change happen in the world

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:24.799
like he wasn't trying to create in the

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:28.119
Middle East or do any Grand Endeavor he

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:31.880
just loved pizza and and he's like

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:36.359
there's airbnbs all over this town and

01:03:36.359 --> 01:03:40.640
um he sources all the the ingredients

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.319
for his pizzas from local farmers and

01:03:45.319 --> 01:03:49.200
and it just has so many Ripple effects

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.319
from this simple thing and it's it's

01:03:52.319 --> 01:03:54.799
incredibly elegant at the same time

01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:58.720
it's very elegant so yeah

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.319
that's so I would say this is lyric

01:04:01.319 --> 01:04:03.680
culture because it's you you become

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:06.520
obsessed with the particular you know

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:08.920
what is the particular and you just you

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.799
just it's not about the global or the

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:16.920
the it it's it's these pockets of

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:22.240
particularity and um

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.760
um which answers to me answers the

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.839
egregor question it's it's the pursuit

01:04:28.839 --> 01:04:33.839
of of culture at scale is a distortion

01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:36.440
it it is what turns culture into

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:40.200
evil this we've been at it for you know

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.680
15,000 years culture only moves into

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.200
larger fewer and fewer types and larger

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.240
and larger scale and at a certain point

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.240
it's an the inflection point it culture

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.720
becomes uh

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:59.680
renic um so if you had more people you

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.319
know so here he's he if you have more

01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:05.319
people following

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:08.039
peculiarities you would have a different

01:05:08.039 --> 01:05:10.680
type of

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.119
relationship you would have individuals

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:15.839
that were connected by their

01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:18.960
unique um gifts

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:21.720
versus by these

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.640
massive uh means by which people just do

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.319
what they're

01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:29.799
told it's it's palpable it was it's

01:05:29.799 --> 01:05:32.680
really inspiring to sort of Step into

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.960
the Ambiance of all

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:38.920
that it's the same with that film

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.160
100,000 beating Hearts the guy started

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.520
to farm differently now he's on Twitter

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.240
and he's on the TV was on Joe Rogan they

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.279
have a whole Community it's white white

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:51.520
out pastures and they've gone on to do

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.799
all kinds of things by one person's

01:05:55.799 --> 01:05:59.480
decision obl obligatory

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:04.359
vow um and I think that this is

01:06:04.359 --> 01:06:06.160
the the

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.119
Paradox because everybody's trying to

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.720
run culture

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.799
through rules of

01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:16.799
scale

01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:19.960
and um this just

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.720
reproduces Mass

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.200
Consciousness which becomes destructive

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.279
because it can be colonized by

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.000
power is there a way

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.559
that some I don't even know what to say

01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:46.480
group can create you know at huge scale

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.079
a

01:06:48.079 --> 01:06:52.000
real embracing of true

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.039
diversity you see the the challenge here

01:06:55.039 --> 01:06:59.359
or The Leverage is not in trying to

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:02.039
create something else another Goliath at

01:07:02.039 --> 01:07:04.640
scale that can fight the Goliath that's

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.559
there it's this people to stop paying

01:07:08.559 --> 01:07:11.200
attention to being part of what is what

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.279
scales and to spend their all their life

01:07:14.279 --> 01:07:18.119
in voluntary obligation to something in

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:21.279
particular spend all your life gardening

01:07:21.279 --> 01:07:23.319
and get a little job on the side if you

01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:24.680
have to

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.359
and then you don't you don't contribute

01:07:26.359 --> 01:07:30.599
to the thing but all the Consciousness

01:07:30.599 --> 01:07:32.880
even among young people want to change

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.760
the system is all let's build another

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.799
big system and what I'm saying it's a

01:07:36.799 --> 01:07:40.680
convivial tool is that that culture at

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.520
scale is

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.279
evil because to become culture at scale

01:07:47.279 --> 01:07:49.319
you have to swallow other cultures and

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:52.920
then mass mass condition

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.920
them

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:01.520
that cultures flourish when they they

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.480
they're allowed to diverse and divest

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:08.119
into their

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.839
particulars

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.120
and what are there there's only 200

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.040
Nations and everybody speaks English you

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.480
know there's like there's no there's no

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.319
cultures left there's just this big a

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:39.000
glutenous

01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.799
mass

01:08:59.159 --> 01:09:02.319
there are some cultures

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:05.359
left yes and I think there's a lot of

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:08.679
little emerging ones yeah yeah and

01:09:08.679 --> 01:09:12.040
there's ones that very often weaving

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:15.719
back into what we were talking about

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:19.759
before with the music um language is a

01:09:19.759 --> 01:09:20.600
type

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:25.120
of music it's a type of in

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.279
rment

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:31.400
um and I loved I loved what was said

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:36.560
about how you can notice how the Italian

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.279
culture sort of moves differently yes

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:43.799
and there is like a

01:09:43.799 --> 01:09:46.560
um there's a

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.640
body uh patterning movement patterning

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.480
to

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:55.920
culture um and some of that can be seen

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.320
in you know stereotypes that people make

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.880
but it's also kind of

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.640
a way way that people come to relate and

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.880
communicate on a body level

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.239
um yeah I'm I'm heading to Argentina to

01:10:13.239 --> 01:10:14.440
study the

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:18.600
tango and um I'm really excited to do

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.640
that because it's um it's really

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640
uh

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:27.360
a folk

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.360
dance that

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.679
originated in multip in a multiplicity

01:10:32.679 --> 01:10:33.679
of

01:10:33.679 --> 01:10:36.159
diversity and there was a way of

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:38.080
relating to one another that crossed

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.600
language

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.719
removement especially for people who had

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:45.159
left family and felt

01:10:45.159 --> 01:10:46.679
lonely

01:10:46.679 --> 01:10:50.719
um and at it at its core is the embrace

01:10:50.719 --> 01:10:51.880
the the

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.199
hug um

01:10:54.199 --> 01:10:57.120
which hearkens back once again

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.000
to being held by by a caregiver at the

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.360
very beginning heart tohe heart so this

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.760
isced to be ENT trained in that culture

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.920
yeah no this is a big Insight because if

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.320
you think

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.960
about um if you think about a lot of

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.600
them some of the Mediterranean

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.080
cultures um some of the a lot of the

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:24.880
resistance that comes from like France

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.520
Italy Greece is that the people

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.360
literally refuse to move a certain way

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.960
like you know if you're like a big Tech

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.840
startup and stuff you want to see people

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.320
moving right and it's like it's like

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.760
just their

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.000
physical drag from this mod you know

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.040
you're like they they're so slow Manana

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.840
like this whole this whole thing is very

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.960
politically very very positive you know

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:58.040
resistance just the refusal to move your

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.600
body in a certain way is very powerful

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.840
resistance I mean anyone that's been

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.520
trying to teach high school kids and

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.719
then you know come on we gotta go here

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:09.280
and then they just their bodies just

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.880
they just don't Roberta is laughing do

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.920
you know but this is this is you know

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.480
then of course it gets the activist

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.440
going they won't they just lay down and

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:21.440
stuff like this but in the everyday life

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.480
this a very powerful if you learn to

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.960
move differently if you learn to move

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.520
your body in different ways this becomes

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.159
an act of resistance just naturally I

01:12:32.159 --> 01:12:36.120
would say that that is a

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.600
big a big part of cultural change is

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.639
exactly what what you just said um it's

01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:45.400
not trivial it's

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.400
fundamental

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.600
um

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.440
yeah

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.199
are you saying we should get out of our

01:13:08.199 --> 01:13:11.880
chairs when you start your

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:22.360
playlist I don't know what I'm

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.360
saying

01:13:50.199 --> 01:13:52.159
but the concept of Igor is really

01:13:52.159 --> 01:13:55.639
interesting and and how has

01:13:57.159 --> 01:14:00.400
to be

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.280
understood

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.120
just um going going back to um how when

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.320
systems become too large they

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.000
lose some of the

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.920
essence um

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.840
I'm I've observed I've been practicing

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.480
Tango for a while and um it's very it's

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.400
wonderful there are a lot of beautiful

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.880
great things about it

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.760
it um and it also has moved away from

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.639
its Essence which add its Essence was a

01:15:01.639 --> 01:15:02.679
community

01:15:02.679 --> 01:15:05.040
dance where children danced with aunts

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.760
and uncles and

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.840
grandparents it wasn't just about being

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.719
sexy even though it's great to be sexy

01:15:11.719 --> 01:15:16.040
but it was about Community Connection

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.719
and a witness a circle of

01:15:18.719 --> 01:15:22.199
witnesses holding space for the

01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:25.520
interpersonal connection of the

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.080
community you know similar to break

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:30.360
dancing at its roots and now of course

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.520
ex captured yeah this that's right the

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.320
scene and the youth and the development

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.480
of it um and the

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:46.800
performance um yeah

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.800
um these are all things to look at in

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.360
terms of

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.320
like how things natur

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.400
emerge um we can learn from them they're

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.600
still in the human

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.480
system

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.960
and I think trying

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.040
to I mean I think it odd psycho

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.719
Technologies are important you can learn

01:16:09.719 --> 01:16:14.840
a lot from them but I think they

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.679
they I think they're too Fringe I think

01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:23.520
there's an answer right in the the heart

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.800
of who we are as humans right in the

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.719
heart of what culture is and how it has

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.960
and always has sustained

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.000
itself

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.920
um and a lot of the psycho Technologies

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.480
I think are to break the old habits you

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.080
know but I don't think they're

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.800
necessarily

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.920
templates this is something I an illich

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.360
would say you know most of religion now

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.600
should be people eating around the table

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.040
friends you know uh and

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.040
so

01:17:02.679 --> 01:17:05.040
um I mean that's this is the

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.000
conversation we're having today like

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.560
there's there's something

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:12.199
in our default mode that's actually very

01:17:12.199 --> 01:17:18.960
valuable that can help us um and

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.080
um yeah that's why I love what Marie and

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.199
and Ry said like something as how could

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:31.400
something as transformative as

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.280
pizza or you

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.560
know there are kiosks in parts of the

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.360
city that are like that they've been

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.040
around um I'm not sure in America but

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.280
there's some in in

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.239
Japan that have been around for six or

01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:53.660
seven

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:55.480
[Music]

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:58.400
generations and people get married on

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.440
the street around these kiosks

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:10.000
and something like that's very very

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.440
important to study

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.679
also that you know these aren't Fringe

01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:17.679
things these are Timeless kinds of kind

01:18:17.679 --> 01:18:20.280
of things that then when you try to do

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.800
them again they look Fringe right

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.320
because it's like who does that anymore

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.480
right so that they can look bizarre when

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:31.760
they're resurrected inside Modern Life

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.040
but these are interesting questions

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.159
about the human

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:42.239
condition and anyways lyric

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:45.280
culture she she she talks a lot about

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.280
Domesticity in this way has a it can

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.760
feel like a

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.920
throwback

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.920
um

01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.080
the solution can feel so trivial and so

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.080
simple that you're almost too

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.120
embarrassed to suggest it like you know

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.840
like I want to revolutionize pizza or

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.440
whatever and then you find that the

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:13.199
certain kind of energy can draw in can

01:19:13.199 --> 01:19:15.560
transform an Old Village you know and

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.600
can remake society

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.600
and

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.320
yeah but I agree with you there's a lot

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.000
of that kind of stuff happening not

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.639
everyone not every initiative gets

01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:32.800
viral on YouTube and then gets like a

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.000
bunch of airbnbs around it but I think

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.480
that having a strong Center could be an

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.920
educational thing it could be a a farm

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:49.080
thing it could be a dance Community um

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.920
as a center um and then operate along

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.159
some of these convivial ways of being

01:19:55.159 --> 01:19:58.120
these trust networks and yeah building

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.560
it out from there I think this these

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.120
things are

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.760
possible

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.560
Bonnie I thought I saw catala raise her

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.159
hand maybe it was

01:20:40.199 --> 01:20:43.679
inadvertent you may be

01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:54.719
oppression

01:21:38.239 --> 01:21:39.800
you know one of the things that is

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.520
common with if you think of the

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:47.480
Jazz culture as it emerges or this pizza

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.800
culture

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:51.960
um they're they're certainly not

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.600
established

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.520
on the premise to make money I mean over

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.000
time they become you know co-opted in

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000
big deals and stuff but

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.840
um people just make sacri they they're

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.400
just so in love with the pursuit of

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.080
something um and as you guys said and if

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.600
you take a really hard right turn into

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.679
being

01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:18.960
that in love with a pursuit of something

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.199
then you like JK Rollins you know you

01:22:22.199 --> 01:22:24.560
get really poor and you your

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.920
relationships suffer all these all these

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.600
standard ways of being actually stuer

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.800
suffer and

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.560
um

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.159
there's a lot of Secrets too you're

01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:10.159
never gonna find out how he makes his

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:13.679
pizza I hope you realize

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.480
this

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.159
yeah that's actually that's really

01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:30.520
interesting I've been working at Joe for

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.199
a couple of years now and I've learned a

01:23:32.199 --> 01:23:35.520
little bit and then eating this eating

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.719
this guy's food I realized that there's

01:23:37.719 --> 01:23:41.360
no way not only can I learn it I don't

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.840
want to learn

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.159
it it's like I don't want to own

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:49.360
that it it was such a gift to be on the

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.480
receiving end of

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.480
it

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.159
and a lot of those what's in common with

01:24:01.159 --> 01:24:03.120
a lot of these things is you know bread

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:06.120
is complex because it it's if it's yeast

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.960
based it's a it's alive I mean you're

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.600
working with a living

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.199
system and these people they they wine

01:24:15.199 --> 01:24:19.840
is the same way they relate to the life

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.360
force of the

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.360
thing

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.719
which is subject to responsiveness to

01:24:27.719 --> 01:24:31.320
the environment you know and and the way

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.080
you move your hands and on and on and on

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.040
and

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.040
on

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.880
um

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.360
yeah

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:11.440
you hear that dog crying in the

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.760
background oh

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.920
good he's on the porch and he wants to

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.760
go in the house and Sandy can't hear him

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:30.040
so he sounds like he sounds like this is

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.719
poor abused animal outside my

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.880
window Bonnie are you back in your

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.360
studio

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.360
yes yes I have a whole new setup so

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.159
we're gonna have some fun things I'm

01:25:47.159 --> 01:25:51.520
trying to set it up so we can have like

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.719
a half it won't be here it'll be over

01:25:53.719 --> 01:25:55.600
there and there'll be like because I

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.239
have all these visitors coming in

01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:59.520
November and that we could have some

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.239
sessions where we stream live to the

01:26:03.239 --> 01:26:04.400
popup

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.199
school um so you I can't do it now

01:26:07.199 --> 01:26:08.639
because I'm not sure I to do it but this

01:26:08.639 --> 01:26:12.639
camera can go whyde can you know have

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:14.440
see around I'm trying to make a little

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:20.119
schedule huh so so

01:26:20.119 --> 01:26:24.440
um yeah that's trying to set it up um it

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.679
was very frustrating trying to set up

01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:29.880
this station because it's it's powered

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.840
by a Microsoft Surface Pro which is a

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.480
pretty good

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.440
processor um but it's old generation so

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.600
all the the hookups and the ports are

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.679
different I mean it was just crazy

01:26:43.679 --> 01:26:46.840
how how how many things I bought that

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.639
were wrong which is fine you just send

01:26:48.639 --> 01:26:52.880
them back but um I'm still um in need of

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.520
one other cable and one other external

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.760
speaker um but I've been trying to set

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:00.199
it up

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.520
so um we can have live stream events

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:10.159
from here uh for the popup

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.920
school so we do have quite a few

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.639
visitors coming in November

01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:24.119
um

01:27:34.679 --> 01:27:36.560
it's all right I'd like to Loop all the

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.400
way back to something that came up when

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.280
Melina was talking about Lucy the great

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.679
danne and mentioned that you know in

01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:49.360
addition to dogs you know humans have

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.000
bred chickens and tomatoes and and you

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.440
popped in with humans and I was just

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.480
curious if you would elaborate on what

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:00.960
you

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.679
meant um well I think what we are

01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:06.440
talking about is kind of

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.760
making distorting the

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:14.040
natural the Natural Evolution of

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.360
animals um uh selectively distorting

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.800
well we can I can go from more concrete

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:26.800
to more abstract so for example um what

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.520
when you wage war on an indigenous

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.360
population you get rid of all the uh

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.560
most powerful men

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.960
first and you end up with a passive

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.520
population the opposite is happening in

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:47.080
Palestine because what's happening in

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.199
Palestine is you're selecting for

01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:52.760
radicalized population

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.239
because early on the the peaceful people

01:28:55.239 --> 01:28:58.159
leave and over time the population gets

01:28:58.159 --> 01:29:00.040
more

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.199
radicalized it's just it's just a law of

01:29:04.199 --> 01:29:07.800
nature um so there's a lot of policies

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:12.000
uh on a a geopolitical scale that

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.400
um selectively breed there's a famous

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:21.159
study in London about um this this about

01:29:21.159 --> 01:29:22.679
bringing in

01:29:22.679 --> 01:29:25.679
immigrants and if you have immigrants

01:29:25.679 --> 01:29:29.760
and and they don't they don't um

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.480
integrate well in the neighborhood the

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.840
worst thing you can do is put up a wall

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:35.480
if you put up a wall the the

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.600
neighborhoods become more violent they

01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.400
they become more violent to each other

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.159
so there's there's there's a lot of uh

01:29:45.159 --> 01:29:47.320
the prison population in the US is a

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.400
selective breeding

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.239
program uh Reagan's war on drug drugs

01:29:52.239 --> 01:29:54.719
was a selective breeding

01:29:54.719 --> 01:29:57.840
program um basically to have more and

01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:03.480
more pacified um pacified citizenship uh

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.239
China's very good at selective breeding

01:30:07.239 --> 01:30:08.960
uh programs better than the us because

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.480
they have much more of a centralized

01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:13.040
government and we have Texas you know

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:16.000
Texas is like they're crazy

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.840
right um

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.520
so

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.600
um um so the Distortion so we so this

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.440
distinction between the nature of mind

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.440
and the kinds of Minds we have have so

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.199
we have the nature of our minds is human

01:30:33.199 --> 01:30:35.400
mind but the kinds of Minds we have

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.880
today has been selectively B bred into

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.760
us

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.840
um so

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:49.280
um

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.840
yeah

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.440
the kinds of diets we have

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.920
today hormon you know hormones and the

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:06.800
all this stuff um like what a big big

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.760
selective breeding program on the west

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:16.560
is um the um obesity and diab diabetes

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.600
problem it's not natural no one

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.440
understands it people there's if it's

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.960
not because it's you know there's so

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.199
many correlations and there's this huge

01:31:29.199 --> 01:31:36.040
huge multi-year huge Cross Research

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.119
metaanalysis um that's very important

01:31:40.119 --> 01:31:42.320
because get

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:46.520
this the wild animals are getting fatter

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:49.000
too so first they noticed the animals in

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.360
the zoos and they were like okay

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.520
processed food blah blah blah the wild

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.000
animals are getting fatter

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.920
too so this

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.239
metaanalysis the two top things they

01:31:59.239 --> 01:32:03.520
think is um obesity in animal

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.000
populations and humans is always

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.080
associated with lower latitudes

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.960
altitudes and the and the lower

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.880
watersheds there's so many

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:20.840
anti-depressants in in in the water and

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.480
steroids in the water so people that

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:24.520
have go on

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:27.880
anti-depressants get fat people who take

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.320
steroids get fat animal farm animal

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.760
steroids that's why they give farm

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.960
animal steroids and antibiotics because

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.119
it produces weight so the problem the

01:32:37.119 --> 01:32:39.600
epidemic is because in the Watershed is

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.560
what they believe now so you go on and

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.679
on and on about public policy and you

01:32:44.679 --> 01:32:46.679
got the diet pills and you got the fight

01:32:46.679 --> 01:32:48.360
the people who are arguing againsts and

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.080
then youve got the African-Americans

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.800
that happen to be in the low water shed

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.320
you got all this

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:56.560
 and it's not any of those things

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:59.480
it's a very very multi-dimensional

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:04.159
complex problem that is environmental at

01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:07.119
scale so that's selective breeding the

01:33:07.119 --> 01:33:09.719
the the the culture selectively breeds

01:33:09.719 --> 01:33:12.600
for obese

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.199
diabetic people like a sharpi like

01:33:16.199 --> 01:33:18.800
Sharpes you know they have really bad

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.639
they're a kind of a dog and they have

01:33:20.639 --> 01:33:22.480
really bad skin problem because they

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:27.080
have like folds and folds and folds of

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:30.600
skin and pugs can't breathe and they

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:31.719
can't have

01:33:31.719 --> 01:33:34.360
children because because they're so

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.400
deformed so these are these are with

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:42.040
animals uh we breed for you know the

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:44.400
same way we build these

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:47.280
architectures that are buildings that

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:49.080
are not alive they're

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.760
anti-life um

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.880
these things are are not in service to

01:33:56.880 --> 01:33:58.400
life

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.400
they're

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.560
yeah so one thing I've added to my

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.080
dispositionality

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:10.679
Adventures um has

01:34:10.679 --> 01:34:14.800
been um this thing from Aaron Manning

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:18.080
was really taken on this notion of

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:22.400
neurot typicality as systemic not

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.639
individual I mean it's kind of a moving

01:34:25.639 --> 01:34:28.080
horizon line that's produced by every

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.360
era so to speak and I would say with

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:35.040
Alexander the paradigmatic of the

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.239
technology and

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:39.719
um

01:34:39.719 --> 01:34:42.000
neurodiversity

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.159
um as this exploration you know without

01:34:46.159 --> 01:34:49.920
comparison where I read this book called

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:53.639
Plankton Dreams by Au artistic author

01:34:53.639 --> 01:34:57.560
and I really recommend it because it was

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.199
90 Pages it was very

01:35:00.199 --> 01:35:03.159
transformative the main character is a

01:35:03.159 --> 01:35:06.880
boy who has to go to a special needs

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:10.000
program just to kind of help his mother

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.679
who is doing workshops to explain how

01:35:13.679 --> 01:35:17.719
she works with him and he knows what

01:35:17.719 --> 01:35:21.560
he's going to be facing and he sets

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:24.440
himself is only his own learning goals

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:28.960
and he says so why wouldn't an autistic

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.000
study neurot

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.520
typicality and and it's just beautifully

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.719
written with wonderful irony and

01:35:38.719 --> 01:35:43.159
satire and it just struck me that narot

01:35:43.159 --> 01:35:45.280
typicality as

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.920
a

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:52.040
um kind of almost moal you know like a

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:53.600
luggage

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.239
word could help us kind of understand

01:35:58.239 --> 01:36:00.760
how first all you can never be

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.960
neurotypical enough you know whatever

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:10.679
the context demands that n Ty to

01:36:10.679 --> 01:36:13.239
be and

01:36:13.239 --> 01:36:17.159
so in relating to each person like he

01:36:17.159 --> 01:36:22.040
says his name is Tito so he's Tito istic

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:24.600
and Eileen is

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.280
alistic and Bonita would be

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.800
bistic you know and it's I don't know if

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.560
I can

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.639
articulate the kind of metamorphosis

01:36:40.639 --> 01:36:44.480
that that played but it it it has

01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.639
allowed me because like the owner of

01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:49.880
Lucy is kind of what would be

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.760
conventionally called on the Spectrum

01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:57.119
he's kind of a polymath but you know you

01:36:57.119 --> 01:37:01.119
can't speak to him the same way as you

01:37:01.119 --> 01:37:04.280
would narot typically expect and you

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.679
know we've been so playful around this

01:37:06.679 --> 01:37:10.159
whole Lucy thing partially because I'm

01:37:10.159 --> 01:37:13.760
not expecting him to really understand

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.199
that for me to have this huge dog in my

01:37:16.199 --> 01:37:17.360
little

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:21.280
studio is not a neurotypical situation

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.280
and I'm having to be

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.960
neurodiverse to open up to that and in

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.360
that way I can have a different

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.199
conversation with him and then that

01:37:32.199 --> 01:37:34.639
changes the conversation of anybody else

01:37:34.639 --> 01:37:37.000
who asks me how are you putting up with

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.440
this situation of this dog that poops at

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:45.159
3:00 a.m. and whatever and and somehow

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:50.239
that entire kind of well with the bio

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:52.320
course that he's doing right now and

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.920
with Aaron Manning they've basically

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:59.280
come to this having narot typicality and

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:02.960
colonialism be one of the same

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.760
thing which of course keeps

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.639
morphing depending on whatever context

01:38:08.639 --> 01:38:14.760
you're in um so I don't know how in the

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:19.440
popup school that would play out but for

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.000
me it's been

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.960
really kind of infusing humor and

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.360
curiosity

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.599
and uh

01:38:31.599 --> 01:38:34.040
suspending these other ways where

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:36.920
entitlement sort of interferes with the

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.599
ability to engage with actually what's

01:38:40.599 --> 01:38:44.239
unfolding like what about me and you

01:38:44.239 --> 01:38:46.560
know who's thinking how this is

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.480
affecting me or whatever and it's like

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.239
who the cares you know the self

01:38:52.239 --> 01:38:55.800
construct anyway you

01:39:03.599 --> 01:39:06.560
know yeah I mean that's a whole another

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.599
thing I I I I'm hoping that

01:39:09.599 --> 01:39:14.080
bio he's I believe he'll be in

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:18.440
Massachusetts this year coming year

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:21.440
2024 and I'm hoping he'll bring his L

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.360
down to work with the

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.070
horses

01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:28.159
[Music]

01:39:28.159 --> 01:39:30.040
um we'll

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.560
see that would be great you know I mean

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:37.080
he brings in are you familiar bunny with

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.599
Fon D

01:39:41.639 --> 01:39:44.360
work no but I think there's a lot to

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:47.360
explore like with bio

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.800
like I wouldn't say I

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:55.760
agree with everywhere he's going with n

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.880
like colon like I like his Exile his

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.159
Sanctuary um this this this is a

01:40:03.159 --> 01:40:07.639
slippery slope for me to equate autism

01:40:07.639 --> 01:40:11.760
neurotypical non- neurotypical

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:14.760
colonialism

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.520
um this interesting to me but I I'm it

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.599
like I want I would I would like him to

01:40:24.599 --> 01:40:27.719
slow down like these are kind

01:40:27.719 --> 01:40:31.760
of yeah

01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.040
um I think

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:44.239
that I think that the envir you know the

01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:47.960
the the the cultural environment and the

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.920
physical environment is distorting

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:55.080
you know it's changing people's nervous

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.560
system and their

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.320
brains um I don't think we

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:04.719
can just say well that's good to think

01:41:04.719 --> 01:41:07.159
it's not good is just colonialism you

01:41:07.159 --> 01:41:09.880
know what I mean it's it's a little he's

01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:12.679
a little too sweeping but he's also a

01:41:12.679 --> 01:41:17.000
poet he's not really meant to be

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:21.760
read with this kind of lens that that

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.520
handy cuffs handcuffs him to literal

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.000
literality So my answer to that is why

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.880
don't you bring you know my answer was

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.520
why don't you bring them down to work

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:33.400
with the

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.719
horses uh there's a lot

01:41:35.719 --> 01:41:39.000
of uh literature on horses working with

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.239
autistic people I've worked with ADHD

01:41:43.239 --> 01:41:46.560
young people like pretty per bad you

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.239
know pretty severe um but I haven't

01:41:49.239 --> 01:41:52.090
worked with an autistic person

01:41:52.090 --> 01:41:53.760
[Music]

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.960
um so I think something like that could

01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.679
help open the

01:41:59.679 --> 01:42:05.119
expiration um but that being said if the

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:08.159
the generations are going through an

01:42:08.159 --> 01:42:10.080
environment

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.360
that's changing our brains then then we

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.760
have to

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:20.119
embrace those changes I mean we are We

01:42:20.119 --> 01:42:22.520
Are Who We Are

01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:25.880
are um if we have nuclear war and

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.840
everybody has like tumors and radiation

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.340
sickness and that's who we become we

01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.239
[Music]

01:42:35.239 --> 01:42:39.560
become what we interact with

01:42:40.599 --> 01:42:43.599
so

01:42:45.679 --> 01:42:49.040
yeah so you know I'm I'm

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:52.159
still this is a a very beautiful

01:42:52.159 --> 01:42:54.400
exploration and I'm and

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.880
I'm and you know I'm not sure where I

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:01.080
overlap and where I disagree or

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.400
something you know I don't I don't think

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:06.360
it's great that people are you know

01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.840
pretty soon 70% of the population will

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.159
be obese and have diabetes I don't I

01:43:12.159 --> 01:43:13.960
don't think that's good I don't think

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.320
that you can just say well to say it's

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.679
not good is just colonizing I just I

01:43:19.679 --> 01:43:21.280
just

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.080
no if that's what it is that's it is

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:26.159
that's who we are now but so I'm not

01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:28.280
saying to blame people I'm saying we

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:33.800
actually can't blame people um but I

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.360
think one of my favorite examples of

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.840
that is December

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.400
23rd

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.599
1973 hundreds of thousands of persons

01:43:46.599 --> 01:43:48.840
were declared

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.239
cured when

01:43:51.239 --> 01:43:54.199
the American Psychiatric association

01:43:54.199 --> 01:43:58.719
took homosexuality off the

01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:06.760
DSM yeah but I don't think this is a a

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.320
similar situation

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.760
because

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:15.760
homosexuality uh PE people related to

01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:18.199
homosexuality like it was a

01:44:18.199 --> 01:44:20.719
novel neuroatypical

01:44:20.719 --> 01:44:22.480
thing that happened

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.440
recently homosexuality has been

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.880
practiced by cultures Forever

01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.360
Until American Catholic protestantism

01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.280
declared it a sin I mean it's not like

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.119
and that was the mistake people thought

01:44:38.119 --> 01:44:40.639
oh the culture is getting so you know

01:44:40.639 --> 01:44:43.440
perverse and this and that but it was

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:46.040
only much more recently that it became a

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:48.880
problem than the fact that it was

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.159
happening right so

01:44:51.159 --> 01:44:54.320
so we're talking about autism is very

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.520
very

01:44:55.520 --> 01:44:59.080
recent truly a recent

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.040
phenomenon uh ADHD we don't know but

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:05.159
ADHD is something that could be more

01:45:05.159 --> 01:45:08.560
structural um but we don't know whereas

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.119
homosexuality was not a

01:45:11.119 --> 01:45:15.480
recent cultural emergence it it was the

01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:17.920
fact that people thought homosexuality

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.560
was weird was actually a recent

01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:26.599
invention a novel invention by Western

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:31.440
Catholics abortion is not a new fad

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:34.920
people have been infanti infanto what is

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.960
it called infanticide has been around in

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.320
cultures

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:41.280
forever so this is this

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.880
is you know what you see what I'm saying

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.880
there're these things are not new autism

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.599
I believe is quite or the or the the the

01:45:50.599 --> 01:45:52.920
incidence of obesity the incidence of

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.760
diabetes the incidence of autism is

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.639
new it's something

01:46:01.639 --> 01:46:05.400
new it just just is it's not something

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:08.119
we pretended wasn't in the human system

01:46:08.119 --> 01:46:10.719
for a long time and

01:46:10.719 --> 01:46:16.239
now uh we're changing our minds about

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.440
it yeah I can say I've

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:27.239
um you know dug deep into it but I've I

01:46:27.239 --> 01:46:30.000
don't know because of the monetization

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.960
of any kind of division whether it's

01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.520
along gender class race lines you know

01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:40.400
it's it's just automatic because of the

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.119
click and bait I mean it's not even like

01:46:43.119 --> 01:46:47.440
an ideological war it's just talk about

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.239
aggregor

01:46:49.239 --> 01:46:53.480
um and and so I found that this notion

01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:56.880
of neurot typicality as a

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.679
systemic way of designating a

01:47:01.679 --> 01:47:04.920
mechanism that

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.840
says this is good that's bad or in

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:16.199
degrees um might be a way to not fall

01:47:16.199 --> 01:47:18.480
into the

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:22.320
polarizations that are so

01:47:22.599 --> 01:47:27.000
exploited so easily in this agregan kind

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.360
of way that just pches like

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:34.040
toire I'm going to post in the in in the

01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:38.280
popup schroll an absolutely mindboggling

01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.480
performance of Kevin

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:46.239
spacy of um a piece from Shakespeare's

01:47:46.239 --> 01:47:50.400
um tus I think it's the name and and and

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.800
it's like Shakespeare and cancel culture

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.239
and I mean the man's been exonerated out

01:47:56.239 --> 01:47:59.360
of absolutely every

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:01.280
accusation every

01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.679
trial um declared innocent and yet you

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:08.560
know this is the first time he's really

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.960
invited to to to to to be present with

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.480
what he has to offer and it's really

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.760
really I had to watch it like three or

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.920
four times it was so powerful I'll post

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.920
it um but I I would like if you haven't

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.719
heard of him

01:48:29.719 --> 01:48:33.320
f um because this is you know he started

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.159
right after second world war um I I'll

01:48:37.159 --> 01:48:40.440
post something right now on him because

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:42.320
I I don't know I just have this

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.239
intuition that you're going to see

01:48:44.239 --> 01:48:49.360
something there that um connects with

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.000
some of the work you're

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.480
doing there's not a lot translated

01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.080
unfortunately but I think you'll get a

01:48:58.080 --> 01:48:59.920
sense

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:01.440
of

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:04.760
um because nobody was working with

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:07.639
autism you know

01:49:07.639 --> 01:49:10.960
1962 and he spent 30

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.480
years

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:18.199
with so-called autistic kids um without

01:49:18.199 --> 01:49:22.119
any of this institutional

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:25.880
um yeah I I think there's something and

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.599
I think you can probably pick something

01:49:28.599 --> 01:49:30.560
from this

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.560
that um I I don't

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:38.080
have it's not what I

01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:41.360
do I'm

01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:52.119
here I have something to say

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.679
say oh my God was that the same thing

01:49:55.679 --> 01:49:58.840
you were working on the other day yep oh

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.159
my God got little

01:50:01.159 --> 01:50:04.520
ears and uh it's

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.520
done that was fast I

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.400
mean well well it's not fast because you

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.639
had you were working forever to se it

01:50:12.639 --> 01:50:15.480
together it was intense because I

01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:18.320
whatever but anyways I finished the baby

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.040
hasn't come yet but

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.470
that's so

01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:27.360
[Music]

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:31.199
cute that would fit my

01:50:37.639 --> 01:50:42.040
dog my hood was way out of proportion

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.760
because it's a seed Stitch yeah and I

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:47.719
get I get kind of loose in the seed

01:50:47.719 --> 01:50:52.040
Stitch Department yeah

01:50:53.599 --> 01:50:57.320
anyways they liked it that's all that

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:59.639
matters how when's the due date pretty

01:50:59.639 --> 01:51:02.079
soon right tomorrow

01:51:02.079 --> 01:51:05.239
tomorrow yeah oh so right on time look

01:51:05.239 --> 01:51:08.520
at that

01:51:08.599 --> 01:51:11.520
yep y I just realized you could use

01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.760
these to knit well there you

01:51:16.079 --> 01:51:18.920
go I always can you hear that my mother

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.880
used to KN I just that that noise it's

01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:24.760
very comforting you would watch TV and

01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:27.040
she'd be

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.040
like

01:51:31.239 --> 01:51:33.639
yeah it's a funny thing because I

01:51:33.639 --> 01:51:36.520
thought it would be kind of a

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:40.040
mellow exercise kind of like put me in

01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:42.480
kind of an open space but it's actually

01:51:42.480 --> 01:51:45.400
a very linear exercise yeah and I

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:48.159
noticed that it it keeps me especially

01:51:48.159 --> 01:51:49.599
if I have a pattern that I'm trying to

01:51:49.599 --> 01:51:50.599
follow

01:51:50.599 --> 01:51:53.520
kind of keeps me in a focused place and

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:58.960
not a more diffused place so uh I it's a

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:01.400
it's a real

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:05.360
um gift of time to that kind of purpose

01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:08.000
yeah that's a discipline it's a

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.159
discipline

01:52:09.159 --> 01:52:11.480
yeah I don't know how much more knitting

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:14.119
I'm gonna do but it was really helpful

01:52:14.119 --> 01:52:15.520
to listen to

01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:18.400
matalina and to do this because I had to

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.520
redo the binding because I made it too

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:23.679
tight and because if if the conversation

01:52:23.679 --> 01:52:26.000
gets outside of what I can really fully

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.280
get yeah it gave me something to okay

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:33.119
I'm doing something that I understand

01:52:33.119 --> 01:52:35.440
here yeah and it's like it's like when

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:37.880
you're a kids and there's conversation

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:40.280
that you don't understand but the the

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.119
lyrical right the the there's something

01:52:43.119 --> 01:52:45.599
about

01:52:45.599 --> 01:52:49.079
hearing the adults laughing and then Qui

01:52:49.079 --> 01:52:50.760
you know there's something about it that

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.199
still is a transmission I would say that

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.119
was Kimberly was saying there's

01:52:55.119 --> 01:52:59.520
something very social about it um and in

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:02.920
fact uh we had this Workshop here a

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.880
couple of the end of last month and you

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.599
know I was really tired we worked really

01:53:08.599 --> 01:53:10.040
hard to clean up the place get the

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:11.679
horses ready and then we had all these

01:53:11.679 --> 01:53:15.400
people here and at lunch you know I just

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.560
kind of like spaced out and there was

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:19.440
all these people here and there was all

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:21.920
these conversations happening and it was

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:24.960
fun just to space out and

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.760
just

01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:32.280
experience the life that was there and

01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.239
literally I was so brain de I had

01:53:35.239 --> 01:53:38.320
no ability to enter a convers you know I

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:41.000
could see oh there's Zach and stuff's

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
happening over there and but I didn't

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.159
have

01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:47.960
any impulse to figure out what was

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.760
happening you know um

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.199
plus everybody was a lot younger than me

01:54:07.199 --> 01:54:08.960
and I was

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.740
like I like the

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:13.819
[Music]

01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.760
grandma

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.920
that's why I usually invite Sandra to

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.320
these things and it's

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:31.280
like have to be only

01:54:34.719 --> 01:54:37.719
Elder me and David will hold down the

01:54:37.719 --> 01:54:42.560
Elder seat yeah well we're not good at

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.119
it I'll tell okay I'll tell a joke

01:54:45.119 --> 01:54:46.520
you're not old

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.800
enough no but let me tell the story we

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.639
were in this Parallax course right on

01:54:51.639 --> 01:54:53.400
the convivial

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.440
society and in one of the campfires we

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:59.560
had this young guy in his wife who were

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:02.960
very intelligent had a lot of energy had

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.480
a lot of things to

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:08.360
say and they were they

01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:11.960
were talkers like they could talk for 20

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.880
25 minutes on and on and on and not

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.000
realize

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.920
that they they weren't talking to anyone

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.840
like

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:26.280
um and and they were like they were like

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.159
the Smothers Brothers because when he'd

01:55:28.159 --> 01:55:31.000
get tired as soon as he'd get like have

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.199
a little break she'd start you know and

01:55:34.199 --> 01:55:37.719
then he'd get real energize so

01:55:37.719 --> 01:55:41.760
so um so the David and Sandra and I run

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:46.199
that call and after that he got finished

01:55:46.199 --> 01:55:50.920
at one point he's he's finished and then

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:53.440
David and Sandra I think it was first

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:56.199
David maybe or first Sandra they both

01:55:56.199 --> 01:55:58.239
did their thing you know when David does

01:55:58.239 --> 01:56:00.440
something and he like really touches Bas

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:01.840
with someone and the tone of the

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.840
conversation changes the way Phoebe did

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.400
it last

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:08.480
time and then Sandra said one of the

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:12.840
things like one of her things that like

01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:14.840
really

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.639
lands and the energy came up in this

01:56:17.639 --> 01:56:19.000
young guy and he's like blah blah blah

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.320
blah blah blah you know we don't have

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.119
any Elders we don't have any

01:56:22.119 --> 01:56:25.360
Elders it just went on and on and on

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:28.840
it's like like they did this this this

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.679
huge like love

01:56:30.679 --> 01:56:33.719
bomb insightful Elder thing and then

01:56:33.719 --> 01:56:36.000
then as soon as they started going on he

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.840
just complained that there was no Elders

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:40.760
in society anymore so the next time he

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:42.920
wasn't there and we we were all trying

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:43.840
to

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.040
deconstruct uh why we were such

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:50.880
failures at show showing off as showing

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.760
up as Elders it was extremely uh obvious

01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.920
that we had

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.920
failed

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.040
yeah yeah I really wanted to know what

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:18.440
like what's an elder for him you know

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.639
it's like it's very curious I don't know

01:57:22.639 --> 01:57:25.000
I it's it's I know that most people

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.639
don't think they they eliminate from

01:57:27.639 --> 01:57:30.760
that category white

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:34.840
people um so they often think Elders are

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:37.040
like dressed in indigenous clothes and

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.239
have lots of like dark skin and Crags on

01:57:41.239 --> 01:57:42.280
their

01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.800
faces

01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:49.239
um uh because one time I went on Twitter

01:57:49.239 --> 01:57:51.400
and people were like we don't have any

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.400
elders and I named a bunch of women that

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.960
I thought were elders and they're like

01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.920
they're all white you know like all

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:59.159
right whatever it I guess white

01:57:59.159 --> 01:58:01.320
people can't be

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:05.119
Elders I get it so that could have been

01:58:05.119 --> 01:58:07.560
you know and I mean white people were

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.400
saying that white people can't be Elders

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:11.400
so I think that might have been part of

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.520
the

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:21.320
reason I'll for Success next time

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.239
time I mean Elder means you're going to

01:58:26.239 --> 01:58:28.800
die and you know

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:33.400
it what's to argue about that I mean

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:36.040
like eldership you know Elders eldership

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.400
the role of the Elder in

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:40.560
society you you don't even have to be

01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.199
old to be I don't know I don't know what

01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:45.199
they were talking about I thought I it

01:58:45.199 --> 01:58:48.599
was just odd that after these two people

01:58:48.599 --> 01:58:51.599
who like know how to I mean they're not

01:58:51.599 --> 01:58:54.760
performing and and and usually people

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.920
get it was followed by a diet trab that

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.280
there was no El Elders in

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.840
society I just thought well I can

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.960
understand that we've become sort of

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.440
death phobic and aging puic and I mean I

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:11.440
sort of shock people by saying you know

01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.960
this is what I'm doing now is

01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:14.920
apprenticing to become an

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:19.079
elder um and and it's not easy in in the

01:59:19.079 --> 01:59:22.440
way because it's like oh okay the 60s

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.599
then new 50 and 7s then you whatever and

01:59:25.599 --> 01:59:31.320
I'm like no I want the age I am okay you

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:35.400
know but I'm not interested in these you

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.040
know

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:40.599
substitutions um but it's it's not easy

01:59:40.599 --> 01:59:42.560
to do it maybe that's what they were

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:43.639
talking

01:59:43.639 --> 01:59:45.960
about that's not the point the point was

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:49.400
that David and Sandra were exemplary

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.920
just moments

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:54.320
before and then then he ends up and we

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:57.440
were just laughing at ourselves because

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:01.239
like okay well we must not be showing up

02:00:01.239 --> 02:00:06.320
and I don't know anyways um so we had

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:09.159
like another rambling conversation today

02:00:09.159 --> 02:00:13.679
um but hopefully it was useful um and uh

02:00:13.679 --> 02:00:15.960
we'll be back on

02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:20.400
Saturday and um maybe I'll try

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:23.320
to I'll be back in my other office and

02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:27.880
I'll share some maybe some more content

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:30.440
um is Saturday the last one no because

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:33.079
then we have another Thursday so we can

02:00:33.079 --> 02:00:35.199
ramble on next

02:00:35.199 --> 02:00:38.079
Thursday um if that's what we need to do

02:00:38.079 --> 02:00:40.440
thank you very much

02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:45.040
all um for helping Phoebe

02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:49.199
finish her knitting it was a good job we

02:00:49.199 --> 02:00:51.920
we held the space for her to cross the

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.280
finish line so I feel like that's

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.560
success



## Cohort 5

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.840
okay we are going to go into a breakout

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.400
group

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.039
shortly um but I wanted to first see if

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.439
there were any questions clarifying

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.960
questions

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.880
confusions uh around what we've been

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.800
kind of talking about has been very

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
loose

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.440
module uh not quite sure I could

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.239
summarize it myself

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.840
um

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.719
yeah

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.239
um is there any any any entry point to

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.840
that to uh today through a question or

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600
something you've been thinking

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.920
about yes

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.920
David welcome Xavier

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.920
I thought that was savior but I didn't

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.400
want to be

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.520
wrong like if it was like some kind of

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.159
cultural FAA you know okay so I I can I

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.780
can share something

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.840
[Music]

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.040
good I was with somebody yesterday last

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.799
night who um someone here

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.079
knows and yeah

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.240
you and his

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.640
daughter so somebody not quite my age

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.000
and his 20 year old daughter who's a

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.600
Performing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
Artist

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.200
and what I want to relate

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.840
is that these 20s something

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.759
beings and the music they generate and

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.239
dive

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.160
into I found myself in the middle

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.239
of and kind

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.200
of available but holding myself

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.720
back and then what happen over a bit of

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.560
time there was a magnetic

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.159
attraction for my

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.599
body to the way they perform this

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.519
electronic rock and roll these days it

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.400
includes what I'm going to name that was

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.319
attractive to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.760
me Frenzy

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.640
ecstasy and just listening to the tune

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.080
you played I was attracted to the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.360
words but in that space and with that

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.040
music the words were

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.760
secondary the way they moved their

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.959
bodies was what drew me in is that

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.239
frenzied ecstasy M and I think that has

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.879
something to do with this novel culture

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.319
that we the popup School are

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.680
investigating

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.919
I'm not good with going on two screens

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.600
when I'm in the popup school so who is

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.600
that

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.240
it's it's a music

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.800
video video I thought it was gonna be a

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.039
video D dancing and frenzy

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.120
ecstasy um you know it reminds me of

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.199
layman's term excess numinous energy

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.360
right

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.560
um excess numinous

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.560
energy

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.720
which he Associates with spiritual

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.360
spirituality and

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.280
Shamano

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.280
cultures

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.600
um I think you know I wrote this down

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.479
something that is doing nature is also

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.479
doing culture

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.880
um not quite sure what I mean by

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.919
it yeah I mean I think it's like it's

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.120
like we have this mental

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.280
model we have this mental model and then

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.479
we enact it or vice versa or it's all

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.319
all one movement where at one point you

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.120
know at some point people had a story of

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.720
themselves I've said this I think four

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.599
times

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:16.759
already um and the story of themselves

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.360
was like a cosmological story like the

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.520
cosmos is creating the animals and

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.479
create and and creating people and it's

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.599
creating the mountains and is moving the

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.400
oceans it's like one

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.280
orchestrated chorus right and then we at

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.039
some point have this story

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.960
where nature gets created in the

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.880
past and then we have a new story of

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.759
people and their

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.280
culture and Nature's kind of just like

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.160
yes it's climate changes and there's

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.720
volcanoes and stuff

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.800
but it it it's no longer seen as having

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.280
a story right so we talk about Genesis

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.080
you you got six days or five days and

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.800
everything in the cosmos is made and

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800
there's

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.360
no

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.440
um nothing said about it even though

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.240
there was millions and millions of

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.160
cosmological myths prior to you know

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.680
writing Genesis there's just no

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.039
there's no exploration around it it's

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.000
just okay then and

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.199
then Adam and Eve and then now we have a

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.360
story right Adam and Eve and the garden

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.840
of Ed and the snake and can't now we

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.440
have a story and it's like like this

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.560
this this this signature the singularity

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.919
in time

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.159
when the stories the origin stories

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.919
people told of themselves V was separate

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.599
from the origins of of the

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:06.960
universe

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.960
and

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.680
um as if the fact that we're moving

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.400
around the sun which is moving through

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.039
the Galaxy which is moving around one of

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.240
these streams in

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.400
l

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.880
doesn't isn't part of our story you know

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.599
that that's just over there and culture

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.640
is over

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.800
here and

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.519
um when you think of frenzy would you

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:46.800
say frenzy ecstasy this is something

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.200
more like you would see in a nuclear

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.480
fusion reaction or something you know

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.800
something that's that's

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.480
not and then the other thing that I

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.279
think is interesting is that each

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.760
generation music is often and

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.320
performance and

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.279
art is often

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.880
this this stream in culture that they

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.519
call

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.959
counterculture right why is that Counter

00:09:16.959 --> 00:09:18.480
Culture it means like you have like

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.320
these all these counter cultures and

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.959
then you have this thing that's

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.440
continuous called culture or whatever

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.120
what does that what does that

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.120
mean

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.240
Bonnie I'm always amazed by um sort of

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.760
the threads of things that come together

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.959
that relate to the popup school and

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.640
first I want to know I I don't know

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.920
whether you're Whitehead's daughter or

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.120
his

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.399
grandmother not B old I watched that I I

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:06.640
finished watching with Alexander Bard oh

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.560
my God that was that was quite a thing

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.640
um but this morning I get stuff from my

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.640
public library and what came up was a

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.360
book called the land's wild

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.839
music and it's all about

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:31.040
lyrical relationships with the land

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.519
it's a sort of a collection of um essays

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:40.360
by Mark Tre

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.240
trenck who's seems to live in Australia

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.079
I I just very briefly got a quick look

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.880
online at it and he visits with Barry

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.240
Lopez Terry Tempest

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.040
Williams um Mark

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.920
the or uh what's his name

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.880
the Tibetan Guy and um someone else and

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.440
just quickly scrolling through the

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.240
online version the word lyric is

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.320
everywhere really so it just you know is

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.480
such an affirmation for me that what

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.360
we're doing here

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.320
is pulling things together that belong

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.440
together oh yeah because of Alexander

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.519
Bard because he had he kept saying

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.959
Mythos but then did you see what he was

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:35.440
doing yes and I'm like then then I said

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.680
no well I have a new word and I was a

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.800
little worried that

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.880
that I was I was a little worried that

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.680
he was gonna get stuck in the sand

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.279
around it being a Mythos because you

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.120
know he's written like five books and

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.560
stuff like that but but what he was

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.079
doing with his body wasn't like what is

00:11:57.079 --> 00:11:59.360
usually under know the archetype and all

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.279
the symbology and stuff in the

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:06.360
Mythos he was doing you know anyways he

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.399
loved the word which I thought was very

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:15.040
very useful you know um useful um for

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.720
for that word to spread you know

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.680
um something happened in the Mythic I

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.720
mean I wrote this down and I I actually

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.720
have extremely ACC ademic citation that

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.399
I won't bore you with but it'll come out

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:36.760
in the series on lyric culture next year

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.160
um but something happened in the Mythic

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.079
the Mythic is uh you know so we have the

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:44.680
somatic culture has something to do with

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.680
how we

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.800
share we keep our shared identity going

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.519
and

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:54.440
um and

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.120
um and we reduce the I I would say we do

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.320
two things we keep our shared identity

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.360
going and that's from like a top- down

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.040
perspective and the other

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.480
um

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.279
uh oh that's cute danan wild

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.480
music you gotta keep

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.880
that um how so from a topown perspective

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.920
how we keep the shared identity going

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.600
and from the and but also from the

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.639
individual perspective um humans um like

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:37.079
many other social pro-social animals

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:40.120
this is not true for all animals um like

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.760
large cats there's are very there's

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.399
quite a few large cats that are isolates

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:50.079
um but um we have like an existential

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.680
precarity like we need to belong um

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.519
there's this there's this Heart

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:58.000
heart-wrenching video on the web

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.160
somewhere where they show this tribe and

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.320
they um only have

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.440
Spears and they they hunt and eat

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.920
giraffes and of course they can't run as

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.519
fast as giraffes right but what they do

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.199
is they just keep walking after them

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:20.759
until um until something happens like

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:23.720
the the the this the social identity of

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.240
the giraffe starts to erode because they

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.839
get very nervous and then what happens

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.440
is

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.800
somehow one of the

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.320
giraffes is isolated from the others

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.000
then they the way they move one of them

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.120
starts to get like uh what is what is

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.120
Gerard's you know like it's the

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.199
scapegoat like they they start to move

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.959
in a way where they're not where where

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:54.120
that giraffe's movements and no longer

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.639
being M mimicked and it starts to uh

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:59.440
feel isolated and that stands there

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.199
behind a tree while the other drafts

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:03.240
leave and and they kill it it's like a

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.399
interesting psycho technology but so

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:08.720
there's something about pro-social

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.759
animals where we you know the shared

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:15.600
identity has to be pushed out and and

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.959
and maintained of course these things

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.279
you know change and then the belonging

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.279
the precariousness of your belonging

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:27.120
needs has to be um has to be

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.880
solved um so from the top down if if if

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.680
the shared identity breaks down from the

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.759
top down then the culture dissolves and

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:38.800
if the belonging needs don't get uh

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.480
taken care of then the individuals die

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.440
you know die and the culture dissolv so

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.759
there's to put it in a kind of a

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:48.519
psychological so there's there's

00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:51.160
something like that happening and so at

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.639
first you know um as early primates um

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:58.600
those two things were satisfied you know

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.440
arousal and satisfaction by somatic um

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.920
you know mutual grooming sex B pair

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.480
bonding stuff like that but also and you

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.160
know when we think of sematic we also um

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.600
think um also competitive sematics like

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.959
uh when when animals in in a herd you

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:21.759
know go for their pecking order or

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:24.519
chickens a pecking order it's not

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:27.279
bonding activities activities are aren't

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:30.199
always just nice you know they they're

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:35.360
also um you know can can look uh

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.399
competitive um but that makes you feel

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:41.480
you you know like if you lose over and

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.440
over and this one's dominant then you

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.199
still have a social belonging

00:16:45.199 --> 00:16:46.600
relationship with them now it's

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.160
established so we shouldn't just think

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.399
of like the nice things um so then

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:53.720
they're sematic and then they're

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.000
gestural so that I don't no longer have

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.279
to punch you I can just yeah show my big

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:02.000
lobster claws uh and then they become

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.959
mimetic so they become children just ape

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:08.039
them the whole you know sometimes we

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:10.160
don't even remember what they're for and

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.079
then they become ritualized and at this

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.640
point the Mythic culture comes in with

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.520
oral and narrative and this is where you

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.290
start to

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.439
[Music]

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:22.439
have the split this is where the

00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:26.480
narratives become homeric epics or

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.880
giggly mesh um um it's probably earlier

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.000
I think than Homer um um where the whole

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.880
stories about people and territory and

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.160
they tell origin stories um from you

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.799
know um individuals who have establish

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.760
the people so like Adam and Eve and

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.480
Abraham was gifted with a 100,000

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.799
children who were became become the

00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:55.400
Jewish children so that's when you start

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.000
to have this split because in the iic

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.440
you always had gods in the heavens that

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.559
created the cosmologies that were still

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:05.760
active within the human realm but then

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.120
you get this historical event this is

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.960
sounds very bar Alexander bardian but

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.000
you get this historic event with those

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.559
two

00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:19.919
domains or Dimensions get separated and

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:22.520
this is way before the Scientific

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.799
Revolution um where the church allows

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.600
Galileo to do science and Galileo the

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.840
scientists say okay we're not going to

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.200
do metaphysics anymore that split

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.360
happens very early but in this um book

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.840
the series uh Lo logical investigations

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.039
by Barry sandywell which I've never met

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:48.520
anyone who's read it um he shows that in

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.440
the ionians just before the socratic

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.360
right around Homer there was this whole

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.240
other he calls it lyric culture um that

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.400
was established for a short time and

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.559
then didn't didn't make the biggest uh

00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.480
didn't make the biggest influence on the

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.520
European world it's basically A

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.799
four-page Treatise on

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:15.159
European Consciousness

00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:18.400
but um what's nice is to is to be able

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.440
to trace it not only to Jan zwiki and um

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.679
you know that that we find this this in

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:30.679
our m now but it's nice to be able to

00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:36.280
trace it to deeper into to uh a

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:41.000
historical historical point when that

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.400
happened I never really thought of it

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.559
that way until this

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.240
course

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.840
when you did that first um

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.600
diagram in our in the first class

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.840
Bonnie um of the individual the mind the

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.960
body the collective and coming

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.919
together if I

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:21.480
remember you had Society but then you

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.840
had

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.520
culture can you tell me the distinction

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.919
you're making between those two things

00:20:29.919 --> 00:20:33.320
yeah so I would say we had I would say

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.720
you could have a convivial Society

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.200
inside of a different kind of culture

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.960
you could have a convivial Society

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.159
inside of a theoretic culture I've since

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:47.679
changed that and I I'm calling our

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:50.159
conviviality our Tech uh a certain kind

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.280
of

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.280
Techni you know a certain kind of

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.520
Technology convivial technology Maps

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.840
right onto ilage is is you know

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:05.360
convivial tools right so um um and just

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.919
trying to figure out all the you know

00:21:06.919 --> 00:21:08.760
what we've been doing the Mind back into

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.960
the body and then what I was trying to

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.840
distinguish what is lyric culture just

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.600
another name for the convivial life and

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.159
I would say no convi the convivial life

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:24.200
or convivial is is the technology or the

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.679
technique that that we've been looking

00:21:26.679 --> 00:21:29.000
at I mean we didn't have that wasn't in

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.720
this module that was in The Parallax

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.159
course I was just trying to for people

00:21:33.159 --> 00:21:35.080
took both trying to make a distinction

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.039
or trying to make it distinction in my

00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.000
own mind because they're not really they

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.720
have a I mean I brought in janza Wiki in

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.480
The Parallax course because I was saying

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.120
that these

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.559
are you know ilich had a lot of critique

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.480
but not a lot of Hope other than his

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.520
religious impulse and so we brought

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.080
these other voices in like saying that

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.480
you know that this this is the cultural

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.840
Renaissance around uh the convivial the

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.840
convivial life

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:11.799
um

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.559
yeah I know there's not really an answer

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:17.039
but I was just trying to figure out what

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:19.159
were the two different frames that we

00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:26.840
were were they the same thing and um

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.960
yeah

00:22:39.679 --> 00:22:42.159
any other questions and then got two

00:22:42.159 --> 00:22:44.799
more minutes and it'll be exactly at the

00:22:44.799 --> 00:22:48.000
half hour we break up

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.120
grp like it TI in

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.120
today I got a

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.960
quick um ask of what

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.960
emergence you know that came up a lot

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.400
with the Bard thing is it kind of my

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.320
intake is that it's like you have

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.799
Evolution and

00:23:05.799 --> 00:23:09.480
then you know uh for

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.200
example

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.600
 we we're made of matter and then

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.919
the matter kind of evolved and

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:16.520
eventually Consciousness emerged out of

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.159
it is that a brief kind of summary of

00:23:18.159 --> 00:23:20.919
what emergence means he has this thing

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:23.840
called transcendental Vector emergence

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.880
right

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.880
TBE

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.600
vector

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.799
is it

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:34.279
TV um oh I don't remember what it was

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.360
yeah it was transal Vector something but

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.159
he kept saying it's not Emergen Ser it's

00:23:38.159 --> 00:23:40.520
not emergence it's opposite it's it's

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.679
not

00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:46.720
emergentism emergentism so he would uh

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.000
um he would critique emergentism the way

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.960
I did in my before Socrates series

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.960
because

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.080
emergentism is just uh um you know if I

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.400
say you have matter and then uh life

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.640
emerges from it it's kind of just saying

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.400
oh a miracle happens in here we we

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.880
people don't really know uh even the ter

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.720
scientific Community argues about uh the

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.400
theoretical foundations of the word

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.080
emergence okay so um and the whole

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.640
science is called myology if you want to

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.880
read a book on myology

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.159
um and um so emergence I would say is a

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:37.320
science of change or a theory of change

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.520
but most people use it because we don't

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.600
have much

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.279
information we don't really know how

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:50.039
matter slips into becoming life but we

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:52.360
know that there's we have a strong

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.000
intuition that they're of different

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.120
sorts okay um and so

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.520
um he like like me I would say well

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.039
that's just emergentism you just say oh

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:09.720
then life emerges it's just a taxonomy

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.440
it's like you might as well say miracle

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.559
happened or God put his hand you know um

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:19.480
so um and then you can you can I mean

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.480
this is very interesting uh part of the

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.880
weeds that I'm sure we'll get to talking

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.360
about I'm not sure that we agree

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.760
Alexander and I agree so much but um so

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.320
one of the metaphors for emergence is

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.799
that something happens that at one state

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:44.760
that changes the properties okay so when

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.480
water boils it has properties that

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.399
didn't it didn't have uh when it when it

00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:53.880
was Liquid right so when it's liquid

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.279
it's got osmotic pressure and blah blah

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:57.960
blah blah and when it boils it has

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.399
different properties um when water um if

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:04.880
you think of water inside

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.960
water

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.159
um the interesting thing about water in

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:12.440
the liquid form is that its density is

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.240
the same as the density of

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.159
water but the density of ice water is

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:23.679
lower than the density of water it

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:27.120
floats so water when water is in water

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.480
it doesn't

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.120
float when water is ice it actually

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.480
floats in its own self okay so that's a

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.399
property there's many other properties

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:38.760
but so it was first used to because they

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.080
couldn't understand what was happening

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.840
between phase

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.919
transitions because it's

00:26:44.919 --> 00:26:47.240
stochastic like you don't know exactly

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.120
when it's going to happen but you can

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.360
observe when it happens and the

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.880
mechanisms are nonlinear it's truly

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.760
complex so you can't say this did this

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.760
did this did this this so they use the

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.720
word emergence now this what's

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.240
interesting about this this is the true

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.120
use of the word emergence

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.960
because if you have you because the same

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.600
thing is going through the phase

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.000
transitions water is not all of a sudden

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.120
different when it's gas you know what

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.559
I'm saying is it was saying it's the

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:23.120
same thing whereas emergentism says oh

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.360
now we have something completely

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.880
different and it can't go back or

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.720
forward right so this is what

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.559
emergentism is it's got a much more uh

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:37.919
strong gap between the levels and we

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:41.000
don't think of the phase transitions of

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.159
waters as somehow stacked higher to

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:45.720
lower right we we just we just see that

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.000
that that there's there's there's change

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.799
in properties so I would say that um the

00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:59.399
levels are are changes in potential

00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:00.640
states of

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.960
nature so

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.640
so I have nature all the way up and down

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.120
and I have phase transitions from

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.320
complex potential States thinking so

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.919
this is a way to to not reduce the

00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:19.159
Miracles I mean I think it's a miracle

00:28:19.159 --> 00:28:20.519
that water you know everybody it's a

00:28:20.519 --> 00:28:22.240
miracle that water has you know water is

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.919
one of the few elements that is light

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:27.640
less dense when it freezes and if that

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.559
was not true I think it's the only it

00:28:29.559 --> 00:28:31.480
might be the only liquid that does that

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.080
if that were not true life would not be

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.840
possible I mean there's there's like a

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.760
lot of miracles in science um but we

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.480
don't have to have this word you know

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.240
this other meaning of

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.519
emergentism um because water doesn't not

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:51.640
become H2O the elements now if the when

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.279
the gas when water became a gas if the

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:57.440
elements actually changed by some Al

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.799
chemical like weirdness that would be

00:28:59.799 --> 00:29:01.240
more like

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.240
emergentism um but the fact that the

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:09.159
properties change so um so

00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:12.960
uh did that answer your question and and

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.200
um yeah that clicked yeah Bard would

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.080
agree with that but then he didn't like

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.440
my vectors the way I drew the vectors

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.559
out so um that needs we'll we'll talk I

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:27.080
know aong I think uh the other guy

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.799
that's going to come in actually created

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:30.960
the vector Theory so we'll

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.960
see

00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:40.399
um um and they'll said culture emerged

00:29:40.399 --> 00:29:44.399
go ahead um Xavier X yeah the man

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.120
formerly known as

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.799
Xavier

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:52.559
exitus much cooler um yeah no the the

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.279
you just got me thinking when you were

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:56.720
with your definition of Emer and I

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.480
thought you know this interesting

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.440
property of water that you were

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.919
describing where you're like okay well

00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:03.320
on some level when water is gas versus

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.960
Ice versus water and then you like in

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.360
the reductionist mode you go down and

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.799
you're like oh it's just a bunch of H2O

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:09.840
and it's kind of H2O in both scenarios

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.919
and nothing's changed and so there's

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:13.480
this sense then in which emergence in

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.519
that sense is like the macro thing

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:17.880
changing while the micro thing is in

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.600
some sense fixed or it's like only

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.919
changed in its in how it's Rel relating

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:24.919
with other members of itself and I was

00:30:24.919 --> 00:30:26.840
just trying to think if that ever

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.519
happens other way and I was thinking

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:30.360
about we're

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.679
quite when we encode information in

00:30:32.679 --> 00:30:33.720
different ways we're almost doing the

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.880
opposite of that so there's this

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.720
interesting mode in which like if I send

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.399
you like a an image file you know maybe

00:30:39.399 --> 00:30:40.799
on my computer it was stored on like a

00:30:40.799 --> 00:30:43.200
magnetic hard drive so like that image

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.159
like the macro phenomenon of the image

00:30:45.159 --> 00:30:47.279
was in the micro represented by like a

00:30:47.279 --> 00:30:48.960
bunch of magnetic States and then it

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.240
gets suddenly turned into a bunch of

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.559
like electrical impulses and then it

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:53.039
gets turned into a bunch of photons and

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:55.000
then maybe on your computer it's like a

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.639
in the flash memory and it's a bunch of

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:58.080
like the states of electrons tunneled

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.440
across insulators or something so the M

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.840
here it's like the flip of the water

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.399
thing where the macro thing has stayed

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:04.760
the same it's the same picture the same

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.600
picture the same picture but it's the

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.279
micro that's completely like changed in

00:31:09.279 --> 00:31:11.240
its Essence so it's like the inverse of

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.799
emergence in some

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:15.399
sense yeah and that reminds me of this

00:31:15.399 --> 00:31:18.039
word transduction right so the

00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:22.880
information comes in to a node or you

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.639
know a magnetic drive or something and

00:31:25.639 --> 00:31:28.000
it it's and then and then

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.399
it gets

00:31:29.399 --> 00:31:31.880
transduced uh you know this this what

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.639
this is the definition of a modem right

00:31:34.639 --> 00:31:37.360
so it goes from you know we used to have

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.279
to have the dial up and you'd get radio

00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:41.960
waves and then you needed a modem so

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.159
that it could talk to your

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:50.399
computer um and uh

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.679
yeah but without I mean that a lot of

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:56.639
times the problem with us you see the

00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:58.880
problem with our mental models and this

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.880
is I I wrote a a a quote from har he's

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.440
like we should we we need to do

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.200
philosophy around we need to

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.200
philosophize around what is possible not

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.799
just what is most

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:12.519
influential and so one of the problems

00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:15.440
with our mental models is we can hardly

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.159
think of emergence without thinking of

00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:21.399
things getting more complex or thinking

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:23.519
of it going in the opposite direction

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.799
and thinking of it as being reductive

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:28.159
like the signal gets reduced this is not

00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:29.679
necessarily the

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:32.039
case you know so there's many more

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:34.039
possibilities about these different

00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:36.480
correlations these different movements

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.799
that we think of and I think that's

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:39.840
something you're touching on like like

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.679
if something emerges and gets more

00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:44.440
complex in that mental model uh when it

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.039
goes in the opposite models is there a

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:50.240
reduction and this is the Assumption in

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.960
Greg Enrique's uh transcendental

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.519
naturalism that that it gets reduced to

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:58.399
Newtonian uh cos Al ity in in the new

00:32:58.399 --> 00:33:01.559
science says no nothing gets

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:04.559
reduced uh in that it doesn't get

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:06.559
reduced in that direction and then I

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.080
argue you can

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.279
reduce in the other direction because

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:12.399
it's getting so complex it's it's just

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:14.639
not real

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:17.480
anymore yeah Cher's just calling back to

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.840
the Michael 11 video and that's

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.760
interesting because on the one hand it

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.120
feels like he's capturing on the other

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.919
hand he he has this very top down notion

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:24.760
still where he's like the top levels

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.720
warp the like spaces in which the lower

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.240
level are navigating and then those warp

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.080
the spaces in which they're not so so he

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.720
has this like on the one hand this very

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.880
top down sense but yeah on the other

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.679
hand like like you're just describing

00:33:36.679 --> 00:33:38.480
when he describes that like on our

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.240
cellular level we're navigating

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.120
morphological space morphological space

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.840
is this very high dimensional space you

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.559
can add a lump here or move that way or

00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:48.120
warp this way and then but then we as

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.279
these high Lev enties are just

00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:51.000
navigating three-dimensional space so we

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.840
become larger and more complex but the

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.919
like space that we navigate has reduced

00:33:54.919 --> 00:33:57.679
to just three spatial Dimensions so like

00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:01.320
he's there is this like simplification

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.360
as As you move up so this is exactly

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.839
what Evo and I are going to spend the

00:34:08.839 --> 00:34:11.280
first three weeks in November working on

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.560
this notion we have this we call Action

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.720
potentials but it works with internal

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.919
and and external relations and it's

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:21.839
supposed to fix this that that when you

00:34:21.839 --> 00:34:24.480
get more

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:29.159
complex you you know do so you

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:32.119
know when I get up and walk across the

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:35.200
room do I Su supervene on my cells they

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.760
have they have no they have no

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.800
choice right so that's that's the top

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.440
down thing but if I'm a good Buddhist I

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.200
wonder what makes me want to get up and

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.200
walk across the room in the first place

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.040
I have no choice so we're trying to fix

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.599
that and this is this is exactly where

00:34:55.599 --> 00:35:00.560
the two those two inquiries overlap um

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.640
and um

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.960
um so that's that's what Evo and are

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.680
trying to we're trying to fix that like

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.640
we have an intuition for it but language

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.880
is so damn hard and it's and it's

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.960
impossible to draw it because as soon as

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.240
you draw it then this thing is also a

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.040
fractal of what you've just drawn and it

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.079
goes all over the place but this is the

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:27.040
yeah and that's what we were talking

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:29.680
about just before the origins of culture

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.599
which is a collective individual we're

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.599
talking about the origins of the comp

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:36.160
you know we are compound individuals is

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.119
culture a compound individual or is it a

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:40.839
collective individual well we have

00:35:40.839 --> 00:35:43.000
intuitions but what's the difference

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.160
when I refuse to call something a

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.880
collective individual compound

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.040
individual because I think it's a

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.200
collective

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.440
individual um White had talked about

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.480
this but he just used the word

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.119
Society society's in this direction and

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:58.680
society's in that that directions and

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.560
unless it's buried somewhere and his

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.319
impossible to read rhetoric uh it's not

00:36:04.319 --> 00:36:06.839
really clear um but we're trying to

00:36:06.839 --> 00:36:10.960
solve that um because just by the way

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.200
you've presented it you know it's not

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.119
consistent there's an inconsistency in

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:21.000
our view that's that that is constrained

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.119
by these inside it's constrained because

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:25.440
we we always talk in terms of what's

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.599
inside and outside things yeah

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.920
baby so I was about to text David what

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.680
the does any of this have to do

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.960
with me because I can't follow

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.760
it that having putting that aside when

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.280
you just

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.800
said about uh

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.200
God you know

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.520
that

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.160
your intention to walk AC across the

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.599
room is superseding your body and your

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:04.720
body is is has no choice but to do that

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.760
the cells cells the cells the other hand

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.200
from a Buddhist P

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.240
perspective you

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.119
know

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:17.480
who where am I getting the information

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.319
or the desire to go across the room

00:37:21.319 --> 00:37:24.319
and you said something about not having

00:37:24.319 --> 00:37:25.599
Choice

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:29.359
there but all what I wanted to say was

00:37:29.359 --> 00:37:32.920
that when you said

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.240
that for the first time I think in this

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.200
conversation I had movement inside of

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.359
me that uh that I wanted to just say

00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:48.960
Okay stop right there what you just

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.960
said

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.640
uh is moving something in me I don't

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.920
know what it is I don't know what it

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.800
means

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.960
um and I don't want to keep rattling on

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.240
and going to the next point the next

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.400
point the next point because something

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.240
real just happened when you said that so

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.800
that's all I have to say and I I don't

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.880
know if anybody has any way to um join

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.200
me there or

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.359
whatever everything Xavier said is in

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:25.520
that example if you contemplate that

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.599
example everything he said which was

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:31.319
quite you

00:38:31.319 --> 00:38:36.839
know uh conceptually thick um is in that

00:38:36.839 --> 00:38:39.359
question when I because for a long time

00:38:39.359 --> 00:38:42.280
people would say you know Bonnie yeah

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.480
but Bonnie you're talking about right

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.440
now okay and what I just requested and

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.880
maybe it wasn't very clear was something

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.880
just moved in me like I had an inner

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.000
response like an inner call and response

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.250
to what you said and I wna I want to

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.839
[Music]

00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:12.680
um make space for that to show itself

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.880
more because because I can't because all

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.599
the ideas about it and the talk about it

00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:19.560
seems like it swirls around but when

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.560
something actually

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.880
happens in my

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.920
being then I think okay there's

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.640
something real going on so am I making

00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:33.440
sense I don't know what to say because

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.640
what I was going to say is that's

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.599
because this question that you can

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:41.280
contemplate of what gets up and walks

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:45.119
across the room is a very significant

00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:47.480
question all the other stuff that we

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.520
said it was interesting but it didn't

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.280
matter that you you don't have to

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.119
understand what else went on because

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:57.319
this is the Crux of the matter what gets

00:39:57.319 --> 00:39:59.839
up and goes across the

00:39:59.839 --> 00:40:02.680
room yeah and I would say that I would

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.680
that that I agree with you and that and

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.319
that attending on a personal level to

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.200
that

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.560
question what moves and what's chatter

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.079
and what's habit and what's wound and

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:23.880
whatever else that that is um motion

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.280
that's already put in place as opposed

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.640
to what's

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.760
actually

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.760
um

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.760
original is there such a thing as

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.040
original

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.079
all right let's go into a breakout group

00:41:00.079 --> 00:41:03.839
and the question is going to be um do

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:06.560
when I get up and walk across the room

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.599
do does the ey that Bonnie is the ey in

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:13.720
control of all my is that what's

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:17.440
happening am I the controller that moves

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.960
all the other organisms in me

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.160
or from the Buddhist perspective the

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.960
fact that I had an arousal state got up

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.359
and walk across the room came from my

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:33.119
pancreas and it's working with its

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:35.520
insulin and my bacteria and so in

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.960
reality I have no control at

00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:42.720
all but then you have to ask the

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.480
question the cells themselves are

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:54.079
collectives so let's just sit with this

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:56.319
is everything we've been talking about

00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:58.160
the last two months so we'll go into a

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.200
breakout room uh for 30

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.960
minutes and talk about this

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.920
conundrum

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.880
um that uh why don't I don't see the

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.680
breakout room things it's over there now

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.839
all

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:25.160
right three to four participants 30

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.160
minutes

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.200
um okay enjoy your

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.920
conundrum and enjoy your

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.160
company

00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:39.559
I'll just share that I feel mildly

00:43:39.559 --> 00:43:44.040
bullied for being put into

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.040
that and in like uh I think I feel

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.960
bullied by reality actually in a good

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.000
way there's there's maybe what I'm

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.640
trying to say is um it was really

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.200
interesting being in a breakout room I

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.440
was I was in it with John and

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.040
Phoebe

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.440
and Katie and

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.640
Xavier

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:11.040
and I found

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.640
it I was saying this at the very end of

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.400
the group but almost like for the entire

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.599
duration of that breakout group I felt

00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:24.200
like I was physically like my body was

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.480
physically being stretched and pulled

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.079
and almost like like like an entity was

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:34.720
pulling me and almost like wrapping me

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.319
up and then

00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:39.880
like honestly it felt it felt like

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.480
somehow my body

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:47.319
was doing something in order to hold the

00:44:47.319 --> 00:44:49.400
amount of polarity that was in that

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:54.640
breakout room and the the way in which I

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.520
felt Phoebe

00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.520
really ground like I felt you you tunnel

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.280
that's this is how I physically felt it

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.079
like I felt you tunnel down into what

00:45:05.079 --> 00:45:07.079
you were describing as origin this kind

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:10.559
of like kiss on the mouth from God like

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:14.760
and I was feeling my body almost pulled

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.480
in but then I was also physically next

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.720
to Xavier in bodies of space and he was

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.960
just like over here and almost like

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.880
creating this whole

00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:30.559
I don't know how to describe it like

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:32.599
yeah just like these these like frame

00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:34.440
after frame after frame after frame of

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.520
trying to make sense of what Phoebe was

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.559
describing and being

00:45:41.559 --> 00:45:45.000
caught somehow in the middle like

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.640
somehow in that field

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.440
was yeah I felt like a kind of energetic

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.559
gymnastics that I'm still physically

00:45:53.559 --> 00:45:55.880
actually trying to process right now uh

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.079
so I don't really know what happened but

00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:02.040
I feel moved to share that

00:46:20.599 --> 00:46:24.480
experience I uh the question was seemed

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.800
like it was something like

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:32.079
um am I the controller of my action on

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:34.240
some level or is my is there

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.800
rousel you know making me move on you

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.240
know something that's that's not uh

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.839
coming from what I think I'm in charge

00:46:44.839 --> 00:46:46.760
of is that making move so there's an

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.240
either or and we talked about the

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.280
particular

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.440
and whatever the other side of the

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.800
particular is the all

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.440
um you know the polarity of that

00:47:05.839 --> 00:47:08.599
and I just want to say that the image

00:47:08.599 --> 00:47:11.240
came to me from it's St Bernard of

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.960
clairo was one of the last of the he was

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.240
the last of the desert fathers or the

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:18.240
fathers of the church and I think he

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.839
wrote like in the I don't know what 1200

00:47:20.839 --> 00:47:23.920
1200s or something like that I can't

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.079
remember and it was collection of his

00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:30.040
sermons and and he said when we go from

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:34.160
the kiss of the feet of God to the kiss

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.970
on the lips of God that there's a

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:39.160
[Music]

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.240
um there's a both end

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.240
there of being

00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:49.680
exquisitely and

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.000
vulnerably

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.240
oneself and yet that self is being

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.240
utterly

00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:06.480
um move beyond anything that I know by

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.880
what it is that I'm touching kissing in

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.720
an

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.599
Embrace so I'm not

00:48:14.599 --> 00:48:17.920
sure how this answers the question but

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.800
it feels like there's a both end and

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.119
then there's there's a there's something

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:24.119
beyond that that

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:27.640
is um

00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:30.319
yeah that's as much as I can say but I

00:48:30.319 --> 00:48:32.119
wanted

00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:34.960
to talk further about the kiss of God

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.119
because that that was an interesting

00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:42.160
powerful image that came to

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:57.599
me

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.599
in that same group I felt we were caught

00:49:03.599 --> 00:49:06.599
between Bon's two questions whether I

00:49:06.599 --> 00:49:09.040
was in control of the cells or the

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.640
arousal state was in

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.559
control and the kiss of God is really

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.440
interesting in

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:21.480
relationship who is in

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.520
control

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.559
yeah I was in a group with matalina and

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:40.760
um Sandra I mean Susan excuse me I'm

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:41.880
sorry

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.839
Susan and the question like evoked a

00:49:44.839 --> 00:49:48.920
really strong memory for me um I walked

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.799
from from Canada to Mexico in

00:49:51.799 --> 00:49:54.000
2019

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.640
and I mentioned you know like almost

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.559
every day I kept having this thought of

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.720
like I don't want to do this I can't do

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.720
this and yet every day I would put my

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.319
pack on and put one fo in front of the

00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:09.119
other and I remember one a couple

00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:13.319
experiences where um I I was walking and

00:50:13.319 --> 00:50:15.280
it was clear like I was on the backbone

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.160
of this

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:21.119
mountain and something like switched and

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:22.720
it was really clear that the mountain

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.200
was actually walking me like and there

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.079
was

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:29.520
just genuine experience of I'd be

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.559
breathing and and breathing heavily but

00:50:32.559 --> 00:50:34.599
it was it felt like the mountain was

00:50:34.599 --> 00:50:38.319
breathing through me um and that yeah

00:50:38.319 --> 00:50:42.000
the mountain was walking on my body and

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.119
moments of of swimming in the

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:48.119
water and this feeling of like this is

00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:49.920
the water experiencing what it's like to

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.880
be water so just sort of this like

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:55.799
feeling of the body being this

00:50:55.799 --> 00:50:58.079
instrument this vessel through which

00:50:58.079 --> 00:50:59.799
nature is experiencing itself which

00:50:59.799 --> 00:51:02.079
water is experiencing itself like

00:51:02.079 --> 00:51:03.760
swimming and just going this is this is

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.480
what the water the water's feeling what

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.079
it it's like to be

00:51:08.079 --> 00:51:12.480
water and um that's kind of when I think

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.880
about that pull like what pulls you

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.799
across the room um I notice when I can

00:51:16.799 --> 00:51:20.240
really relax my body and and it's really

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:24.119
open it it for me what moves it is this

00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:26.200
deep kind of curiosity

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.040
and sort of this sense that life or

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.599
nature whatever word you want to use

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:33.520
wants to know what it is and what it can

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.599
be and it's kind of this Natural

00:51:36.599 --> 00:51:39.799
Curiosity that pulls it to learn and to

00:51:39.799 --> 00:51:42.400
understand what's possible like what can

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.240
what can I be what can I

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.839
become and it's not from the mind but

00:51:46.839 --> 00:51:50.240
it's um I mean the mind's part of it but

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:52.160
in those moments I can just feel my body

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.599
just being this really open vessel

00:51:53.599 --> 00:51:55.319
through which nature is wanting to exper

00:51:55.319 --> 00:51:58.119
experience what it

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.040
is I'm

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.040
um I moved to speak up in part because

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.559
charl just kicked me in the shin and

00:52:23.559 --> 00:52:25.520
said you have to do your work too and go

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.400
down to the body I think I'm doing it

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.480
all on your behalf so I'm like oh

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.440
okay

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.870
um yeah and it's true I don't

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.480
[Music]

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.960
um it's hard to speak from the body I

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.319
think or I I think for some people here

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:44.839
that's like the natural mode and this is

00:52:44.839 --> 00:52:47.040
coming up in our group that um drawing

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.799
this dis delineation almost between like

00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:50.079
sort of the first person and the third

00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:53.480
person and I think in like Mich 11 video

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.480
and a lot of these things where we're

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.880
talking about looking at multicellular

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.119
organisms forming into larger things

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:01.440
we're speaking from that third person

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.680
place where you're just looking at stuff

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.200
happening and like looking at those

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.680
patterns and thinking about causality in

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.839
that

00:53:06.839 --> 00:53:10.400
way um and that's a lot easier for me

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.960
I'm an engineer and I do a lot of

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.000
looking at things from the third

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.240
person um Char's

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.799
now holding my foot

00:53:21.799 --> 00:53:24.440
um so this is hard like I don't actually

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.319
totally know how to how to do this from

00:53:27.319 --> 00:53:28.640
from the interior from the first person

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.280
experience I don't even as much know how

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.200
to answer the

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.000
question from that place I guess one

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.160
thing maybe I would just say is is

00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:46.720
um I think each like is it is it the me

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.240
is it the cells is the

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.000
something I think those the answers to

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.040
those feel almost like from the first-

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.599
person experience they're like it's like

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:56.720
Char saying she's pulled between these

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.200
two different like Mo ways of seeing it

00:53:58.200 --> 00:53:59.799
or something they're almost

00:53:59.799 --> 00:54:03.359
like full full body it's like when the

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.839
necer cube switches from being this way

00:54:04.839 --> 00:54:05.880
and then it's that way and the cube is

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.400
kind of n way there you can ask the

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.680
question all day is the cube popping up

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.119
this way or is the cube popping up that

00:54:10.119 --> 00:54:12.680
way but the body thing the thing you

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.200
actually feel is it right now it feels

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.400
like it's this way right now it feels

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.520
like it's that way and when um prob when

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.520
you were describing that feeling like

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.079
you're being walked I know what it is to

00:54:22.079 --> 00:54:24.160
just tune into that mode and like it's

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.880
actually when it's a activity I love

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.400
when I'm going for a walk is to suddenly

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.559
like feel as though I'm pulled along and

00:54:29.559 --> 00:54:31.240
it's as true in some sense like the

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.520
necer cube but from the posture of

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.720
feeling that way I act in a different

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.720
way

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.799
um

00:54:41.799 --> 00:54:44.280
uh but yeah and like I guess this is all

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.200
in the body in in some sense for me it

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.920
is up here like I'm speaking right now

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.559
from like kind of a nasal place and like

00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:52.520
an upper chest place and like a head and

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:57.079
an eye and like an elevated thing

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.640
um I think that's partly zoomed too I

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.359
think if I was I think I if I was face

00:55:01.359 --> 00:55:02.960
to face with

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.000
you I think the way in which I would go

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.839
into the body would be through your

00:55:06.839 --> 00:55:09.319
body you and you and you and you it

00:55:09.319 --> 00:55:11.280
would be something about it would be it

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.160
would be rather it would be trying to

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.799
draw it would be like searching for

00:55:14.799 --> 00:55:16.280
resonance with another person it would

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.119
be like oh when I see it like where oh I

00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:20.960
can see we're going this way oh I can

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.039
see we're going that and like kind of

00:55:23.039 --> 00:55:25.880
picking a a joint thing to be in and

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.000
then and

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.079
then um and then carefully watching the

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.960
little like the facial expressions and

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.000
the blushes and the quickening of the

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.240
breath and all those little things and

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.920
noticing that little and then like

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.880
choosing which thing to amplify there or

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:43.079
which thing to like tune into or being I

00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:44.359
think

00:55:44.359 --> 00:55:46.480
that's

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.119
often yeah I feel like there's often

00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:50.839
this dietic quality to really getting in

00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:52.240
the body because then you're tuning your

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.000
body with somebody else's body uh

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.359
and I find that much harder to do over

00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:01.760
Zoom okay so now I'm going to say

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.839
something I think it's a tragedy that

00:56:04.839 --> 00:56:07.280
you had to justify the way you were

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.799
excited about the

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:13.079
concepts I don't like the body police

00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:15.359
and I don't like the first person police

00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:19.200
I don't like the third person police

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.920
either

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:31.440
I think it comes from sour personalities

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.880
on both

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.039
ends his body was alive and he was

00:56:39.039 --> 00:56:40.920
making these connections what did it

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.119
matter if you didn't don't understand

00:56:43.119 --> 00:56:45.240
what he read or didn't

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:49.400
read why did the police show

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.880
up

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.640
when people are sharing shared

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.400
simulations through language we just

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.720
talked about this then the part of them

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.319
ingresses into their body and then they

00:57:06.319 --> 00:57:08.720
become

00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:13.760
intimate it's not acceptable at the

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.160
popup school to have a first person or a

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.200
third person

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.280
police like having policemen in school

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:23.680
with their

00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:26.799
guns

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.520
I like what you're saying but say more

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.200
about what was first person and what was

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:45.960
third person well Xavier's like he's in

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.640
the position of trying to apologize for

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:51.000
having a conceptual hit on what we were

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.680
talking about that's and he called it a

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.799
third person perspective

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.720
and all of this is life all of it is

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.680
life now I get it and this is why I get

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.160
it because technological

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.839
speech has abused nature and abused

00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:18.119
people but it's not the speech it's the

00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:20.319
people who use that tool what they're

00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:24.839
about and so sometimes we mistake techn

00:58:24.839 --> 00:58:27.599
logical or conceptual speech for abuse

00:58:27.599 --> 00:58:29.839
because that's the world we live in they

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:32.440
use the abusive people use those words

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:34.520
but just because someone so if you could

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.640
read his body you would see he's not

00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.119
being abusive he was being creative and

00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:44.359
the life was coming

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:54.920
forth and I want more of that in the pop

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.119
of

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.000
school and I just want to end I just

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.920
want to sit with

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.640
this

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:40.480
all

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.839
right no I'm just gonna

00:59:43.839 --> 00:59:48.799
stop okay this is what today was

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.599
about and what is first

00:59:52.599 --> 00:59:58.200
person speaking about your first person

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:02.079
experience they're both

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.359
essential but the police are not

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:14.160
allowed okay thank

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.160
you
