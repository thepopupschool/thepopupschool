# Memory

## What is human memory described as, rather than a standalone system?
A **cognitive package deal** where sensation, perception, imagination, and action are woven together.

## What is the assembling process that constitutes remembering also known as?
**Re-membering**.

## What is involved in "re-membering" memory?
Assembling fragments of **sensations, virtual perceptions, internal representations, and story fragments** into a coherent whole.

## For a memory to be useful in the present, what quality must it possess in relation to the current situation?  
Coherence

## What fundamental cognitive capacity becomes impossible for an organism in the absence of memory?  
Learning

## What is the "delta" in the context of memory and learning?
The **difference or variance** between one moment and the next.

## What is the metaphor used to describe memory as a thread?
A thread that **weaves the past into the present**.

## Name three of the four types of memory pathways identified in the source.  
Any three of the following: episodic, mimetic, theoretic, enacted

## What type of memory is characterized by "experiential knowing" and is exemplified by a horse's knowledge of a particular river crossing?  
Episodic memory

## Describe a specific limitation of episodic memory illustrated by the behavior of horses in unfamiliar environments.
Difficulty generalizing knowledge to new but similar situations, like finding their way through an unfamiliar gate in a paddock or crossing a river at a new location.

## Mimetic memory is described as being rooted in what two fundamental aspects of bodily experience?
Gesture and action. A **Bodily know-how**.

## Provide an example from the source of how mimetic memory might function when one cannot consciously recall specific information.  
Allowing your fingers to "remember" a phone number or piano piece through ingrained action protocols.

## Theoretic memory is described as a form of knowing that is rooted in which other type of memory mentioned in the source?  
Mimetic memory

## What is the evolutionary relationship described between the three types of memory (episodic, mimetic, theoretic)?
Theoretic memory is rooted in **mimetic memory**, which in turn is rooted in **episodic memory**.

## According to Andy Clark's Theory of Ecological Assembly, what is the general tendency of organisms regarding the storage of memories to conserve energy?  
To off-load memories into the external environment.

## What often serves as triggers for retrieving bodily stored memories?
**Arousal states** that flow into "virtual perception" space.

## Action protocols are said to be stored in the body through which specific type of memory, according to the source?  
Episodic memory

## What does collective or social memory primarily relies on?
**Procedural resourcefulness**.

## Instead of a "prediction model" in the brain, what might be a more accurate way to understand the brain's activity related to action and sensation?  
A **retrospective mapping** of where the body is going or has gone.

## In the context of memory, "re-membering" literally implies what kind of process?  
Assembling parts into a whole
