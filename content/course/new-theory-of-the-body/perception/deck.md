# On Perception

## According to the preface of "On Perception," what was the basic conclusion after two years of Consciousness studies regarding human perception?
That (unlike other animals) **human perception was faulty, rarely to be trusted, and that everything we took to be real was likely an illusion**.

## What are two concise cases presented in "On Perception" to counter the argument that human perception is faulty?
The case of **athletes** and the case of **illusions**.

## How does the example of athletes argue for the reliability of perception?
Their **perceptual organs are strongly coupled with the environment in a precise way** to direct behavior, movement, gesture, and action with remarkable accuracy.

## How does the example of illusions argue for the reliability of perception?
That **we know they are illusions is also given to us by our perceptual organs**.

## What does "On Perception" define perception as?
**Participatory Cognition**.

## What does "co-gnize" or "co-gnosis" mean?
To "**together know**".

## According to "On Perception," what are the two senses of "together know" in relation to perception?
1. Perceptual organs **participate together** in complex ways. 2. Perception is deeply reliant on **participation with the world** through movement and manipulation.

## Provide an example of how our perception adjusts for "errors" through feedback with the world, as mentioned in "On Perception."
Amazonian spearfishers "**intuitively**" account for the **refraction of light in water**.

## What research finding supports the idea that "sight" is dependent on hearing?
The possibility of **echolocation with blind people**.

## According to "On Perception," how might the mouth be involved in the perceptual organ we call "sight"?
Often, people guide their hands (e.g., threading a needle) by **moving their mouth**, which is evolutionarily related to touch and sight.

## What research involving kittens suggests that the perceptual organ of "sight" is also dependent on the feet?
Kittens not allowed to **walk around** normally remained functionally blind, unlike those who could use their feet.

## According to Tor Norretranders, approximately how many bits of information does the world send to our sensory mechanisms per second? How many do we consciously perceive?
Over **eleven million bits** per second are sent, while we consciously perceive about **forty bits** a second (possibly exaggerated).

## What does "On Perception" suggest we should remain vigilant about despite the limited portion of conscious experience?
What might be available in **deeper prereflective awareness**.

## According to "On Perception," how does the body cognize itself? What sense is key to this?
Through its own **body-consciousness, namely that of touch**, which is "self-othering".

## Why can't the eye see itself, the ear hear itself, etc., according to "On Perception"?
Because the body **self-others**.

## What constitutes the core perception of self, other, and world in our experience?
That **the body self-others**.

## What is "apperception" as described in "On Perception"?
A **true, direct perception at the level of the background**.

## According to "On Perception," what is the mind's sense of time derived from?
The **background processing of the body**, a virtual simulation of bodily movement.

## What do affect-laden "arousal energies" in the background processes prime in the senses?
The "**appetitive drive**" of the senses, giving them relevance to pursue a goal.

## How does "On Perception" describe the senses in contrast to passive organs?
More like "**cars on open roads**" designed to go somewhere; dynamic and creative "illuminators" and "amplifiers" of experience.

## What does "On Perception" call the zone of participation where the perceptual system is in contact with the world?
The "**hylozoic zone**".

## According to "On Perception," what drives the sensemaking up-hierarchy from the hylozoic zone?
Somewhere between **10^7 and 10^11 bits of information**.

## What are the three levels in the complex up-hierarchy architecture of perception described in "On Perception," moving from deeper to higher levels?
**Hylozoic zone**, **Bodily Space**, **Object Space**, and **Mind-Space**. (Note: I've listed the main levels. The source provides sub-levels within Bodily and Object Space.)

## What is the final level atop the sensemaking hierarchy in the up-hierarchy architecture of perception?
The **I-me-Mine Self Complex**.

## According to "On Perception," what are you participating with when you read?
A **shared simulation** that the author is also participating with in writing.

## What is the Zen notion of direct perception NOT meant to suggest? What is it more correct to say?
Not meant to suggest that we can **see the world as it is**. It is more correct to say that the **awakened state sees the perception for what it is**.

## What are three constraints on the degrees of freedom in the infinite field of participation that constitutes perception?
1. **Human species biology**. 2. **Individual physiology** (health and skill of perceptual organs). 3. **State-specific thresholds for conscious awareness**.

## In the Gelukba's Sautrantika view, what kind of thought can lead to direct perception? What is required for this possibility?
**Conceptual thought** can lead to direct perception, but this depends on having a **correct conceptual framework**.

## According to the Gelukba's framework, what do ultimate truths apprehend versus conceptual truths?
Ultimate truths apprehend "**specifically characterized, impermanent phenomena**," while conceptual truths apprehend "**generally characterized phenomena**".

## In the Gelukba's view, what is the primary ignorance that conceptions help overcome?
Not recognizing the **generalizing, categorizing, static and reifying nature of conceptual thought**.

## What does it mean to "perceive directly" according to "On Perception's" discussion of the Gelukba's view?
To "**engage with the entire collection of features**," being aware of the ecological field of participation from world to thought and back again.

## In the Gelukba system, how is each perceptual organ understood?
To be its own **consciousness** (eye consciousness, ear consciousness, etc.).

## According to the Sautrantika view, when are sensory and mental consciousnesses considered ultimate consciousnesses?
When **directly perceived**.

## According to "On Perception," where does the arousal drive originate at one end of the perceptual stream? What is its role?
In **affect-laden values**. It **primes perception with relevance** and provides the appetitive energies that drive the senses.

## When the arousal drive turns inward, what are the values discharged onto, constituting meaning and sensemaking?
**Images and semantic units**.

## According to "On Perception," what is the connection between internal and external value, and what serves as the bi-directional conduit?
**Perception** is the connection, and the **body** is the conduit.
