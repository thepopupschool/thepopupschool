# Awareness: Reflection, Recursivity, Reflexivity 2023 cohorts transcripts

## Cohort 1

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.020
thank you

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.700
[Music]

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.700
and good day everyone good morning good

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.780
afternoon good evening

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.740
um Okay so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
um we are going to be talking today

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.779
about

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.300
um

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.579
what's the title oh uh Reef awareness

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.860
reflection recursivity and reflexivity

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.980
so first we want to we're going to do an

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.160
exercise uh in a little bit

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.239
but first we want to uh just to find

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.340
those terms

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.460
uh start with

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.379
um so that we can control

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.120
our uh

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.439
so during the exercise we can filter out

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.500
what we're interested in most and what

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.619
we're not interested so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.520
um

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.920
we can start

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.320
we'll start with reflection

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.140
and there were two definitions of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.939
reflection

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.000
one was quite ordinary so when I say

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.360
okay let's say we just finished a game

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.479
of tennis and I'm your coach and we come

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.400
in okay let's reflect on what happened

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.140
right this is the common uh way of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.920
reflecting it's after the fact

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.939
um and what we notice is that it it has

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.700
mostly to do what we talked about when

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.220
we talked about memory right so we'll

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.399
remember some things uh some of the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.799
people that you know on the team some

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.740
things will be more Salient to them than

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.399
others so you get this kind of like

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.899
little hodgepodge of what people

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.760
remember

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.040
and then they will make sense of it

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.239
retrospectively they will update their

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.160
experience

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.879
um

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.640
in service of the moment so if it's a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.220
young team you will see that Johnny

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.980
what's Salient for him is when he lost

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.000
that match and it made a big deal and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.040
um somebody else might not have even

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.819
remembered that and then then Johnny's

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.760
will start to talk about have a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.040
reflection on

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.920
um that point which includes a lot of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.280
made up stuff in the moment right so

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.220
reflect that's what reflection is now

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.860
having characterized it that way

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.760
uh reflection or retrospective sense

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.200
making is very important because instead

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.900
of coming away from a game and just

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.140
being have different people have

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.379
different memories of it when you

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.599
reflect together or even when you

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
reflect in yourself you're basically

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.760
what you're doing is generating a new

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.980
starting position you're generating

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.260
another origin story well tomorrow's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.659
another day we have another match

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.940
So that's its function does that make

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.099
sense

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.580
um so instead of so it's helpful for us

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.860
as human beings to make retrospective

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.840
sense making that's our new starting

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.200
position and then we go forward we do

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.299
this very well in collectives and we

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.440
also do this to ourselves when uh when

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.340
uh

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.739
so we're not disoriented

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.560
um but it but this is Taps into memory

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.680
and Imagination filling in the blanks

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.680
with updating memory to serve the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.480
present moment does that make sense to

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.659
everyone

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.640
then there's this spiritual metaphysical

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.400
uh

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.199
notion of reflection as twinnness

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.440
um you know people will say that we are

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.740
a perfect reflection of

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.120
reality or this twinness

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.259
um this has a lot more to do with uh

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.139
pure abstraction that's something in the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.740
world has it is reflecting something in

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.259
us a deep pattern

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.220
um

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.620
um or the sense that we're interjecting

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.199
the abstraction from the world

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.360
so this is a kind of a metaphysical

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.720
thing we can talk about it later but

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.020
it's it's more speculative philosophy

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.020
and ideation uh we're not going to talk

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.240
too much about that today but this

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.540
notion of twinness uh the subject is a

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.400
perfect reflection of the object and

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.280
vice versa the finger the moon's

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.419
reflection in the uh the Water

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.540
we'll get to that probably later

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.460
um

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.139
but that's not what we're after today

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.259
then there's recursivity in our in our

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.380
experiment today you have you we want to

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.440
be careful we don't get we want to be

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.660
careful that we notice when we're in a

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.060
recursive Loop

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.120
so the recursive Loop is

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.960
um I notice that I can see this book

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.360
and then I can say well who's seeing the

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.639
book and then I say well okay my my mind

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.560
is seeing the book and then I said who

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.600
seeing my mind and then

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.020
I can get a recursive completely it's

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.440
not it doesn't stop uh you can go and

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.300
beta on something and I met on that and

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.360
then meta on that and then meta on that

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.300
and this notion of recursivity is a

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.479
process of property of the discursive

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.580
mind

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.740
um we want to notice when I send you

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.380
into the experiment when that happens

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.539
and you want to just try to exit it

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.400
breathe through that and start over

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.300
again

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.880
uh so

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.039
um now

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.020
when that happens you might be

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.120
interested in how does that happen what

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.419
are what are the properties that put me

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.240
into a recursive Loop or infinite

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.380
regress we we talk about that

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.639
um so you might want to notice

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.580
uh what's happening what is composing

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.860
this recursivity

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.580
um but you don't want to

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.060
um get sucked in into it

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.259
um

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.759
so uh

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.460
um so the snake eating its tail this

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.440
notion of

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.020
um

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.840
uh it's infinite regression is a kind of

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.300
recursivity

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.199
um there's nowhere out uh no matter how

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.120
meta you go on it

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.199
um

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.979
you can go meta on it like like I'm the

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:31.080
wit I'm the witness that's witnessing

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.840
the witness who's witnessing The

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.639
Experience

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.440
um but you notice you don't make any

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.720
progress because the structural

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.960
relationship is the same you've just

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.919
created this Hall of Mirrors so uh

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:48.479
that's something you might want to

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.639
notice does anybody have any questions

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:53.660
about that

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.780
yes Claudia

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.120
yeah I think I think my question refers

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.400
back a little bit to the reflection

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.380
um aspect because you were describing it

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.800
as reflecting on something in the past

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.660
um but that past can be

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.979
just

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:16.979
very like very immediately to the Past

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:19.740
and I'm just like I can notice that I

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.120
can have a thought about something and

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.060
what I'm doing is reflecting okay yeah

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.919
yeah so I don't know what that is no no

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:27.840
so this will be part of your experiment

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.080
are you reflecting except it's very very

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.260
very narrow isolation or are you doing

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.760
something else

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.520
so that's a very good ex

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.800
um this is what we're trying we're going

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.979
to try to uh

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:48.260
notice so that would still be reflecting

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.940
you will notice that some people's

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.080
experience if they can't slow down time

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.420
and be attentive to the space won't

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.519
think they're reflecting they'll think

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:02.279
there's something else going on

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:05.820
uh just because you have to be

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.620
you know a lot of what we've been doing

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.779
is slowing down like when we did with

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:12.779
memory slowing down opening the space ah

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.640
I see what's happening in between here

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.380
there's a memory but that's a thought

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.980
and so this is part of when I set you on

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.500
your experiment to be

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.080
be

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.380
uh Vigilant about and then I'll ask you

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.019
well how do you know

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:34.560
it has a biomarker of course we can't

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.620
know these things by making distinctions

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.440
because the distinctions themselves

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.899
languages too coarse grain but then we

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:45.360
can notice the biomarker

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.040
um so

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.959
so does that answer your question and

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:52.320
it's really a good question because uh

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.300
it's the yeah that we would call it

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.580
reflection

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.540
um in either case Justin

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.300
what I notice I do is I I do reflect to

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.240
see what's there and at a point I stop

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.580
and see what it feels like

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.880
and if any patterns or words show up for

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.459
those patterns

00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:17.519
um then I'll address that and then I I

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.839
reach a point where there are no words

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:20.459
and I just move into silence and I stay

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:23.220
there and I do that all the time

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.600
but I don't know if that's going better

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.399
because I'm not thinking in the silence

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:29.220
I'm allowing the products to be it's not

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.200
going better it's just it's just

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.600
occupying a different vantage point or

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.640
change it's a state change it's not

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.279
going meta would be

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.300
um

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.640
in that you know it's I wouldn't call

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.339
that going meta okay it does because you

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:46.260
don't get in a loop

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.140
um meta always exits the domain that

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.940
it's in and then you can exit that

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.160
domain so I can be doing religion and

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.800
then say what is doing religion I've

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.380
gotten that on it then I can say what is

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.440
doing the meta theory of religion like I

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.279
met on that and so this is kind of uh

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:07.500
more of the feeling so

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.100
um

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.899
so that's a good question what's a

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:12.540
biomarker anybody have a good definition

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.600
of a biomarker Claudia maybe you do

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.940
since you were not in your head yeah

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.120
well just a little movement of something

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.000
in the body my little movement like for

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.220
me sometimes the if I'm really attentive

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.440
that reflexive is a little a little

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.300
movement in them in the mind a little

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.120
movement yeah so you can experience it

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.860
as a

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.380
um when I'm when I'm remembering

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.620
something if I notice it my posture is

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.779
different my gestures are different I go

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:45.959
to different places in my mind

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:49.740
um if I'm imagining something it feels

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.440
different than remembering something it

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.600
feels different to imagine than to

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.200
remember it feels different to run than

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.440
to walk and so that's what I mean by a

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.920
biomarker you can start to get very well

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.339
acquainted with what muscles you're

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:10.079
using

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.940
um whether that's Intuition or

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:17.220
imagination or remembering or simulation

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.740
um or justification

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.620
um because they presence themselves in

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.200
the body in different ways they feel

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.480
different there's a there's a biomarker

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.820
you know when you're a kid and you're

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.920
about and you're kind of afraid your

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.320
mother said did you do that and you did

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.079
and uh you're about to tell a lie

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:42.839
how do you know it's a lie you can feel

00:12:42.839 --> 00:12:44.820
that you're about to tell a lie it has a

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.160
biomarker to it

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.120
um certain sociopaths don't have that

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.420
literally don't feel any difference in

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.000
their body between truth and lies most

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.160
people

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.740
it's a feeling you don't calculate it

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.740
you can feel the difference between so

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.360
that's what a biomarker is

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.420
okay

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.279
um

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:18.139
and then we have reflexivity which is

00:13:18.139 --> 00:13:22.380
sensefulness or mindful Heating

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.899
this is where you get out of the

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:26.519
reflection

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:29.700
and you're you're with everything in the

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.380
moment

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.459
um

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:35.339
so instead of in the article I put

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:38.399
instead of perception Gap sensation Gap

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:42.360
a little bit of motion Gap up memory Gap

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.480
you just you just

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.380
see them as seamless flows with a little

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.160
bit of

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.519
variety you feel the flux in the FL in

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:58.019
the flow

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:01.139
um And you're extra you're so you're

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:03.240
heating you're you're paying attention

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.779
but you're not after the moment you're

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:10.860
not behind the present experience

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.279
um so this is what meditation is this is

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:18.180
we're going to try to be in this uh

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.019
meditative posture called uh mindful

00:14:22.019 --> 00:14:23.420
Heating

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.139
so

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:29.279
um if you are facilitating a course

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:33.120
um you may understand that and there's a

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.940
lot of tension in the room you start to

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.399
you start to

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.920
a lot of things are hot processing at

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.199
the same time you might have your hands

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:45.060
like this and you want to make them

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.000
softer you want to make then and then

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.279
you might be pushing with your words and

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:51.860
you're noticing

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.320
you're noticing external cues in your

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.540
environment but you're also working your

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.120
body at the same time your words are

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.639
coming out of your mouth

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:03.660
um

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.079
um automatically and you're noticing the

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:09.360
effect of you know they affect it as

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.779
they arise uh when you work with

00:15:12.779 --> 00:15:16.680
horses uh at a high level

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.199
um it requires you to be very much in

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:21.180
the moment because if you're behind the

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.579
action you'll get hurt

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:28.380
um so uh mindful heating is

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.940
um

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.000
um

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.680
is in tune with all The Experience

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.480
interior and exterior as one Gestalt in

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.880
as much of the present moment as you can

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.959
and in the in the article I say you know

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:52.620
you're not distracted enough to label or

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.040
make something a thing uh because then

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.339
for minute period of time you'll have

00:15:59.339 --> 00:16:02.399
stop the flow like if someone got raise

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:04.260
their voice and then you're like oh he

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.779
always does that then you're behind the

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:10.800
action and then this makes us not as as

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.779
fluent so

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:16.199
mindful heating is what we're going to

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:19.199
try to do in this exercise

00:16:19.199 --> 00:16:20.820
um there's not except there's not that

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.639
much externally to be mindful of with

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:26.279
more of a meditation

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:28.260
um so

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.060
um

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.019
and then that brings us to this strange

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:38.360
word awareness now

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:40.380
how many of you have done meditation

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.440
practices called oh being aware of

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.139
awareness

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:48.240
have any of you taken some of those

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.480
Sandra Liz okay

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.259
so what just describe if you both could

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:58.880
take turns and describe what the

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.980
instructions were sort of like if you

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.150
can remember

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.339
[Music]

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.880
a really simple example might be

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.819
that your

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.520
noticing that you're judging

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.160
and then you're judging that you're

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.839
judging

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.620
and and you're just

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:28.860
tracking whatever is emerging in the

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.160
moment with as much as possible no

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.100
evaluation of it or no

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.900
um opinion but if you have an opinion

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.160
about it then you notice you're having

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.960
an opinion about it you let that go you

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.700
just keep letting go

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.240
and welcoming whatever is arising

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.960
next

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.940
say noticing what is noticing

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.900
yes so it's what Liz said and then it's

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.620
well then what's noticing

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.320
okay so looking for what's looking

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.799
noticing for what's noticing

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:15.240
noticing that yes exactly Raj this is

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.000
the question

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.760
that we are going to try to answer is

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.520
this recursivity what is this noticing

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.140
what's noticing looking for what's

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.120
looking

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.160
um

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:29.200
um

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.320
[Music]

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.520
and we're going to

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.020
all right

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.679
track this question down and where is my

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:46.020
perhaps we're gonna track this question

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.880
down

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.400
um and

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.140
that will be obviously one of the uh one

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.299
of the questions that we'll have okay

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:01.100
here are my my things so

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.880
um

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.620
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.900
um some of you will cheat and go to the

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.520
second thing because it's already on the

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.100
table that's okay

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.100
um but the first thing we're going to do

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:23.100
for 20 minutes is just sit with what are

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.760
we aware of okay so right now I'm aware

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.220
of a fan sound over there I'm aware of

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.980
this and we'll just mind be mindful

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.539
heating of what we're aware of

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:39.720
um so this is the easier phase

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.520
um and just try to relax and

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.299
um

00:19:45.299 --> 00:19:48.240
uh we'll we'll spend maybe just 15

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.299
minutes doing this and

00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:53.280
um we're not going to do this in

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.679
breakouts we'll do the second one in

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.900
breakouts oh Claudia go ahead

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.940
so if we're aware of thought we're just

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.100
aware of thought yes if you're aware of

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.559
that you're just aware of thoughts

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.059
um you don't have to label or anything

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.940
but just notice that

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.919
um

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:12.179
um

00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:13.919
you know you can notice a bunch of

00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.660
things you'll notice that as you become

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.960
aware your your attention moves a little

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.900
and different things

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.100
um and uh which is simple awareness that

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.799
um yeah that we can be aware of these

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:31.320
things if we were unconscious or

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.660
anesthetized

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.780
um my heart might be still beating but I

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.660
would not be aware that my heart is

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.460
beating

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:43.740
um so

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.320
um just notice

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.020
um that experience itself we're going to

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.340
turn off our videos for 15 minutes and

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.039
um just sit with ourselves just for 15

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:58.740
minutes in this simple exercise before

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.080
we go to the experiment

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.399
okay you can come back in when you're

00:31:26.399 --> 00:31:28.580
ready

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.779
thank you

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.799
um okay so we're going to do a series of

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:50.460
short uh exercises

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.460
that get will build on each other and

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.240
you'll do them in breakout groups so

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.820
you're going to have 15 minutes for the

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.820
breakout groups you can use this first

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.220
exercise uh

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.679
if you want to debrief with your

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:10.799
breakout group and Orient around it

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:14.340
um but try to stay within the boundaries

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.580
of each exercise because I think it will

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.580
they'll build on each other more than if

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.539
you uh Jump Ahead having said that

00:32:24.539 --> 00:32:27.720
sometimes you have to just say what you

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.659
need to say okay so in this first

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:33.200
exercise

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:37.380
um which will last for 10 minutes uh let

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.120
me put that in there that it's because

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.880
these are very easy so we'll do a little

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.840
quick

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.380
you're going to um

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.960
you're going to put you're going to be

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.600
aware of your breathing

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.580
right you know what that means simply

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.559
just aware of your breathing

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:58.260
and you're going to ask yourself

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.710
what is it that is aware of my breathing

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.399
[Music]

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:05.039
or how is it that I am aware of my

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.840
breathing

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.799
and you will notice

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:12.799
um

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.159
um see if you can notice an oscillation

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:21.000
between the first just being aware of

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.700
your breathing and then trying to be

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.740
aware of how it is that you're aware of

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.360
the breathing now you may oscillate

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.860
because you'll say okay now I'm going to

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.440
ask my question well that's a thought

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.019
that's an oscillation I was aware of my

00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:36.240
breathing and then I reminded myself to

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.820
switch that's an oscillation but then C

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.640
as you're then going back to trying to

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.240
be aware of your breathing whereas where

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.519
is the oscillation

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:49.860
or not does that kind of make sense you

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.840
can help each other out

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.779
um so don't quite get that you're aware

00:33:54.779 --> 00:33:57.480
of your breathing and then your have a

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.100
thought you're aware of your breathing I

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.080
mean it seems to me the same thing but

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.140
uh okay right so there if I'm aware of

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.179
my breathing and then I remember okay I

00:34:06.179 --> 00:34:08.040
want to go to the second part of the ex

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.440
of the the thing well there's an

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.119
oscillation between them or where am I

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:13.500
breathing and then I have the thought

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.839
and I noticed I stopped being aware of

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:17.280
my breathing when I went to the thought

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.220
right

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.099
so that's an oscillation that one's

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:25.260
rather trivial now I'm going to go back

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.619
to the exercise where I'm trying to be

00:34:28.619 --> 00:34:31.379
aware of my breathing

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:33.960
and I'm going to ask myself well what is

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.240
aware what is being aware of my

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.599
breathing

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.859
is is this is what else is it and

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:47.040
and I might go in and out of thought but

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.899
there might be another oscillation there

00:34:48.899 --> 00:34:52.080
that's much more subtle

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.280
um okay so uh and you know work it out

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.760
together so uh you're in with uh someone

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.980
who's done a lot of this work I think so

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.359
that the system knows how to uh

00:35:06.359 --> 00:35:08.940
knows how to set these guys up okay it's

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.680
just 10 minutes and we'll come back so

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.260
it's okay it ends in confusion it's just

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.680
10 minutes

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.599
foreign

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.980
foreign

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.820
any questions comments or shares

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.949
[Music]

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
I noticed a lot of

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.320
contrast like precision expansiveness

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.480
thinking feeling

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.260
personal experiential

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:16.700
my breath does not like this exercise

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.140
doesn't want to be

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.960
objectified in a way

00:38:36.359 --> 00:38:39.540
I think going into a observation or

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.420
awareness

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.520
shifts my

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.520
um

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.460
my my participating in and with breath

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.680
into something that is

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.680
separating

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.160
and then it changes the nature

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.400
yeah at first I found it hard to

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.180
ask the question and stay with a kind of

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.099
deep awareness of the breath the

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:24.839
question would

00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:27.480
would take me away from the awareness of

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.960
the breath

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.180
yeah these are all isolations that we're

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.800
not noticing

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.260
so this is good this is we're trying to

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.020
build on on this

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.640
I noticed that um

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.560
I am typically very aware of the

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.300
experience that the breathing is having

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.099
on my body and not aware of the

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:55.020
breathing itself

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.079
so at least initially to pay attention

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:00.780
to breathing of itself was it irritating

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.480
because it's required a kind of focus

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.339
that where I typically know doesn't

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:07.440
exist

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.859
but uh we ended up in Great Space we did

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:13.680
it quieted there was

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.020
salt and caressing at the end

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.400
yeah that was interesting I also noticed

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.579
in the last few minutes my breathing

00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:30.300
started to get very deep and steady

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.380
of its own accord

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.560
I stayed with it

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.460
um

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.680
deepened actually the participation with

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.540
the breath that actually activated my

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.339
imagination quite a bit

00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:48.839
and then somehow that kind of actually

00:40:48.839 --> 00:40:50.579
deepened my participation with the

00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:52.260
breath gave me kind of a different

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.119
perspective imagination started to

00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:56.099
activate

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:58.800
okay good there's another oscillation

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:02.900
from just being with the breath

00:41:08.579 --> 00:41:10.740
okay we're gonna go on is that is anyone

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.980
else

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.960
your comments or Instagram yeah

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.200
[Music]

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.660
hi everyone

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.830
um

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.420
[Music]

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.540
it was a hard really a hard thing it was

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.540
like I I was thinking oh

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.619
I have to move into search space

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:41.820
and that in and of itself kind of then

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.240
makes me Focus which takes away this

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.180
kind of expanded appearance so

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.839
that those who are oscillations and then

00:41:51.839 --> 00:41:54.359
uh

00:41:54.359 --> 00:41:58.140
I I I saw that it was quite impossible

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.540
to answer that question

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.900
so I stayed with the impossibility

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:09.119
and then the breathing and

00:42:09.119 --> 00:42:13.740
whatever is aware of breathing kind of

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.040
resolved in a in a sweet and Blissful

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.320
mood

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.900
kind of

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.200
yeah yeah there's some cues in here so

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.599
I'll just we'll just keep building on it

00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:30.060
there's a lot of cues in here

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.119
um

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.180
I'm tempering my own enthusiasm

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.720
so we can go into the next next round is

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.060
there something else that hasn't been

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.060
said in one version or another

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.180
yeah

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.700
oh Raj go ahead

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.440
uh okay

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.200
um so there was an awareness

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.720
or maybe a thought of

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.119
my own breathing but then the four of us

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:08.640
a share breathing which felt at least

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.819
easier for me to observe external then

00:43:11.819 --> 00:43:13.260
of course I had this thought of

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.700
entanglement

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.339
and the entanglement of breathing

00:43:17.339 --> 00:43:18.119
um

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:21.020
as I thought

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.859
one way I experienced the oscillation I

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:34.200
think was when I tried to come with this

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.000
question of what is the way of depressed

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.280
and then I had to like speak it in my

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.040
mind silently

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.900
oh

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.000
you know a place up to yeah and then

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.140
then there was a completely different

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.800
this was interesting yeah so and then

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.440
to to be able to need to do that in a

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.060
way to to the second part

00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:04.020
um I think I I will add

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.079
um

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.839
I experienced much like motion

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:14.280
experience this restlessness to find

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.000
and

00:44:17.099 --> 00:44:19.560
when the three of us were

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.380
sharing about it there was this sense

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.800
that it was a burden somehow

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.040
but for me it wasn't burdensome the

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.300
oscillation Was Juicy in that there was

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.819
a uh

00:44:35.819 --> 00:44:38.099
this kind of

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:40.859
wanting to explore the breath leaving

00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:44.060
the breath wanting to explore back into

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.300
and of course I am very much aware that

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.800
there was an instruction in the exercise

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:58.160
so and it felt juicy to dive into that

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:02.280
good so we know what we can essentially

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.200
in oscillations everyone's really good

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.579
at this

00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:06.900
um

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.040
um

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.760
which is great mindful heating so you

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.339
know when I think of this question I can

00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:16.140
be aware of my breathing

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.760
I did it too

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.560
then I thought what if I stopped

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.780
breathing then I'm aware of my not

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.260
breathing

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.300
but then I realized I could be either

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.520
breathing or not breathing and not be

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.640
aware of it like

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.460
um you know when you're just washing the

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.560
dishes you're either breathing or not

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.579
breathing

00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:42.800
uh and you're not aware of it

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.480
so

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.880
what's the difference

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.839
what's the difference

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:53.240
um

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:55.940
can I say one more thing Bonnie I just

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.079
worked when David

00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:00.540
um spoke that there's a

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.660
I noticed uh in in that shifting from

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.180
awareness to what is aware the question

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.079
it's almost like if I could slip that

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:13.079
question in fast enough I I wouldn't

00:46:13.079 --> 00:46:16.140
break the awareness but I would expand

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.240
the awareness

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.420
yeah so there's a trick here

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.420
um and and this is all very good please

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.060
don't jump to conclusions and this next

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.500
one is

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.540
um okay now this one

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:33.720
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.060
be aware of different things coming into

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.220
our awareness like some of you already

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.720
did that I was aware of the breath and

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.060
then in my imagination

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.900
and the question I want and it's

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.800
actually motion kind of uh went into

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.760
this there's a sense of

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.380
um

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.260
I want you to every time you something

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.440
comes into your awareness that you've

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.660
already familiar with whether it's a

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.319
thought or bodily sensation or

00:47:07.319 --> 00:47:10.940
imagination or memory or

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.440
dispositional State you know Phoebe said

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.480
my breath didn't like it that wasn't

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.140
switching your dispositional state

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.859
um so it's a complex mix of bodily

00:47:22.859 --> 00:47:24.960
Sensations

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.040
um

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.680
all these things you want to recognize

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.480
and you want to put them aside and say

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.099
no I'm not interested in that I'm

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.619
interested in the thing that's aware

00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:37.619
you just keep putting them aside

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:40.619
putting them aside

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:42.660
this is like what Liz says and if I

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.880
could be really like if I could put them

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:48.180
aside and reveal that which is aware of

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.579
them this is the kind of game you're

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:52.740
playing with yourself okay it's an

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.619
instruction it's a it is these are games

00:47:55.619 --> 00:47:57.180
like

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.900
um so so last time we were interested in

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.400
the oscillation first time we're

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.680
interested in what is an awareness

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.880
Dennis interest in the oscillations now

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.579
we're just gonna

00:48:10.579 --> 00:48:12.780
those kinds of things we're already

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.280
familiar with

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.740
we just say I'm not no it's not

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.040
interested and I'm interested in

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:24.000
what is aware of that you know so

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.440
um

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.940
and then try to uh it can be a little

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.940
reflective uh but try to uh

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.760
experience what this exercise brings up

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.800
for you that's all I'm going to say so

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.599
does everybody understand the

00:48:42.599 --> 00:48:44.640
instruction I mean literally it can be

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.440
like a game

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.500
um

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.740
what we're trying to figure out is can

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.359
we be aware

00:48:54.359 --> 00:48:56.400
of something that's other than all those

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.260
things and

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.220
um

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:03.420
or try to like Liz said if I could just

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.300
look behind

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:09.960
what I'm aware of and see the awareness

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.579
directly

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:13.500
okay

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.339
we'll go 15 minutes and uh let me change

00:49:17.339 --> 00:49:20.119
that on this

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:23.280
and I love the way you're holding this

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.660
more like attending and not like really

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.520
uh driving yourself crazy that's what we

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.660
learned a little while ago about

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.380
attending to experience is a very rich

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.119
way to

00:49:36.119 --> 00:49:39.119
um to move through these kinds of funny

00:49:39.119 --> 00:49:41.400
questions about being a human okay have

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.640
fun

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.300
foreign

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:26.040
foreign

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.660
[Music]

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.319
yeah I I ended with a thought about this

00:52:13.319 --> 00:52:15.619
kind of recursive thing like

00:52:15.619 --> 00:52:19.079
why is it lurking where am I not seeing

00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:21.540
it like in the exercise having

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.579
difficulty if I'm actually doing it

00:52:23.579 --> 00:52:26.579
right awareness of awareness okay and

00:52:26.579 --> 00:52:28.500
like um

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.839
like like then more like feeling like

00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:33.359
when they're reflective reflexivity mode

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:35.520
like we had before like in the beginning

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.859
I felt like it was there and then but

00:52:37.859 --> 00:52:40.319
trying to exercise it confuses me and

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:42.900
then I'm not sure I can like

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:46.079
um have an answer for that like I don't

00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:50.119
know in a way confused

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.940
yeah no every instruction has different

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:55.680
uh

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.020
different consequences so that's that's

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:02.520
that's fair it's a fair share

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.480
um

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.619
so this one sets you up to

00:53:06.619 --> 00:53:10.500
tends to make it more recursive

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.780
all right good

00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:15.059
Claudia

00:53:15.059 --> 00:53:17.040
yeah but I was actually comparing it to

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.319
the kind of direct recursive you know

00:53:19.319 --> 00:53:21.480
looking for what's looking where

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.000
there's a clear for me and nothing there

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.160
but with this one

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.760
because it I was I wasn't asking what is

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.260
aware of aware but what is aware of

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:33.960
breathing and kind of saying no to

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.900
everything that I found I there was a

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.180
kind of something there it felt a bit

00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.160
different to the yeah

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.240
to the recursive

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.540
yeah the place was like it's it's a game

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.900
this is a game like let's have fun and

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.359
be serious but it that's kind of where I

00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:59.280
ended up

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:01.440
yeah no I love the attitude toward it

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.640
you know

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.220
um what we're honing in on are some

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.800
metaphysical claims that the Buddhists

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.180
make

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.599
um which we haven't brought up yet but

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:13.559
um

00:54:13.559 --> 00:54:14.520
um

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:18.960
yeah so uh

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.599
this is all good

00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:24.079
okay

00:54:24.359 --> 00:54:27.240
go ahead motion oh okay

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:30.240
um uh what came up for me was I

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.680
remembered 1980 the famous old zen way

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.960
of

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.880
negativa not this not this this is how I

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.559
heard the instruction

00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:44.700
and how I interpret it so anything that

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:46.619
came up for me as

00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:49.140
now this could be a win so this could be

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.260
I just said no no no no no no no no no

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.140
no no

00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:55.859
and

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.859
um

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.339
kante ended up but there there was the

00:55:02.339 --> 00:55:05.160
there is this pervasive sense of

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.000
well-being

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.420
um

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:14.579
of well-being here like and

00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:16.760
um

00:55:18.119 --> 00:55:20.940
and also the question cannot be answered

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:25.140
so you know why try that doesn't really

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.079
make sense because that is to be thrown

00:55:28.079 --> 00:55:31.920
away as well anything that can be the

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:34.800
answer cannot be the answer any object

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.339
cannot be the subject so

00:55:38.339 --> 00:55:39.420
um

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.260
so it was quite fun and I'm very much in

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.180
a very beautiful

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:45.900
um

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.079
round space

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:52.520
it feels pretty good

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.420
I thought it was fascinating I could

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:01.859
I could be aware of Sensations occurring

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:04.260
but the moment I thought to do anything

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.180
I wasn't there anymore so there is the

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.920
awareness and it is fascinating that

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.460
could be aware of what was going on

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.720
but any thought any impulse any action

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.359
removed me from that space which was

00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:21.140
interesting

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:29.480
and who was aware that that was the case

00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:31.920
that's an unanswerable question as far

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.520
as I'm concerned

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.220
that's exactly why I gave up on the

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.319
Hindu question who am I years and years

00:56:40.319 --> 00:56:41.819
and years ago because I don't think it's

00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:45.200
an answerable question yeah

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.520
okay well I'm going to insert something

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.240
and maybe

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:54.540
um well

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:56.160
um years and years ago when I was in

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.640
theology school I um

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.180
I read somebody was asked

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.400
how do you pray

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.260
and he answered

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:12.059
oh I look at God and God looks at me

00:57:12.059 --> 00:57:14.280
so I thought hmm

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.300
maybe I'll try that

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:22.260
so I sat there trying to look at God

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:23.819
and it was similar to what you were

00:57:23.819 --> 00:57:27.000
saying Motion in the sense that

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.619
I kept having to go back and go back and

00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:33.780
go back you know whatever it was I was

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.420
looking with that ain't gonna see God so

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.240
I gotta go back further and further and

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.160
further and

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.400
and it wasn't that I saw God

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.440
if there is such a thing

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:49.440
but it was

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.059
um

00:57:51.059 --> 00:57:54.020
that I

00:57:54.599 --> 00:57:56.700
putting myself

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.640
in a position to see whatever whatever

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.859
that might be

00:58:01.859 --> 00:58:04.619
allowed me to um

00:58:04.619 --> 00:58:07.079
I'm losing my words here

00:58:07.079 --> 00:58:08.880
um

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.339
sort of

00:58:10.339 --> 00:58:13.380
catalyzed me

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:18.000
into further and further reaches of

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.440
um

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.420
of

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.760
what I don't how I don't know myself to

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:26.540
be kind of

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.260
and I have a question about this

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.619
exercise

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:35.780
um

00:58:37.799 --> 00:58:39.960
motion you said you experienced a

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.440
well-being I was going to sleep now part

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.700
of that is

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:48.920
um tiredness and part of it is

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.280
that um

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.440
in the absence of

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.619
um

00:59:01.619 --> 00:59:04.200
a way to look at God to use that

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.640
language

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:09.420
and in the absence of

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.180
being awake to

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.180
um

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.160
to what's there if the void gets bigger

00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.920
and bigger and I and I don't yet have a

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:24.180
way to cohere in relationship with that

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.140
then I think

00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:31.380
okay I'm way off in an exploratory land

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.640
and I don't I know what I'm talking

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.960
about

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.720
um but I but there are times when

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.380
there's such a sense of

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.900
of coherence and aliveness

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:47.160
that is also inviting me to let go and

00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.140
let go and let go and let go and then

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:52.020
there's other times when I don't have

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:54.059
that sense of

00:59:54.059 --> 00:59:56.180
um

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:59.579
connectivity or something where there's

00:59:59.579 --> 01:00:02.599
a devolution

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:04.799
of

01:00:04.799 --> 01:00:08.040
awareness or Devolution of being

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.619
so that's

01:00:10.619 --> 01:00:12.260
a bunch of probably

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.660
unexplored thoughts but

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.200
okay

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.780
we went out of that uh a bit

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.940
when

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:53.460
it just opened up

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.799
into all of a sudden the thought of

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:01.319
the war on the planet

01:01:01.319 --> 01:01:05.099
then I thought on my daily chores

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:06.839
and I went back

01:01:06.839 --> 01:01:08.460
in

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:14.099
and I noticed Sensations in my gut

01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:16.559
and I worked on bringing back into the

01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:19.819
breath and bringing it up

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:24.680
and that and then

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:29.880
so to me this is just

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.020
pure meditation

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.240
but

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.380
analyzing it

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.339
it's rather beautiful

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:53.520
I have this experience of being in a

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.160
maze that's unsolvable no matter what

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.200
turn you go to

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.460
and

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.140
um

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.140
perhaps just the urge to sit in the

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:07.760
acceptance of being an amazed

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.180
mm-hmm

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.520
personally I was feeling I didn't want

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.859
to think about the maze I wanted to

01:02:22.859 --> 01:02:24.660
be active in it like I wanted to

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:27.000
participate in it the thinking was

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.900
really

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.099
I was starting to get Restless

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.960
so for me in the first round it started

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.599
out pretty simple it was like okay be

01:02:42.599 --> 01:02:44.520
aware of my breathing how is it that I'm

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.319
aware of my breathing

01:02:46.319 --> 01:02:50.040
and so I could be aware of the qualities

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.460
of my breaths I could be aware that

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.799
breathing in breathing out since the

01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:56.800
physical sensation

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.099
[Music]

01:02:59.099 --> 01:03:00.839
um but then moving to the next question

01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:04.819
what is being aware of my breathing

01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:06.980
um

01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:11.780
they're the thing that came up was how

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:17.059
I I I'm aware

01:03:18.299 --> 01:03:21.240
my awareness shifts and that's one of

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.140
the ways that I I know my awareness that

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.020
if if it's here and then it's there and

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.020
then and so in the second round asking

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:35.880
us to just be aware of

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.480
um to focus on awareness itself

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.480
that took on a life of its own where I

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:44.460
started becoming curious about what

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.059
moves the the awareness

01:03:48.059 --> 01:03:49.859
and

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.299
um

01:03:51.299 --> 01:03:55.440
and and this notion that

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.140
you know the awareness can be directed

01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.880
and then of course the question well

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.559
what's doing that

01:04:01.559 --> 01:04:03.059
but it

01:04:03.059 --> 01:04:06.240
but then it's not just directing

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.700
awareness it's awareness also can be

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.440
called

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:15.540
and when I when I S was

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.079
able to see the the

01:04:19.079 --> 01:04:25.260
that movement of sort of we can

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.900
there can be agency with awareness and

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.599
then awareness can be

01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:34.500
can be called there is sort of like an

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:36.619
interior exterior

01:04:36.619 --> 01:04:39.660
all the boundaries started to blur for

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.220
me but it it there was there was this

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.480
um

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.640
the language starts to break down but

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.960
there was a sense of how my awareness is

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.960
alive and in participation

01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.740
um

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:02.480
with the world something

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.339
right say the entangled

01:05:11.339 --> 01:05:14.119
meant

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.520
commenting is important

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:23.460
um so a lot of times depending how it's

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:24.660
set up

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.960
so first we notice we all notice now

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.839
that the instructions are you're

01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:34.760
participating with instructions

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:39.059
um and and I'm not trying to do any

01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:42.900
subtle Mojo mumble jumble but when you

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.859
are in a meditative practice in a in a

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:48.059
culture

01:05:48.059 --> 01:05:50.640
in a tradition

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.859
um a lot of times you're not aware of

01:05:52.859 --> 01:05:56.940
how much the outcome is predetermined uh

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.579
by the instructions

01:05:59.579 --> 01:06:01.200
um so

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.200
um and I remember Thomas uh Arthur even

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.880
said well your instructions are like

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.160
that too yeah but I'm not trying to have

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.140
them build up to anything

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.040
I mean it's always a catch-22 so

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.680
um you're in a dispositional state it's

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.880
primed by the instruction

01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:23.220
um and then

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:24.299
um

01:06:24.299 --> 01:06:26.760
that's like an arousal we know arousal

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.339
energy has its own value right like you

01:06:29.339 --> 01:06:32.579
want to satisfy uh you want a certain

01:06:32.579 --> 01:06:34.920
satisfaction satisfy the instruction or

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:38.039
whatever so it is simple basic level

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:41.039
where we haven't exited the actual

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.920
formula of the sensory motor self it's

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:46.500
the same does that make sense it's the

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.859
same thing we have a dispositional state

01:06:48.859 --> 01:06:51.059
uh we're looking for a certain

01:06:51.059 --> 01:06:53.220
satisfaction because we want to play the

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.780
game

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.859
um and so it sends us out on a journey

01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:02.640
in this case though we're not using our

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.339
physical perception in between right

01:07:05.339 --> 01:07:08.280
we're not looking

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.940
like if I say oh find the ad uh we're

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:17.339
using a different thing to look right

01:07:17.339 --> 01:07:19.260
um and I don't mean it it's hard

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:21.180
language is hard because I don't even

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.140
mean it's a thing

01:07:24.359 --> 01:07:26.460
um but we're exercising

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.000
something else and

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.020
what and so Marie

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.359
uh was very good at noticing even the

01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:38.039
oscillation is a movement it's a

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:42.539
movement from attending to this to

01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:45.720
whatever that is that is trying to

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.579
figure out what's doing the attending

01:07:47.579 --> 01:07:51.900
okay so the the basic muscle we're using

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.700
is this

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:57.240
muscle that moves uh that's trying to

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.579
solve uh

01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:02.220
the instruction

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:06.180
we don't know what what will satisfy

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.319
we're just

01:08:07.319 --> 01:08:10.200
moving around until we find something

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.180
that satisfies and no one's been

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.160
satisfied right no it's like it's

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.799
impossible I'm in a maze no one's been

01:08:16.799 --> 01:08:20.819
satisfied uh uh by their experience

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:24.839
which is good so

01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:28.319
some things if you the if you practice

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:29.400
this

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:34.319
that are very subtle one is is that

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.799
foreign

01:08:37.699 --> 01:08:41.339
is is that in order to do the exercise

01:08:41.339 --> 01:08:43.920
we end we

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.839
enter in a we enter in a mental model

01:08:48.839 --> 01:08:52.560
so there is a subtle imputation of a

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.319
mental model so what I mean by this this

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:57.420
notion is that the thing that's looking

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:59.880
is behind the other thing

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.299
right it's cross-modal metaphor it's a

01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:05.160
mental model right

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.440
I mean I get it that's how we relate to

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.620
it but you can understand we take a

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:14.400
relationship from the external world we

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.359
create a metaphor that it must be behind

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:19.319
it

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:22.500
because if I'm ahead of you I can't look

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.420
at you so the thing doing the looking

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.160
must be behind

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.040
so we've entered a simulation does that

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.000
make sense

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.400
we're already in a mental simulation

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.920
based on Cross modal synthesis of

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:38.000
concrete reality

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:41.940
in here in this simulation we're trying

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:45.420
to look for something and if we find

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.719
something likely in a simulation what

01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.819
must it be

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:53.520
a simulation

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.239
right so some people I say to them

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:59.580
what's doing the looking

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.980
and they experience the thing that's so

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.360
when you're looking you might have

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:08.460
noticed you go here you go here you go

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.800
here your eyes are actually looking

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.860
around your tensions moving around as if

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.120
you're in a box looking for something

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.719
um so these kinds of instructions tend

01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:25.199
to make you think that what you find is

01:10:25.199 --> 01:10:27.840
reified because you're already in a

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:30.120
simulation

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.920
um so some people think oh my God the

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.920
thing that's looking is awareness

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.460
um and uh and the it's not a thing it's

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.620
it's you've created

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.199
in your simulation you've created the

01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:45.420
thing that's looking

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:48.300
you've simulated the man behind the

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.300
curtain

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.980
uh so

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.860
um the first order simulation is is okay

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.659
I mean

01:10:57.659 --> 01:10:59.580
when we do mental

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.920
uh

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.020
um work we have to enter simulation

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.900
because it's mental work right I have to

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.940
simulate if I'm trying to calculate if

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.800
I'm trying to write the alphabet

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.900
backwards I have to run a simulation

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.659
where I see a z and then a y and x so we

01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:17.460
know we can simulate our environment

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.520
this is not exceptional other animals

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.960
can stimulate an environment

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:26.820
um

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.520
then we have linguistic convention that

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.580
if something is aware then if there's a

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.560
is there if there's a verb happening

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.360
this experiencing

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.580
we have a linguistic convention that

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.800
it's not possible for there not to be a

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.199
subject of that verb that's also very

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:45.620
difficult

01:11:45.659 --> 01:11:48.420
modern Neuroscience tells us and it's

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.520
really cool it's getting it's very hard

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.520
for us to so you see this you see this

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.760
conversation in the neurosciences

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.140
philosophy of Neuroscience

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.560
and so for example

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.699
um if I move my hand

01:12:05.699 --> 01:12:07.739
and I'm aware I've moved my hand are

01:12:07.739 --> 01:12:09.900
those two different things

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.199
and it's actually the second thing I'm

01:12:13.199 --> 01:12:16.320
aware of moving my hand if it's it if

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.260
it's reflective this is what Claudia

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.679
said could be behind the action

01:12:22.679 --> 01:12:26.400
um if somebody says well you know if I

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.699
can't if I sat you know so

01:12:29.699 --> 01:12:31.140
so

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.199
how you know have feeling a sensation

01:12:34.199 --> 01:12:36.300
and The Sensation are the same thing

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.820
being aware of the sensation and The

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:42.000
Sensation are the same thing

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.900
if a surgeon Cuts me I don't have it's

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.719
not that I'm not

01:12:48.719 --> 01:12:51.480
there's a sensation and I'm not aware of

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:52.260
it

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.620
there's just not the sensation there's a

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.360
sensation and the awareness of a

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.600
sensation are the same thing you can't

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.000
have a sensation over here and then not

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.159
be aware of it

01:13:05.159 --> 01:13:07.620
it's this need for us to put a subject

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:09.060
in an object

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.219
always at the same time

01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:15.000
but awareness moves around so if if I'm

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.820
aware of over here I might not be aware

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.800
of that

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.159
um so so these are are

01:13:23.159 --> 01:13:25.440
um some of the things that come up in

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.780
this conversation

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.900
um

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:33.659
and now what we understand and you know

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:35.880
this is just the first module but we're

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.040
trying to put the Mind back into the

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.440
body and the body in back into nature

01:13:44.060 --> 01:13:48.120
what we do that other animals this is

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.080
one of the things that is exceptional is

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.860
not that we are aware of awareness

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:59.400
this is this this is what you all were

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.219
very good at not saying I'm aware of

01:14:02.219 --> 01:14:04.560
awareness

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.679
um

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.340
what but so a lot of things times in

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:14.219
these these the the conclusions is what

01:14:14.219 --> 01:14:15.780
separates us from the other animals is

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.360
that we're aware of awareness which is

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.940
not true and it's not true that the

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.920
other animals are not aware because they

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.980
have Sensations and it's the same thing

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:29.100
but what is true is that we simulate

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:32.520
ourselves in our minds

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.100
so not only can we simulate environments

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.080
like other animals and then simulate

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:40.199
imaginative things and simulate all

01:14:40.199 --> 01:14:42.960
kinds of stories and narratives we

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.490
simulate ourselves in our mind

01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:46.640
[Music]

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:49.140
and then we say that's the thing that's

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:50.219
aware

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.620
it's like a little homunculus

01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:55.199
that we've simulated in our mind we

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.239
virtualized the subject object

01:14:57.239 --> 01:15:00.000
relationship between ourselves and the

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.280
world with a

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.820
subject object

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:07.380
relationship to

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.560
thoughts in our head our simulations

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.960
and we conclude that there's something

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.739
that's aware of all these things

01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:18.960
so it's like a second or third order

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.719
simulation

01:15:21.719 --> 01:15:22.320
um

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.540
and this makes us human

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:29.580
and actually creates all kinds of yeah

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.659
so let language which is first

01:15:33.659 --> 01:15:36.380
that we have a subject object language

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:39.120
or we have this subject object

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.900
simulation they kind of like

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:45.120
co-rise and then and then

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:48.360
um make and and then and then amplify

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.460
each other you know

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.199
um so

01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:53.100
um

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:56.699
some people say in the in the in like in

01:15:56.699 --> 01:15:58.500
the navajos and some of the Tibetan

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.659
languages they have verb languages and

01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:02.400
they actually don't have the same

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.620
simulation

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:05.159
um

01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:07.020
I think

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.480
didn't start with language I think it

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:11.699
started with the axial age when we could

01:16:11.699 --> 01:16:13.199
think with thoughts in our head and then

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:17.280
we started simulating and language got

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:21.300
subject you know it's both neither of

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.980
them help us

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.540
that's why we can't talk about it

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.159
because even if I talk about it if I say

01:16:26.159 --> 01:16:30.659
what is that which what is that that is

01:16:30.659 --> 01:16:32.340
aware I can't ask the question without

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.920
without positing a subject as if there's

01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:37.560
something something there

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.520
um

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.179
um but uh

01:16:42.179 --> 01:16:45.540
yeah but we also so we simulate our

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.460
selves in our mind

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:50.659
and if we're not aware of the simulation

01:16:50.659 --> 01:16:55.640
and most people in the world uh live in

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.199
the

01:16:57.199 --> 01:17:01.260
live inside live from the person they've

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.060
simulated in their mind and from the

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:06.659
reality that they've simulated around it

01:17:06.659 --> 01:17:09.000
um and

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.060
um

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.199
because and then they give it a

01:17:13.199 --> 01:17:15.239
narrative structure in all this and so

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:18.420
this is the concept of

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:22.760
um of samsara in Buddhism

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.960
um

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.440
etc etc so just being aware I think you

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.719
all shook your head you know that just

01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:32.880
to get into the game you have to enter a

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.780
simulation so whatever you find uh will

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:40.080
be uh something that's simulated in your

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.400
mind

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.140
um and some of you had great things like

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.199
I'm in a maze you know that that was a

01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:48.840
a metaphorical Creation in your mind but

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.360
some people sometimes in certain things

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.980
say

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:55.560
you know I see admire

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.199
you know the witness I found the witness

01:17:58.199 --> 01:18:00.659
I discovered the witness the witness is

01:18:00.659 --> 01:18:01.920
something that's

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.560
somehow in the

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:07.320
as a little reified thing

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.080
that's very special

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.940
um

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.860
etc etc

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.199
so to me to understand what you're

01:18:16.199 --> 01:18:18.840
saying is giving us freedom

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.340
I mean to understand that we're

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:23.420
simulating all this

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:27.480
yeah and also though to

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.100
um yeah I mean knowing that you

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.739
simulated and getting out of the Trap of

01:18:31.739 --> 01:18:34.199
simulation is

01:18:34.199 --> 01:18:38.820
uh two different two different things so

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.820
um

01:18:43.739 --> 01:18:46.440
I think you're reminded of of a pretty

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.800
uh a number of pretty good games we can

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.500
play with ourselves to get a kind of a

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.739
simulation that's for

01:18:55.739 --> 01:18:58.560
satisfactory

01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.719
um

01:18:59.719 --> 01:19:03.300
and and I mean for for me

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.980
um

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.699
being okay with in the second time it

01:19:08.699 --> 01:19:11.580
being a really quite okay with that

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.640
there was no it that is it

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.540
um

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:19.380
that felt really so good and so but to

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.480
get there I needed to follow the game I

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.840
needed to enter the simulation

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.179
um I needed to enter the simulation so

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:29.400
much so that it was not a simulation

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.080
anymore

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.080
um to then find this sense of pervasive

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.480
sense of well-being

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.140
um

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.500
which I call the Continuum yeah

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.560
because that continues so that continues

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.340
whatever but anyway so that's an

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.679
abstraction we run this simulation so

01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:52.260
that we can be aware of it we can be

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.600
aware of our Jam boards and we can be

01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:57.000
aware of a lot of simulations and

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.580
simulations are useful

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.640
um

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.260
and then

01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:06.360
it gets you know you can play around

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.219
with this for a lot because some people

01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:10.620
have existential crises when they

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.040
realize there's nothing behind that

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.219
and so they call it you know the void or

01:20:17.219 --> 01:20:20.480
something but but

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.320
the

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.600
the conclusion there's nothing behind

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:27.840
that is is in a simulation

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.360
behind behind what it's it's it's

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.239
it's it's like watching a movie and

01:20:36.239 --> 01:20:37.860
being so attached to one of the

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.020
characters that died that you never want

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.020
to live anymore and you know it's like

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.239
okay well it was fun to play the game

01:20:45.239 --> 01:20:47.699
but uh

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:49.380
um

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.620
you know

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:55.020
forget and you forget that the game

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.580
itself was

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.159
simulated so this this is something to

01:20:59.159 --> 01:21:03.020
really pay attention to because

01:21:04.739 --> 01:21:06.960
there's a lot of

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.540
um religious revivalism happening in the

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.760
world because because as the world gets

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.560
really bad that's one of our go-to

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.020
things so you have a lot of young people

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.080
going back to Christianity and and this

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.280
is all all okay as long as we understand

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.380
the power of the imagination in the

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.440
power of ritual on the power of these

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.280
things without reifying

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.620
um the metaphysical implications that

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.719
may be served along with it because if

01:21:36.719 --> 01:21:38.460
we do that we'll just have religious

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:43.500
wars again without a doubt because

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:46.320
um you know people will die for family

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.199
and Country and their god

01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:53.340
um and so understanding the power of

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.980
ritual understanding the power of the

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.580
imagination understanding

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.340
even the power of simulation and

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.780
creating

01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:04.560
um

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:08.159
liminal spaces that these are powerful

01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:09.739
and liberating

01:22:09.739 --> 01:22:13.679
experiences but not to reify them

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:15.020
metaphysical

01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:18.360
interpretation yes it's Poetics and

01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:22.440
lyrics it's not prose and explanatory

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.960
texts

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.500
um

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.840
and yes perfect Holly

01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.219
yeah I mean I was just like feeling into

01:22:32.219 --> 01:22:34.560
what you're saying is kind of radical

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.719
with this the simulation because it sort

01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:38.340
of implies and there's a lot more agency

01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:41.400
and maybe that we realize we have

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.380
in the game and so I was also wondering

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.540
if you could speak to the limitations

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:48.120
too like like you're talking we talk

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.860
about the stubbornness of reality like

01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.719
we're in this game and we have probably

01:22:51.719 --> 01:22:53.820
a lot more agency than we realize and

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.560
how to play it but then there's

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.960
obviously rules and boundaries

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.800
um

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:01.140
in that

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.020
yeah so that's an interesting question

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:07.080
it's like when you walk around and you

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.179
notice that most people are in a

01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:11.520
simulation

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.880
what advantage and I don't mean it in a

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:19.199
trivial way and even what what benefit

01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:22.860
how can I use that uh to be a benefit so

01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:24.719
it's what we talked about before it's a

01:23:24.719 --> 01:23:27.120
hard constraint most people are running

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.340
simulations

01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:31.500
um if I can avoid running a simulation

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.080
it's probably not possible I mean we

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.380
have to run some simulations just like

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:39.540
animals do but these kind of simulations

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:42.659
that get you if I can avoid that is it

01:23:42.659 --> 01:23:45.840
possible for me then to have agency

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.580
that's beneficial not only over myself

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:54.480
but over many of the diluted people

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.940
um that's an interesting question uh

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.540
there's different people

01:24:05.699 --> 01:24:08.340
you know if you saw the Atlantic article

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.340
with sorio floral at Maple

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:14.159
um this is basically his

01:24:14.159 --> 01:24:17.400
uh life's goal now is that people are

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.520
running simulations chat GPT large

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.640
language modules are going to take

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.679
advantage of people running simulations

01:24:25.679 --> 01:24:27.780
because they simulate people talking to

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.320
you and uh

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.040
and

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:35.219
um so if you can train people on large

01:24:35.219 --> 01:24:38.580
language modules and make them do good

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:40.440
things rather than

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.739
follow capitalist values uh maybe this

01:24:43.739 --> 01:24:46.320
is something we should do

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.380
um

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.800
not I don't really enjoy that level of

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.620
strategic strategy but

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.699
um

01:24:56.699 --> 01:24:58.739
a lot of this is being talked about it

01:24:58.739 --> 01:25:04.920
was just in a retreat that was quite odd

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.600
um

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.920
about uh creating new religions to save

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.140
the world uh

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.000
yeah

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.760
um there's a lot of this going on right

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.920
now I think it's fine that it goes on

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.580
it's just it's just not I mean a lot of

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.760
people are trying a lot of things to

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.719
mitigate the meta crisis

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.739
laughs

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.140
I find the the notion that we are

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:40.500
simulating things just it's fun I think

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.960
it's fun I mean I thought this is what

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.239
came to mind what do Consciousness have

01:25:45.239 --> 01:25:48.120
in mind why creating having us create

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.460
simulations why is that and the fun oh

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:52.800
that in mind is a simulation too I just

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.600
think that's funny I just think the

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.400
whole thing is fascinating and worth

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.760
playing with yeah

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.100
I want to add something um

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.760
the the idea that their simulation upon

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.380
simulation upon simulation and that

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.000
we're all doing it and what is there

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.980
without simulation and you mentioned the

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:14.940
void

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:17.639
and it seems like there's the there's

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:19.199
the track of the void and then there's

01:26:19.199 --> 01:26:21.179
the track of

01:26:21.179 --> 01:26:23.340
um participation a participatory

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:27.360
Universe a relational sort of in essence

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.659
that there is a relationality

01:26:30.659 --> 01:26:31.920
um

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.800
and um

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.760
that's and that's more of a

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.620
judeo-christian even though that gets

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:41.699
caught into you know a story about a uh

01:26:41.699 --> 01:26:43.679
all sorts of stories

01:26:43.679 --> 01:26:46.620
um that are limiting and maybe even

01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:49.679
manipulative but the idea that there's a

01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:52.620
relationality at the core

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.219
in life and and for me like the idea of

01:26:56.219 --> 01:26:59.219
the arousal when you said

01:26:59.219 --> 01:27:01.320
um you know we're stuck in the sensory

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:04.260
mode or arousal satisfaction Motif well

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.780
what if what if the censoring motor

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:08.639
explo

01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:10.020
um

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:13.560
experience of that is just an outplaying

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.580
of something prior which is an a basic

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:22.199
arousal but nature that has to do with

01:27:22.199 --> 01:27:23.880
um our relationality

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.840
and um and I do not have

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.520
metaphysical training to talk about that

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:35.480
except that for me the experience

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.100
of life as being

01:27:40.159 --> 01:27:42.719
participatory and

01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:46.739
um personal on some level

01:27:46.739 --> 01:27:49.460
uh

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.900
has

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.560
more mystery to it and more aliveness to

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:04.739
it than the idea that okay there's that

01:28:04.739 --> 01:28:07.139
and then that's a limited simulation and

01:28:07.139 --> 01:28:09.239
beyond that there's the void and I don't

01:28:09.239 --> 01:28:11.400
know so

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.920
I think this word mystery I think that

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.840
was close to what mushin was saying I

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.699
just feel really good it's unanswerable

01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:19.920
and that's the word we use for that

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.739
feeling like the void is a word that I

01:28:22.739 --> 01:28:25.380
use for like that doesn't feel good but

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.540
if you say beyond that it's just mystery

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:30.360
then then I get that kind of happiness

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.480
that Justin has like it's a mystery why

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.940
we simulate and it's like it's it's

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.980
fascinating

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:42.060
um uh but I think for for our project

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:47.460
here is to is to notice that

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.639
um we've already situated this capacity

01:28:50.639 --> 01:28:52.679
in the ant you know the sensory motor

01:28:52.679 --> 01:28:54.540
and it's consistent with the animals

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:57.600
although we don't animals don't seem to

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.580
uh simulate themselves uh which we do

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.820
um and uh

01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.040
just building this thread all the way

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.940
down into into the natural environment

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:14.040
uh is

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:14.820
um

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.340
is part of our project

01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.520
um that even these most sacred cows

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.580
about how we are separate

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.880
um are are not that you know they're

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.199
they're different and degree not

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:34.400
different and kind uh from from uh

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.500
from other beings that we know in the

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.900
world and

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:42.239
props beings that we will encounter in

01:29:42.239 --> 01:29:44.100
the future

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.900
so

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.300
um yeah

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.780
um these little exercises are not easy

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.000
for people to do

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.659
um I'm channeling I think uh

01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:00.440
uh

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.179
someone

01:30:03.179 --> 01:30:04.199
um

01:30:04.199 --> 01:30:06.480
you know it's not like you can go and

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:08.280
just have tea and crumpets with your

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.739
friends and ask them to meditate on

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:13.260
their breath and ask them

01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.540
how they can be aware of awareness you

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.400
know and

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.120
um

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.179
so just just it's you know this is

01:30:21.179 --> 01:30:23.219
meditation and action these little games

01:30:23.219 --> 01:30:26.699
are building a metacognitive skills and

01:30:26.699 --> 01:30:28.620
and different types of

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.780
subtle awareness with a lot of

01:30:30.780 --> 01:30:33.239
Distinction making and

01:30:33.239 --> 01:30:36.960
um yeah and it you know at this stage

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.120
when it seems somewhat easy to you don't

01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.340
don't forget how

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:44.280
how extraordinary actually this kind of

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.080
attention attention is

01:30:48.179 --> 01:30:51.239
and Liz's dog is no longer a puppy I

01:30:51.239 --> 01:30:52.940
noticed

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.219
how did that happen

01:30:55.219 --> 01:30:57.900
first I thought you had someone's your

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:01.280
friend's dog and I'm like no

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.139
any other comments before we go

01:31:06.139 --> 01:31:08.940
I guess I just want to offer into the

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.940
space based on Phoebe's share I'm doing

01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:13.560
um breaker for artists right now with

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:16.080
Rich Blundell and so coming into his

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.000
work about how if you go back to the

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.040
very origin of all things it's

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:23.280
relationship that's everything that that

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:26.820
exists comes out of relationship so

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.340
whether it's simulations in the space or

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.840
whatever if that's

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.880
Behavior yeah

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.159
yeah around you know a relationship

01:31:35.159 --> 01:31:37.820
arousal this

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:41.460
so they if you weren't aroused and and

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.920
uh how can you avoid relationships if

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.380
you are aroused so the energy in

01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.540
relationship

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.699
excellent I mean there's other things to

01:31:50.699 --> 01:31:53.760
talk about uh with this but I think we

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:57.060
did really good with the exercise and uh

01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:58.560
hopefully

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.500
some new insights will happen

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.340
um

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:05.760
for you this weekend thank you so much

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.460
thanks everyone fantastic

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:10.760
thank you thank



## Cohort 2

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.800
so what does the song Say

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.139
centini sentience of internal external

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.980
and virtual existence

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.920
um it's a pretty good description of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.920
uh what we're after

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980
of course it's a total techno

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.260
technophile uh you know

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.980
um

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.740
band and they're into transhumanism and

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.079
everything so maybe there is some

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.300
tension there but I kind of like the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540
song

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
okay uh let's start with how you so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.940
I never remember your actual name but

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.200
um

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
that was it yeah okay

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.500
so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.800
um are there any uh

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.680
questions or thoughts that have

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
percolated uh from the previous session

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
just a couple of you were on it uh that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.960
we might want to open the space with

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.979
um

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.360
before we get started

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.759
well I'll just say that it feels like in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.040
the breakouts and the exercises we were

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.180
doing and just in the content itself

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.900
that we're trying to come into contact

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.780
with something that's very slippery yeah

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.579
like trying to

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.020
pick up jello with with uh Chopsticks or

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.299
something yeah of course we're looking

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.240
at so we've gotten to be we're working

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.720
with very subtle phenomenon and you all

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.060
are getting really good at it I tried to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.520
reflect that back to you but it's very

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.319
very subtle phenomenon that we're

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.140
working with so

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.920
um

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.140
um just join the process this from first

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.180
personal experience

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.040
um I am going to start today with a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.080
little presentation

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140
um

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.620
uh just to frame some things and then

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.379
we'll do versions of the experience the

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.680
meditation that we did last time but yes

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.819
what we're after is very subtle and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.400
um as we noticed last time what just

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.680
happened oh well as we noticed last time

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160
what we're after might actually not

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.319
exist in the way we think it exists

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.920
right so we're all open to be surprised

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.819
just like when we did the memory

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.920
um module we were kind of surprised

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.819
about how memory was and wasn't

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:03.720
um

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.900
so um depending upon your background if

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.959
you're completely naive uh it may not be

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.060
a surprise what we're going to do if

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.680
you've how many of you have ever done

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.599
like awareness of awareness uh workshops

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.540
um depending upon

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.180
how rarefied

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.360
um they make the experience

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.159
um

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.819
will set up uh kind of a background for

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.980
your experience today but

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.080
um yeah it's very slippery

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.140
and it's one of those things like trying

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.920
to catch yourself in a dream because if

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.500
you look too hard you lose it and if you

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.379
don't concentrate enough you lose it and

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.420
so it's kind of we use the term

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.640
oscillation

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.159
um last time

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.680
I also use the term toggling but this

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.739
notion of slippery slippery

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.180
trying to catch something that's

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.659
slippery

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.799
um yeah so I'm just going to do a little

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.260
presentation to kind of set it up in a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.180
little different way

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.580
um and uh

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.280
well I have to do this first

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.040
if that's okay with you

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.160
um

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.780
oh because I'm not on that okay

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.940
all right so it's very hard to

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.460
um illustrate this stuff

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.120
uh

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.300
uh but I drew this picture by hand and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.800
then I reproduced God hide those I I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.080
drew this picture by hand and then I

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.900
tried to reproduce it here

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.259
what we what we're looking at here

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.259
um is

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.840
just a model so down here we have

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.220
completely automatic experience

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.340
um you know so a rabbit or a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.759
if you're in the Flow State

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.400
um just automatic experience without any

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.360
reflexive awareness no awareness of that

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.340
experience and certainly no awareness of

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.900
awareness so just automatic experience

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.720
then we we talked about reflexivity last

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.240
time it's in the course content as not

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.340
being after the fact we're not

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.620
reflecting on something after the fact

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.340
but we're aware in the moment of what's

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.740
going on so

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.680
uh dangerous situations if you can stay

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.440
present often are highly reflexive

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.660
because you're watching what the next

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.479
move or the person is but you're aware

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.460
of your own balance and what are the

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.860
tools and what do you have at hand maybe

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.900
there's a knife over there you're aware

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.300
of that right this is kind of a metaphor

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.460
for reflexive awareness you're in the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.060
present moment you're external sentience

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.860
is very uh online but also your internal

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.380
all of it's being processed in real time

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.600
so that's what we mean by reflexive

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.199
awareness it's not at all automatic

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.080
although

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.560
your final action might be might be

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.479
experienced as automatic but the

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.660
processing of all these things uh

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.460
happens at the same time you could think

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.319
of negotiators you know these movies

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.419
where people are negotiating with

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.520
violent criminals and there's a lot

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.080
going on but they're trying to be

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.300
present to the conversation and there's

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.360
a lot going on so I guess I'm over

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.180
dramatizing it but but this is this is

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.120
where you can really feel like you know

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.300
the need to be reflexively aware

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.139
um

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:02.100
comes online so reflexive awareness it's

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.800
not a meditative state in the sense that

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.139
you're not subtracting thought and

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:09.120
subtracting

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.860
um

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.340
perception you're you're trying to

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.340
widen your cognitive scope to include

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.199
everything in your experience everything

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.280
in

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.479
the external ex situation in the context

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.660
that you're in so that's what reflexive

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.979
awareness would be like

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:35.880
and then here we have a poll of

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.819
um experiencing things as subjective

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:41.580
States or experiencing things as

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.039
objective States

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.759
and this is the journey that I find most

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.380
people take I can animate it this way uh

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.000
so this is the journey that people take

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.740
uh so you

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.960
um in in meditative practices and

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.180
contemplative practices and that is at

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.020
first

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.539
I mean you know you might

00:08:06.539 --> 00:08:10.440
be quite automatic and in our culture we

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.940
start with

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.160
objective States things are what they

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.660
are the way I perceive things is

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.720
um is the truth of the matter or things

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.240
get to be black and white and then you

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.139
start to realize that there's a

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:29.699
subjective

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:31.979
content you become aware of the

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.320
subjective biases that you have does

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.300
this does this make sense

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.399
so you start to become aware of the

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.159
subjective biases you have and then

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.800
people spend a lot of time there and

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.060
then they end up then saying okay but

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.820
the systems themselves have biases so

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.920
then you see that the subjective virus

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.920
as an objective component and then you

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.260
see oh the fact that I see systems this

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.980
way is a kind of education I have

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.920
and then you start to see oh education

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.380
itself is an object and you start to see

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.920
education broadly conceived as a thing

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.399
and you become more objective about it

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:16.920
can you can you can you recognize some

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.560
of your own growth experience in this

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.120
right

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.820
so

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:27.060
then uh you get over here and you can

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:31.100
get to be like I would say Charles

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.140
eisenstein is kind of here like he used

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.440
to talk about a lot more about science

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.540
and really try to justify

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.720
his position with science and now he's

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.839
talking about the reality of aliens and

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.760
uh

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.940
um uh it's I'm not I'm just using this

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.920
as an example I don't know for sure but

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.000
you start to see people starting to have

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.800
really profound

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.680
um a long-term relationship with what's

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.839
actually happening is just subjective

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:05.700
phenomenon

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.160
um and people spend you know this is a

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.160
stage uh model it just seems to be the

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.080
way it is and people spend a lot of time

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.300
thinking we construct reality our

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.779
Consciousness is you know this is uh

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:22.080
conspiracy thinking on the internet once

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.060
people start to realize

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.519
go through this process and start to

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.320
realize the power of the subjective

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.380
component there's a lot of

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.580
a lot of uh

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.620
you become it's it's increasing

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.000
awareness

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.360
but it becomes trapped in this kind of

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.060
uh

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.360
um cave of subjectivity it can become

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.260
very unnerving uh so then you have the

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.600
transparency of the psyche comes into

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.060
here you go from emotional blending and

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.660
psychosis all I mean by that is like

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.640
conspiracy theories in this and who's

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.100
running the show and and then you get

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.100
the transparency of the psyche

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.300
um

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.399
and then if you do vipassana correctly

00:11:13.399 --> 00:11:16.980
you start to witness the phenomenon of

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.620
your mind and so has this objective

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.320
quality again like oh look I can just

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.120
see what's happening

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.459
and you have this What's called the

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:29.339
subject object move what was all the

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:32.399
subjectivity now you start to see oh all

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.680
this is just a simulation I've been

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.579
running

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:39.959
it's been driving me crazy like but it's

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:42.899
all thought and it's a simulation and I

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:46.440
can look at the embodied experience of

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.779
running a simulation in an objective

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:51.600
fashion so then you uh if you're lucky

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.360
you spend a lot of time in this

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.399
objective but you can get stuck in the

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.440
witness such that you're always just

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.920
witnessing what you perceive as

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.120
objective phenomenon

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:07.200
so this might not make sense to everyone

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.240
because you have to have done some of

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.880
these psychotechnologies

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.279
um but this is a uh uh pretty common

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:20.940
path and then eventually the self itself

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.279
becomes transparent so let's go of the

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:24.300
witness you have a little more

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.820
subjectivity and eventually you just get

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.700
to reflexive awareness which doesn't

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.360
oscillate so much

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.720
uh it's an ideal uh between subjective

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.720
and objective States

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.480
um it's just experience so this is a

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.920
um

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.000
kind of an outline of the path of going

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.339
from being automatic and basically

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:55.800
unconscious to

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.980
um a state of reflexive awareness

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.560
um but these these wild oscillations in

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.560
these periods of getting

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.940
um certainly getting stuck in

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.100
subjectivity just like the scientists

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.279
are stuck in the empirical fallacy and

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:14.579
objectivity uh people can get deeply

00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:18.180
stuck into uh

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.220
um subjectivity

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.360
um

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.260
along this along this route so are there

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.200
any questions is this um is this helpful

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.019
for anyone I mean you have to have done

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:34.500
some of these psycho psycho Technologies

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.120
um Holly and Kevin hi uh I was just

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.700
wondering how like Pure Imagination

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.120
Works in this model or if it is yeah

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.800
where Pure Imagination comes into play

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.459
yeah

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:58.320
of being imaginative you have is an

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.440
objective phenomenon

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.740
but if you're if you're like when

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.560
imagination becomes completely psychotic

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.420
and you can't tell the difference

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.639
then it's and it's become completely

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:13.100
subjectivity

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.639
then you're on the subjectivity part

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:21.779
um and uh um

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.180
yeah so you just see

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.899
people

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.820
it's a non-linear path and you see

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.120
um it's it seems to me that this is this

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.959
is

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.899
how people of our

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:42.420
times uh

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.720
they you you know of our our kind of

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.079
larger Community go through it

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:49.680
um

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.940
yeah

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.940
so you would think yeah so

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.060
um

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.060
as we did when we did the imagination we

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.399
noticed we could we could see ourselves

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:03.540
imagine

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.000
being imaginative and then we talked

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.380
about liminal uh experiences which you

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.480
lose the sense of authorship and you

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.279
start getting it becomes a pure

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.560
subjective experience

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.019
um so that's a state change

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:23.820
um that is interesting and useful but

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.339
it's these swings these oscillations

00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:28.800
that are probably inevitable then I'm

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.420
not trying to problematize it I'm just

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.079
trying to say that you can watch people

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:36.959
as a teacher you can watch people on

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:38.940
this on this journey and some people

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.060
just go from objective okay Sam Harris

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.320
he goes from object objective reality

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.160
to witness everything stays very subject

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.399
objective for him he's quite reflexively

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:54.420
aware

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.040
but it's always in the objective Corner

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.959
does that make sense to you

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:02.519
other people like I'm going to use

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:05.880
Charles eisenstein he's he's weirdly in

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.620
this I don't know like he's either

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.660
really right and I don't get it but it's

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:13.920
a little weirdly in in

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.079
the subjective

00:16:16.079 --> 00:16:18.899
fear or a reality

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.959
um and it's it's about trying to grow to

00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:25.440
the reflexive awareness and have it and

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.399
be interpenetrating or or balanced

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:31.860
um in the integral Theory days in that

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.139
Community a lot of people because they

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:35.940
were hyper intellectuals stuck in the

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.399
witness so they just saw all their

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:41.339
experiences objective States

00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:44.160
that they were separate from and it's

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.560
called the stink of Zen

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.160
um and so it's just a model to show that

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.839
there's a lot going on in the human

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:56.220
experience as we move from automatic to

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.759
um

00:16:56.759 --> 00:17:03.560
more reflexively aware uh uh States

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.360
and it all seems to be part of like the

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.260
journey the journey

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.520
um and I think people have

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.179
have basins of Attraction you know like

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:17.640
you can feel that I'm much I'm more

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.020
objective

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.540
than people who are highly imaginal and

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.400
doing a lot of liminal work

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.000
it's it's uh partially because I don't

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.460
know you know I I went through so many

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.059
years where I was 3 000 feet off out of

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:35.280
my body I was over here I was by

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.919
locating I was this I was that

00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:40.679
I spent a lot of time in the subjective

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:44.340
realm uh so

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:48.179
um I I see it as uh The Sweet Spot in

00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:50.400
the middle but I know in my communities

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.520
I I seem more objective uh than where

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.880
people are at right now

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.559
does that make sense is that helpful

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:04.340
yeah

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.539
and I had kind of a tangential question

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:09.000
just too about the the word is like the

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.780
difference if there's a difference

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.780
between reflective and reflective like

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.100
yeah so we've okay there's there's two

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.520
you know part of this

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.919
Christian's a stupid course part of this

00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:24.900
pop-up School is

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.380
using terms precisely so but they have

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.840
their we we Define them in our own way

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.020
so reflective has two two tone two uh

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.020
two meanings one is the common meaning

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.360
where like

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.700
we're a sports team and we go through

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.500
something and then we say okay why did

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.600
we lost let's reflect on that

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.480
so it's retrospective sense making of

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.880
something after the fact

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.640
then there's a spiritual meaning of

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.179
reflective and I wrote it in the course

00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:58.559
content

00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:02.240
um and that is that

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.860
um that the external world is a perfect

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.640
reflection of our internal state

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.640
that there's a one-to-one correspondence

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.380
you could say it's isomorphic to or

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.600
um a you know like a twin

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.660
so this is the spiritual meaning of

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.120
reflection you know that the Moon is

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.360
perfectly reflected in the water is a

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.480
metaphor they use for that the world is

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.900
perfectly reflected in consciousness

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.360
we're not going to talk about that today

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.260
we'll probably talk about it the last

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:43.980
um

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.039
the last session in this module because

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:50.220
we need to in order to understand that

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.480
we need to understand

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.960
awareness

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.500
um first because that that metaphor that

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.600
the world is a perfect reflection of our

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.600
internal still makes it seem like

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.340
there's two things

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.220
there's there's two mirrors there's one

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.960
well there's either the world and

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.460
there's a mirror or there's a mirror and

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.440
there's a world or there's two mirrors

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.840
looking at each other I don't know it's

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.620
very dualistic so it is true I I would

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.500
say but we have to learn how to

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.679
understand it and to give you a preview

00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:36.299
is once you are very reflexively aware

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:41.780
then you realize something very cool

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.280
and that is

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.740
you've learned so you go through this

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.780
whole journey understanding that your

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.640
psyche

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.980
in your dispositional state your

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.200
interior has a lot to do with how the

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.140
world comes at you it has a lot to do

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.460
with it

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.780
but this work is very hard

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:06.240
once you get to like the top there we

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.520
have reflexive awareness where it's it's

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.940
not so ice oscillating between the

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.960
subjective and the objective reality

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.120
um

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.660
you

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.600
and you notice how it works most people

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.760
as they get close to reflexive awareness

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.860
they're spending a lot of time in this

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.159
subjective State reality state

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:31.740
then something happens and you realize

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.360
that

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.679
that the oscillation is not necessary so

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:39.840
the dualism is not necessary and then

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.880
you realize that it's much easier

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.020
just to

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.260
work in the objective world because

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.140
we've evolved to manipulate objects

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.260
instead of having an object wondering

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.900
what my state is interpolating the state

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.659
doing all this cognitive work

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:03.299
since the real world so what happens is

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:05.700
you trust things like this my husband's

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:07.980
unhappy with me what can I do about it

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.440
I just try to make him happy with me

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.960
whatever I try to do I just try to do it

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.240
I don't get hung up on who's projecting

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.480
who or whatever I just tried to work in

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.539
the world until the physical reality is

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:24.840
solved because I know for a fact it's a

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.840
perfect reflection of my interior I

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.240
don't have to check my interior

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.080
and this is profoundly liberating

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.559
because we have evolved to to we're very

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:41.039
good at working with concrete things

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:43.620
but you see you start to see the

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.140
obstruction that the psychic move has

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.360
made because you haven't made things

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000
good with your husband because you've

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.820
been psychologizing everything first

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.320
so so

00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.880
if you get a sense of what I'm saying

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.460
you get completely liberated just to do

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.620
Concrete service in the world

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.100
and you you don't have to worry about

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.960
and you make and you try to make it

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.919
better and and it is it is transforming

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.360
your psyche you don't have to worry

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.820
about like your what's you just try to

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.740
do good things in the world now having

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.020
said this it's a pre-trans fallacy

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.520
there's a lot of people that try to do

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.080
good things in the world and they

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.480
haven't ever made that Journey so they

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.460
just project on the world and they

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.320
it up so

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.320
you can't start there you have to go

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.600
through this journey and then at the top

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.500
it becomes much more like single Loop

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:44.100
single Loop action Logics right I see I

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.100
see what I'm doing here is not working I

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.640
try something else I don't I just keep

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.860
being in service to what is versus

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.860
having to do so much

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.380
interior work let's say I trust that if

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.960
things aren't going well then I need to

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.780
change I keep changing and changing and

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.140
changing until things if I have love in

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.299
my heart and that's not expressed in my

00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:11.460
reality I just keep changing and

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.640
changing and changing until it does of

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.159
course again if you're not on the path

00:24:17.159 --> 00:24:19.679
this becomes horrible because then you

00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:21.780
know the hell is paved with good

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.679
intentions but at a certain point you

00:24:25.679 --> 00:24:27.900
start to trust

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.840
that the world is giving you proper

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.580
feedback

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.179
um and it's not and and you just use it

00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:38.700
as information so

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.900
um

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.080
so that's what that diagram is trying to

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.640
explain

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.539
um explain I know that was a lot but

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:50.340
um

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.740
and and and then you can you have little

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.780
instances I'm sure you've had these

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.640
experience where you just

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.260
instead of trying to like

00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:03.120
understand the complexity of the

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.280
Interiors of the other per you just say

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.020
you know I really missed you that's

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.179
really sad

00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:11.400
it'll be more complicated than that you

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.559
know it and

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.880
um

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.799
or

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:18.980
um

00:25:19.919 --> 00:25:23.520
yeah you you you your life becomes more

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.539
about

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:28.140
doing the simple right thing rather than

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.120
uh

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.880
the struggles you had

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.299
had so it's just I'm saying this is

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:38.220
because if you're at that stage just

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.059
give permission to uh simplifying in

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:44.900
that in that direction

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.679
does that make sense

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.200
and usually let me say this usually this

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.240
is in in current

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.880
uh situation this is something that

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.260
happens

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.880
to people in their 50s and 60s so it's

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.039
it's a long journey you know some people

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:07.140
are exceptions but it's a long journey

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.260
experiential Journey uh to go through

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.820
the the the the the the uh

00:26:15.299 --> 00:26:17.580
the structures of Consciousness that

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.380
emerged in the 60s 50s and 60s 70s and

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.140
80s and even with woke wokeness which is

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.700
a uh perversion of it are all subjective

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.740
it's all the emergence of subjective

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.299
awareness

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:35.460
um so this is kind of like as a society

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:37.919
this is the stage we're in and we're

00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:39.659
looking for this this other

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:42.659
transformation

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.760
you pray less

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.100
you feed people more this kind of thing

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.840
you know like that that kind of uh

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.860
it it's it's the the the

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.419
um

00:26:57.419 --> 00:26:59.580
Oxford diary you go back to the

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.320
marketplace and you're just you're just

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.620
a person now but it's not the same as

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.900
when you when you started

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.080
Matthew

00:27:15.059 --> 00:27:17.340
hello

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.840
how's it going it's been a while

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.080
um so

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:27.059
do you does a person need because I'm

00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:29.039
kind of

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:29.880
um

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.620
that Journey you just reminded me of

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.480
going from like objective to more

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.000
subjective

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.820
in order to kind of transcend this

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.500
subjective space

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.320
does a person need to

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.520
have a certain capacity

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.659
um for like

00:27:50.659 --> 00:27:53.159
metacognition because I I thought I

00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:54.659
remember you talking I don't know what

00:27:54.659 --> 00:27:57.000
that means but I remember you saying

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.559
something of the sort where

00:28:00.659 --> 00:28:02.400
um you were talking about people that

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.100
grow up in our culture get all these

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.580
sort of internal psychological

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.059
constructs like ifs Etc and it takes

00:28:12.059 --> 00:28:14.700
a certain amount of metacognition in

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.860
order to overcome all that stuff is that

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.419
kind of what you're talking about

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:20.760
yeah so

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.419
it shouldn't be trans

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.580
but but

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:29.640
metacognition is one way to do it

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.679
but if you're lucky something happens

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.659
like you get drafted and you have to go

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:36.140
kill people

00:28:36.539 --> 00:28:37.740
um

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.200
so sometimes people are thrown into

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.940
concrete reality

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.880
uh Saving Private Ryan you ever see that

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.020
movie

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.900
so here's someone Tom Hanks is in the

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.179
movie and he's he's narrating at his

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:55.140
experience is very highly metacognitive

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.960
but he's an extremely concrete situation

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.960
that has extreme constraints

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.559
and and this

00:29:04.559 --> 00:29:08.100
this is kind of you know uh generative

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.820
brutality so it doesn't require uh

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.740
metacognition

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.720
um and and

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.740
um

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.740
but

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.520
you wouldn't wish this other kind of

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.700
experience on people either probably

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.460
because the same experience could could

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.980
break you but a lot of times being

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.500
thrown into

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.380
extremely concrete situations

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.500
um

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.000
does the same thing

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
you can bypass a lot of a metacognitive

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.580
complexity

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.580
um

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:55.220
that that will also get get you there

00:29:57.779 --> 00:30:00.179
and I think that you know it makes sense

00:30:00.179 --> 00:30:03.500
that that can happen

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.980
I used to have this experience of like

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.260
oscillating between a focus that seemed

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.640
really clearly objective and really

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.220
clearly subjective and this like went on

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.779
for a long time and then eventually I

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:24.059
kind of lost track of it

00:30:24.059 --> 00:30:25.620
um I find it hard to think in those

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.360
terms anymore

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.039
um at some point I had like a real

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:30.299
familiarity with what like the witness

00:30:30.299 --> 00:30:31.919
state in the non-dual state were and I

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:34.620
also like ditto for those like I don't

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.880
know what that means anymore and I can't

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.380
like

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.880
it's strange because I can like use them

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.740
grammatically and talking but I don't

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.820
understand what they're supposed to be

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.440
anymore

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.460
um

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.039
as this has gone on I've noticed that

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:49.740
I have like less of a capacity for

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.039
metacognition so like your your upwards

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.779
the like Arc of development is in the

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:57.299
direction of more meta awareness

00:30:57.299 --> 00:30:59.460
um my experience has been like less

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.740
explicit meta awareness to the point

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.480
where like I can't really

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.399
evoke it or point at it happening

00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:07.440
organically I could like manually write

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.179
a journal or something

00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:11.640
but um I'm curious why you

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.320
yeah

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.419
so this is beautiful because this is

00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:18.260
exactly what I'm

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.980
see I don't put it as meta awareness I

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.779
say reflexive awareness because

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:27.120
reflexive awareness has a lot of embody

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.399
perceptual

00:31:29.399 --> 00:31:34.799
uh uh uh attuning Attunement to it

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:38.940
um and and if it's not subjective it's

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.059
not meta-aware in a subjective sense and

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:44.399
it's not the witness in objective sense

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.260
it's what I call I mean I don't know

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.000
what else to call it reflexive awareness

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.279
and that's exactly what happens this

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:54.000
oscillations stops and you still

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.140
understand it uh but something else is

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.640
going on

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.260
um and you have more Choice sometimes

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.080
you track a lot sometimes like why track

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.760
everything all the time you know like

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.899
it's not you know it's not important to

00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:10.799
um

00:32:10.799 --> 00:32:15.200
um and uh depending upon who you're in

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.580
conversation with if if they're highly

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.100
objectivist you will seem too subjective

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.740
if you're if they're highly subjective

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.960
you will seem like you went to the dark

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.480
side and started to be too conventional

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.720
and because both sides won't really uh

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.640
you know you'll seem like the other side

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.039
to either side

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:39.779
um so that's a marker of exactly

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:40.380
um

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.179
um

00:32:41.179 --> 00:32:44.419
what I've seen over many many years of

00:32:44.419 --> 00:32:47.279
teaching I didn't see it in myself

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:49.440
because it's very hard to say in

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.960
yourself I didn't look back and say oh

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.260
yeah that happened to me but mostly I I

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.440
saw in all those years of teaching

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.159
um and and uh it's easier to see

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:04.679
tracking tracking students over a long

00:33:04.679 --> 00:33:06.899
period of time

00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:08.940
um for me it was mostly like I lived in

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.980
Two Worlds I lived in the horse World

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.039
which was objective and cowboyish and

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:16.200
then I lived in philosophy and

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.019
metacognitive spaces so it wasn't like

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:21.299
uh embodied uh

00:33:21.299 --> 00:33:24.440
oscillation it was like this is two

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.000
realities I lived in

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.220
um but people who do

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:33.120
um more formal uh training

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.279
psychotechnologies

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:37.799
um that's kind of like the journey

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:41.700
they're they're on uh usually yeah

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.799
yeah this is uh

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:45.179
there's funny there's this like a

00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:46.440
possuma nerd that's like really

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.539
concerned that the like manual explicit

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:50.399
versions of things are somehow being

00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:52.140
replaced by just like more and more

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:54.960
absences of things yeah and it's a nice

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.399
sanity effect to say like oh yeah this

00:33:56.399 --> 00:33:57.840
is like a reasonable thing to have

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.519
happen

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:01.640
um

00:34:02.519 --> 00:34:04.200
I had another question that's gone now

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.600
oh um

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.580
and here's how this or if there's any

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.480
relationship to you once said that

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.919
I'm not sure if you literally said this

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:16.919
but like there was some some energy like

00:34:16.919 --> 00:34:18.720
all this intellectual is kind of

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:19.859
like work

00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:21.659
like using all these fancy terms and

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.700
being incredibly precise about conveying

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.280
stuff this is kind of like really

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.260
tedious and it is good to frame it as

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.820
like it's actually been really useful

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.440
for me to think of this as like a form

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.599
of work that I do yeah and how like not

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.639
the point like the work is in service of

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:36.720
something else and there is something

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.560
else

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.960
do you where do you feel like

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.639
like I didn't start with that kind of

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.280
like relationship to nerding out about

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.500
this stuff I'm curious where you started

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.580
and how you saw that shift

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:53.359
yeah so you know I'm I'm

00:34:53.359 --> 00:34:56.639
where the work is in

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:59.640
being precise with language not because

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.640
language is important but because we

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.500
want to all agree that when I use this

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.680
word I'm I'm feeling the same thing I

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.900
have well closest we can get to the same

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.520
experience

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.160
because only then can we begin to like

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.119
what you just said to talk about uh like

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:19.859
is this experience what you're having

00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:24.540
you know and and so so we're trying to

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.400
be precise with language and we have to

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.800
make up definitions for things because

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.400
in popular in regular culture these

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.400
words mean all kinds of things so

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.560
um I think that's a lot I think that's a

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.500
lot of work and then we agree to talk to

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.619
our each other this way and that is also

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:45.060
work

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.160
um so

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.420
um uh

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.660
I don't know I mean

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.180
so I beat up on people for having like

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.480
big abstract terms and this and that I

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.760
don't I try not to have big abstract

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.420
terms I try to have words that function

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.700
you know

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.099
um but it is a little

00:36:14.099 --> 00:36:16.560
tricky to

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.920
to

00:36:19.859 --> 00:36:23.339
yeah to trade in words and be kind of

00:36:23.339 --> 00:36:24.780
like

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.200
you know suspect of language so

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.260
um

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:33.540
but it is it is it is a certain kind of

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.160
work

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.200
um

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.140
but hopefully like Wendell Berry says at

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.760
the end of the day it's good work you

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.339
know like uh

00:36:44.339 --> 00:36:46.520
um

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:49.380
the purpose of the course is not

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.480
necessary unless you want to

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.280
teach

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.599
um is not necessarily to be able to

00:36:57.599 --> 00:37:01.260
be fluent in the precise use of the

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.520
words

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.579
um but to be able to

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:06.200
discern

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.960
and recognize experience you see this is

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.220
the thing I'm going to say this to you

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.900
because I know you're quite Advanced is

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.500
that I'm trying to replace phenomenology

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.140
with attending to experience and they're

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.359
different things

00:37:21.359 --> 00:37:23.040
and

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.079
um not that phenomenology is important

00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:28.200
but when you're doing phenomenology you

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.660
should always be able to like oh what is

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.560
the experience I'm having and and that

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.500
continually brings in the more human

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.960
aspect of it or the more relational

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.020
aspect of it so

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.460
um uh so I try to use words that then

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.740
are coupled to

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:53.280
uh experiences that we can discern so

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.440
it's it's both sometimes you use the

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.300
word and people

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.119
are having trouble attaching an

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:01.980
experience with it and sometimes it's

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.440
the other way around

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.520
um it's a it's a little messy but

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.579
um

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:14.099
but you know

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:16.980
it's where we're at right now so

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:17.700
um

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.859
it's not really a model I have a lot of

00:38:19.859 --> 00:38:22.440
models but I don't have a model I use

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.260
models to do exactly what we say because

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.260
models and heuristics uh work better

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:29.880
like that little thing I showed you it

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.640
works better than language right if I

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.380
had tried to say that in like an

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.079
abstract language and you get into these

00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:39.780
these spaces you sound like the guru you

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.760
start talking about like in the words

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.680
coming out of your mouth are like what

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.500
the am I saying that you know so I

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.260
try I have a lot of models but that's

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.420
that's what they're for

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.640
to to

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.260
make it simpler to understand than

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.359
trying to like talk about it

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.079
yes Liz did you waste your hands or or

00:39:07.079 --> 00:39:09.839
the others jolt I did but zolt's other

00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:12.000
partner also had a so you go first

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.740
because you're probably tying into it

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.480
salt whispering

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.700
that's actually different I guess

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.339
um

00:39:19.339 --> 00:39:21.599
oh I was just wondering if you could

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:23.700
talk more about

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:24.420
um

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.740
because you you mentioned that our

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.020
society tends to like bias towards the

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.940
objective side of things from a starting

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.260
point

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.619
um so when someone has gone deep into

00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:36.720
that chaotic

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.280
um subjective side of this oscillation

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:41.940
um

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:45.000
and it's kind of like poking back out on

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.619
the objective side

00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:49.520
um I guess I'm just curious

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:52.200
there's not really a question here I was

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.339
just wondering if you could talk more

00:39:53.339 --> 00:39:55.560
about that process like you mentioned

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.440
conspiracy theories I assume like

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.440
um like gripping on to narratives like

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.359
your subjective experience maybe

00:40:03.359 --> 00:40:04.980
bleeding out into your sensory

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.960
experiences things like that but could

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.640
you talk about that and also maybe just

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.260
like the process of like what it's like

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.280
when you're

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:14.339
kind of coming out yeah so at first you

00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:16.859
realize that

00:40:16.859 --> 00:40:19.920
quite early now in our society that

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.780
something about your subjective

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.400
orientation is making

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.079
there's two different interpretations is

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:30.839
making things happen the way they do

00:40:30.839 --> 00:40:35.940
or is projecting an interpretation on on

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:39.960
the world so you people realize that I

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.700
have the same problem with with

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.619
different women over and over and over

00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:45.180
again and it's because it's the problem

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.660
I have with my mom okay so this is I

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.599
call it cracking the code it's a really

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.060
beautiful

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:56.700
uh expansion of consciousness so but

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.680
then you start to get into this

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.359
territory where you think everything

00:41:00.359 --> 00:41:03.359
depends upon me

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:07.500
um controlling my interior

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.140
so you see some young uh meta modern

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.380
people are like this like like they

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.079
really and and then people go to

00:41:16.079 --> 00:41:18.180
monasteries and they do this and then

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.640
that and that's good but

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.079
if it doesn't resolve itself into

00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:28.560
um uh it can it can it can take on a

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.320
life of its own yeah so that you're in

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.540
this this

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:36.180
um and it's very code like source code

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.240
what is the source code and and

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.220
um uh so we're going to talk about

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.800
things people then they get into things

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.079
like I'm aware that I do this oh who's

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:48.359
aware of who does that oh who's aware

00:41:48.359 --> 00:41:50.280
who does that and you get into these

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.420
recursive awareness uh mental models

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.160
they're all simulations but you think

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.920
they're real there's all kinds of Halls

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.859
of mirror that people get when

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:04.020
um you know because it's amazing how

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.240
much progress you can make in the

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.359
subjective realm but then there's

00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:12.960
there's there's no balancing to it this

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.140
is why Zen monasteries uh

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.260
um the traditional ones balance you know

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.359
that with like work duties you have to

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:23.700
wash the floor and clean they put all

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.660
this kind of like mundane concrete work

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.740
in coupled to this because of this need

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.520
to balance science

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.280
you know you've got one one leg in the

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.260
subjective and one leg in the objective

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.060
world so

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.260
um

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.859
um and and so

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:48.060
um

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.240
you can you've if you've seen some of my

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.260
uh fun debates or playful arguments with

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.040
Apostle I I believe he's he's too much

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.660
in the you know everything is a

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:02.400
simulation you can't possibly have

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.500
direct perception everything is already

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.260
encoded in some kind of Illusion

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.240
everything is this everything is that

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.200
it's not properly balanced with

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.940
um

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.359
the concrete reel let's say

00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:20.460
um and

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.780
um

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.140
we we as a culture not even even outside

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.880
of like these spiritual communities

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.460
whereas a culture think everything is

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.940
constructed gender is constructed

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:35.579
um everything is up for grabs depending

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.980
upon your interpretation of it we live

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.260
in a simulation the simulation is

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.680
mentally and socially constructed

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.200
um so it's kind of like a phase as a

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.140
society we're in that's highly

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:54.800
uh subjective you know subjectivized uh

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.700
yeah

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.700
um

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.099
and then the systems

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:04.980
in our society also

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.040
um

00:44:07.319 --> 00:44:09.839
you know the media and stuff can make

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:12.300
money off of everything being like like

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:16.440
subjective and not not objective so

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.500
um

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:22.800
yeah

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.599
I don't know if I said enough but I

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:28.079
can't I'm I'm searching for

00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:29.460
um

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.420
some common examples

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.680
right like I think that's great I kind

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.740
of just wanted to hear you riff yeah on

00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:40.560
that yeah I was trying to search my

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.040
memory banks for examples but yeah

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.260
and the thing that like I'm going

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.900
through on this end is

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.300
um I'll have some insight which seems

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.520
pretty systematic because it applies to

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.040
most situations like say like the impact

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.319
of

00:44:58.319 --> 00:44:59.400
um

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.200
like the aspect of frustration or

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.060
something like that on on like the

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.619
social field or something like that and

00:45:04.619 --> 00:45:07.079
then I'll super salience it

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:08.460
um

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.160
and then it'll

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.040
it'll be so Salient that I'll wind up in

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.200
some kind of like feedback situation

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.000
where now I'm completely dysfunctional

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.760
yeah because I'm so at and then it'll

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.280
just like switch week like what's being

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.560
salienced and like I'm at a point now

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.060
where I think this is good because I'm

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.380
getting like the gist that I'm just like

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.060
processing things one at a time or

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.740
something but it's like it's pretty

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.440
unstable and I'm

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.200
yeah anyway that's the situation that I

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.460
was in that was kind of motivating the

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.520
question of like how do you like the

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.579
people you come out yeah so one of the

00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:46.640
things happens is

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.460
you you become an objective Observer of

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.880
your subjective state so this is you

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.579
know the subject's object move

00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:58.980
um you don't want this to be a permanent

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.000
thing but what happens is so different

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.980
moves like

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.740
you know like I have this thing I call

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.980
Bodies In Space right you put bodies in

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.060
space and body's distort space

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.980
and this is true whether there are dogs

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.220
or cats or horses or insect you know you

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:22.140
get in a car and you have one little

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.079
freaking mosquito in there and the space

00:46:25.079 --> 00:46:26.640
is distorted you can't have a

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.819
conversation whatever so

00:46:29.819 --> 00:46:32.940
this is very objective language yeah

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.940
it's very it's it's it's it's powerful

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.920
but it's kind of simple and then you say

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.160
how does your body distort space so you

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.400
turn the you turn the thought that like

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.980
and this is true my dispositional state

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.180
has causal effects effects on how people

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.920
act around me and then then I look at

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.079
the external environment and think why

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:00.000
are these people crazy because I've

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.800
discounted the fact that I'm making them

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.680
crazy so this is the middle range when

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.720
you start to realize something in me is

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.339
making them act like that and then I

00:47:08.339 --> 00:47:10.260
react to that but then you think well

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.180
something in them is making you know and

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.220
it gets very complicated

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.680
and then you start to use these other

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.200
frames that are more objective bodies to

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.819
sort space

00:47:20.819 --> 00:47:24.119
what kind of body do I want to be not

00:47:24.119 --> 00:47:25.579
what kind of

00:47:25.579 --> 00:47:29.700
personality and then I noticed that just

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.980
the way I carry my body

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.640
makes most up most of the difference

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.599
this makes it simpler to me much simpler

00:47:39.599 --> 00:47:42.720
and and all this psychological

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.460
complexity

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.400
it's still true but the psychological

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.680
complexity actually was reflecting

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.740
something about your body more than vice

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.260
versa and the body's easier if you can

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.319
trust it easier to work with at that

00:47:58.319 --> 00:47:59.280
level

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.339
now having said that sometimes you can't

00:48:02.339 --> 00:48:04.140
make your body do that because you're

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.599
actually psychologically con contracted

00:48:06.599 --> 00:48:09.960
so then there's a back and forth but a

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.240
lot of what this teaching is at the

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.760
pop-up school is to constantly

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.460
condense things into like you know how

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.099
do you want to sort space you know and

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:21.900
then you see yeah like this person just

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.640
walked in and this happened all of a

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.160
sudden I'm not I still notice things

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.740
that are completely relevant

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.380
but it's not so psychologically or

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.760
subjectively subjectively complex

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.839
and it has more power to transfer to

00:48:39.839 --> 00:48:42.839
um other aspects of the world like you

00:48:42.839 --> 00:48:45.839
know boardrooms and you know stuff like

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:48.839
that so

00:48:48.839 --> 00:48:50.040
um

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.980
so that's that's how how it works I mean

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.319
you can't you have to expose the

00:48:55.319 --> 00:48:56.940
subjectivity you have to correct the

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.079
code

00:48:58.079 --> 00:49:00.300
um but

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.680
this move toward like what uh your your

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.300
partner was talking about is the goal

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.480
and yes and some some communities don't

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.760
realize that

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.079
well thanks yeah

00:49:18.079 --> 00:49:20.240
thank you

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:24.140
and you know the other way it has been

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.660
uh resolved in the past is is being too

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.460
objective just being the witness then

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:31.079
you're not participating you're not

00:49:31.079 --> 00:49:33.900
engaged so that was that was more like

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.240
when I was growing up that was with all

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.819
the westerns and people were doing they

00:49:38.819 --> 00:49:41.160
were becoming

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.220
creating so much subject object move

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.980
that they were just witnessing like uh

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.319
Wilbur would says hurts more

00:49:49.319 --> 00:49:54.020
matters less you know it was kind of

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.880
I see I hurt more matters less this

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.060
whole witness think of Zen thing was was

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.859
the thing then

00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:05.060
and yeah

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.359
so

00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:15.079
I think it was Liz next

00:50:15.079 --> 00:50:18.260
thank you

00:50:20.819 --> 00:50:22.920
how's your time Bonnie like shall I

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.660
bring something new in right now or yeah

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.599
yeah we're good I I want to actually

00:50:27.599 --> 00:50:29.819
share an experience that happened about

00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:32.040
three or four weeks ago of reflexive

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.079
awareness I think pure reflective

00:50:34.079 --> 00:50:36.359
awareness and and just kind of what

00:50:36.359 --> 00:50:37.859
happened with it just for your

00:50:37.859 --> 00:50:40.859
reflection so I was walking with my dog

00:50:40.859 --> 00:50:43.680
in the forest and we popped out came in

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.140
down a steep hill we popped out of a

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.540
thick forested Place into a wide open

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.000
cut

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.520
and just as my dog popped out there was

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:57.540
bear walking down five feet and so my

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.460
dog basically jumped right in front of

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.500
the bear and

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.960
then the bear and the dog started having

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.500
a tussle and the bear was chasing my dog

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.180
but my dog was trying to get back to me

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.680
and figure out what is this thing had

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.900
never seen a bear before and so the bear

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.180
thought the dog was not getting the

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:19.020
message so it kept attacking my dog and

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.160
I jumped out onto the trail I had I had

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.740
probably about 20 seconds of

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.140
experiencing real terror like thinking

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.200
this is the end for my dog

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.839
and then I just went okay what do I I

00:51:33.839 --> 00:51:37.319
need my dog because the bear is between

00:51:37.319 --> 00:51:39.240
me and the dog so it can't come back to

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.680
me so I need to like create this

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.960
triangle by crossing over going into the

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:45.059
thing calling my dog so that it can come

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:47.579
in sideways and

00:51:47.579 --> 00:51:50.760
as I started to leave the trail the bear

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.680
and the dog are going down the trail

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.500
the my dog I think figured out this is

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.900
not good and started to run away and

00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:59.700
then the bear lost interest and started

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.640
coming back up the trail toward me but I

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.200
didn't care I wasn't scared at that

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.359
point I'm like I still have one job get

00:52:06.359 --> 00:52:09.420
my dog back so I went into the thing I

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.000
called my dog my dog did exactly the

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.160
right thing came up to me like in the

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.500
Triangle the bear kept walking up the

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.599
trail that's the end I'm not going to

00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:20.460
make it a longer story yeah that's

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:22.859
enough of the story to say

00:52:22.859 --> 00:52:25.079
after that incident

00:52:25.079 --> 00:52:29.220
when I came home the way that I

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.960
processed it was to draw what happened

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.819
awesome in these patterns of energy

00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:41.640
and it was so interesting because I

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.740
wasn't trying to figure out what

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.099
happened I was trying to complete

00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:50.700
what happened like that to have a high

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.819
flower of the energy of what happened

00:52:52.819 --> 00:52:55.140
and the only other thing I want to say

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:59.460
about it is I also was very clear I do

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.880
not want to tell this story of the day

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.040
my dog almost got killed by a bear

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.780
because that's not actually what

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.180
happened right at all

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.180
what happened is my dog and a bear and

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.760
me all came together everyone moved

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.460
truthfully for what was true for them in

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.160
the moment and in the end that's what

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.800
happened yeah end of story end of story

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.960
so I I would just love to hear you speak

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.880
in terms of this conversation we're

00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.579
having about what you see there yeah so

00:53:29.579 --> 00:53:32.160
it's perfect because reflexive awareness

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.800
is all about tracking multiple States at

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.540
the same time so you probably knew

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.119
exactly where your dog was and had a

00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:41.520
view of like what was in relation to

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.180
whatever you you were very aware active

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.460
but then you noticed oh I can't let my

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.559
mind get tear you know be in this

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:52.140
contraction so this is what reflective

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.740
awareness is is that it's like a reflex

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.839
I don't know why that term is used but

00:53:57.839 --> 00:54:00.960
it's it's about tracking

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.900
X interior is exterior zooming in

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.540
zooming out

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:10.500
flow goals uh you can't be so goal set

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.140
that you can't you know all these things

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.200
it's a fluidity and this this is

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.119
um yeah and and so and even as you tell

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:23.819
it like then I looked at my mind I was

00:54:23.819 --> 00:54:25.680
all these things aren't really that

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.980
chopped up so it's all it's all this

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.460
this this pattern of movement

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.579
um and so so uh

00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:38.220
yeah that's that's what we would call

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.500
reflexive awareness now the thing is

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.140
it's easy to describe reflexive

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.420
awareness in these kinds of situations

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.839
like I said in war and stuff like that

00:54:48.839 --> 00:54:50.880
the question is how do we bring this

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.640
online in everyday interactions like at

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.140
the boardroom

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.380
um we tend to be uh you know because the

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.319
bear makes us so animal-like and then we

00:55:01.319 --> 00:55:03.359
we can get into these stages where

00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:06.180
social interactions create anxiety and

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.040
we get contracted and we actually can't

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.319
do reflexive it sounds silly really

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:12.900
right like like you get into the Zone

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:13.980
when you're

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:17.579
dealing with a bear but with people

00:55:17.579 --> 00:55:20.400
um the the stakes are often create more

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.579
anxiety and so the question is how do we

00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:28.140
do this uh in everyday situations

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.040
um

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:34.380
um the the the it's more subtle so it's

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.540
it's harder like when the bear is here

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:38.819
or there or after my dog after me it's

00:55:38.819 --> 00:55:41.880
very obvious uh it's more subtle

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.119
tracking what's happening in the

00:55:44.119 --> 00:55:46.980
relational field with people are they

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.260
being aggressive or not or

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.940
like

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:54.660
um but yeah that's that's definitely

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.700
reflection reflexive awareness and not

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:58.260
all people can do that like some people

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.119
freeze or they freak out or they get

00:56:00.119 --> 00:56:02.760
tunnel vision or

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.480
um

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:06.240
yeah or

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.359
um

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:11.240
yeah

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.859
to add in to the story I was with a

00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:15.660
friend we only had one bear spray

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.160
because we said we only need one there's

00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.520
only two of us but when the bear I

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.520
jumped off the Steep Hill onto the track

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.140
thinking my friend was coming right

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.180
behind me with the bear spray and then

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.880
the bear Turned to come back to me and I

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.680
turned to look thinking she'll be right

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:34.440
there she was not there and I'm like

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.980
Maria bear spray and she was up on the

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:41.099
trail Frozen she was frozen and then

00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:43.440
like when I said bear spray she snapped

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.960
out of it and she ignited the bear spray

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.480
and came down onto the trail but she was

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.460
in an incident 10 years ago with two

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.440
friends who were running

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.000
a bear

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.880
encountered them and said let's climb a

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.859
tree the other two said no climbing

00:56:58.859 --> 00:57:01.020
trees the other one said yes I am she

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:03.480
climbed the tree the other two took off

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.099
to get help

00:57:05.099 --> 00:57:07.140
and when they came back the friend had

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.480
been knocked out of the tree broken neck

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.380
dead yeah do not try to out climb up

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:16.079
there if you've ever seen a bear climb a

00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:18.720
tree it's not a good move but the thing

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.839
is that she had that whole thing going

00:57:21.839 --> 00:57:23.180
on

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.800
it was impossible for her to be

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.859
reflexively aware she was locked in

00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:32.940
this you know a memory whatever yeah so

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.819
that's that's that's a perfect example

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:39.059
of of it well I'm wondering in the

00:57:39.059 --> 00:57:41.640
boardroom like in the boardroom how much

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.040
of what we're bringing past experience

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.760
that interferes with the capacity

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.520
like how do we do that move how do we

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.079
not have

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:55.079
other stuff

00:57:55.079 --> 00:57:58.740
um interject itself and kind of it's

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:00.059
almost like putting something all into

00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:02.040
the space so that you can't have the

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.980
clear reflexive awareness

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.619
like fear for me like I got an

00:58:07.619 --> 00:58:09.660
adrenaline whatever I have one job take

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.900
care of my dog so it was clear it was so

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.839
clear I have one thing I have to do but

00:58:15.839 --> 00:58:19.500
in the boardroom you have yeah so yeah

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.839
the the answer to your question is

00:58:21.839 --> 00:58:26.339
simple but not easy and that is you when

00:58:26.339 --> 00:58:28.740
you just said it you had one clear goal

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.880
and when we're in the boardroom we

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.800
um don't have clear goals

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.780
we want to keep our job we don't like

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.359
this but we want to keep our job and so

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:42.240
we're incoherent in our action

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.339
um this is something you learn with the

00:58:44.339 --> 00:58:46.200
horses you can't make them move if

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.299
you're if you're want them to move and

00:58:48.299 --> 00:58:49.859
you're afraid at the same time they just

00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.440
like they're you're invisible to them so

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:55.859
we we are we are incoherent our body and

00:58:55.859 --> 00:58:58.799
our intentions are incoherent so you

00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:02.640
can't uh get uh you you can it so it

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.260
doesn't work if you try now I'm gonna

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.500
stop

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.819
matte and the result

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.660
um I'm just trying to

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:20.880
I guess get a bit more

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.440
um clarity about this reflexive

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.480
awareness

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.559
um

00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:27.960
I don't want to you know beat it into

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.359
the ground but

00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:32.099
so

00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:34.440
let me use another example so at work

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.359
I'm a server and sometimes we can get

00:59:36.359 --> 00:59:38.460
pretty chaotic

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.380
um you know you have like whatever 10

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.119
tables one person wants this nobody

00:59:42.119 --> 00:59:44.160
wants that and you can going on in

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.319
the kitchen whatever

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:48.059
um

00:59:48.059 --> 00:59:51.240
in those situations

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:53.359
um

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:56.099
would you say that a reflexive awareness

00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:58.700
would be

00:59:58.799 --> 01:00:01.740
being able to deal with all that stuff

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.980
without being caught up

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.500
in like your own fear of oh man I'm

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.599
scared of saying this table

01:00:09.599 --> 01:00:11.339
because I forgot the order or something

01:00:11.339 --> 01:00:13.980
or I'm scared of like

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:15.720
um you know asking the kitchen for

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.859
something because I know they're already

01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:20.640
stressed or is it kind of like is it

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.099
almost Anonymous with like a flow state

01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:26.579
or I I don't know I'm just trying to

01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:28.680
I'm not so clear about what that is the

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.540
reflexive yeah it's a good question it's

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.520
not a flow State because in a flow State

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.940
it's more it's actually quite automatic

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:39.119
yeah um and so you can get only get into

01:00:39.119 --> 01:00:43.200
flow States when your skill levels quite

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.880
match to the task right so reflexive

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.200
awareness requires you to

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.119
track

01:00:54.119 --> 01:00:56.640
consciously track

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.319
um

01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:01.440
subjective and objective reality at the

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.819
same time

01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:05.339
um so the the perfect example is a

01:01:05.339 --> 01:01:07.920
negotiator like your tone of voice and

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.660
whether you're going to give something

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.980
away and and you know you have to use

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.140
you have to be conscious of your

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.299
subjective State as

01:01:18.299 --> 01:01:23.420
a a skillful means whereas in in sports

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.640
uh flow States a lot of music and sports

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.059
and the subject it's much more objective

01:01:30.059 --> 01:01:31.920
skill

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.520
um and a lot of times you notice there's

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.140
a ritual where you control your

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.000
subjective state so you're not afraid

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.859
and then you let the Flow State happen

01:01:40.859 --> 01:01:43.440
but these are situations where you have

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.760
to

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.260
um you have to be involved let's say or

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.900
track your internal States unless it's

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:53.640
so low stakes or you're so good at it

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.119
you don't have to anymore you know

01:01:57.119 --> 01:01:58.500
um so

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.960
so uh

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.920
um but I would say that

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:09.180
um what you're describing is so we're

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.980
talking about

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.260
um you know you're probably the stage

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.780
where there's still an oscillation but

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.760
you're probably spending too much time

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.400
in the subjective reality except like oh

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.980
they waited two you know they waited one

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.280
point you know they waited literally 80

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.339
80 Seconds for that that's all and so

01:02:29.339 --> 01:02:31.740
that's an objective like the more

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.619
objective markers are what's going on

01:02:34.619 --> 01:02:35.940
um versus

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.060
um

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.380
[Music]

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.780
um tracking so much the subject of the

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:43.160
subjective aspect of it

01:02:43.579 --> 01:02:47.880
or like when my first horse was having a

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.799
baby I'd never seen any animal have a

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:53.819
baby and I had read up about it and I I

01:02:53.819 --> 01:02:55.680
put a

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:01.020
I put a a clock in the stall because I

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.240
knew that the baby had to come out of

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.700
the sack within like three minutes and I

01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.119
knew I would have no idea how long three

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.819
minutes was because I would be too

01:03:11.819 --> 01:03:16.280
subjectively involved so this is the way

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.900
this is the oscillation that happens

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.680
it's just it's just what happens

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.700
I remember I think I

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.740
yeah I think one thing that you said

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.559
that's really has helped me in the past

01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:33.619
with this kind of issue is like

01:03:33.619 --> 01:03:37.440
uh what was it something about

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.599
don't assume you know what's going on

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:40.680
with them

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.900
as sort of a first step towards them

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:46.260
exactly and that like the other day I

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.180
remember I had to ask the head chef a

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.780
question and he's a you know

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.059
you know

01:03:53.059 --> 01:03:55.680
chefsterfully but so basically you know

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.299
whatever and I know it was already

01:03:57.299 --> 01:04:00.119
stressful environment and whatever and I

01:04:00.119 --> 01:04:01.740
just did that

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.319
I could feel my Sensations the fear in

01:04:04.319 --> 01:04:06.720
my in my body but I remember also just

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.640
looking at his eyes and asking him and

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.780
like

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.760
doing that kind of thing it almost felt

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.099
almost like a suppression almost as well

01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:16.859
but I don't know or controlling but yeah

01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:19.140
yeah I mean you have to do what you can

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.599
do you have to do you know one time

01:04:21.599 --> 01:04:24.660
there was a big brouhaha in my office

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.720
because we had this guy Eric he was a

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:30.180
wonderful guy he'd been he'd been an

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.099
employee of that place forever when it

01:04:32.099 --> 01:04:35.400
was a very small but he was also

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.119
um

01:04:36.119 --> 01:04:39.599
he was also I would say cognitively

01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:42.900
disabled and as the company got more and

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.000
more fancy we did more and more fancy

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.760
things and he had a period where he was

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.280
playing around with drugs and he got a

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.520
woman pregnant he had a trouble he had a

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.359
troubled life and people were like well

01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:59.040
we have to get rid of Eric and other

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.420
people were like we can't get rid of

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:03.540
Eric you know he's been here forever

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.940
um where else he's gonna go blah blah

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.380
blah and it was this big fight and

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.839
finally I just said you know this

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.819
company is not going to go bankrupt

01:05:11.819 --> 01:05:14.040
because you keep Eric

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.799
on the payroll like it was just

01:05:16.799 --> 01:05:19.520
ridiculous to have this whole

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.799
psychological profiling of his life and

01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:25.079
what was he going to do we didn't keep

01:05:25.079 --> 01:05:28.380
him and loyalty when the truth is the

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.079
stakes were not even worth talking about

01:05:31.079 --> 01:05:33.900
like just the objective truth was and

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:37.020
then it was settled and and it was like

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.359
no one felt like they won or lost right

01:05:39.359 --> 01:05:41.940
so like the power of the objective

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.940
perspective is is really

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:47.880
um is really lost in our society and the

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.339
thing is he stayed for another 18 months

01:05:50.339 --> 01:05:52.260
and then the state hired him and he had

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.780
medical care for life and other stuff

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.720
like like the whole universe opened up

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.119
and we didn't even have to have them on

01:06:00.119 --> 01:06:03.660
on as an employee anymore but so there's

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:06.299
so many times where like there's this

01:06:06.299 --> 01:06:08.579
brouhaha

01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:11.339
and the objective reality is quite

01:06:11.339 --> 01:06:13.980
simple and clear but you can't get to it

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:17.099
and and so something like something like

01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:18.720
that

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.520
um

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.059
but it's not easy you know because we

01:06:24.059 --> 01:06:27.000
are we're Who We Are

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.960
uh so

01:06:31.859 --> 01:06:34.380
the Katie question

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.140
um goal number two noise

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.420
um

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:41.700
I this question was from a while ago oh

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.380
it was about goals you were talking

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.539
about if you don't have Clarity in your

01:06:45.539 --> 01:06:47.640
goal in a situation there can be a lot

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.619
of anxiety

01:06:49.619 --> 01:06:51.180
um

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:52.440
I might have been answering my own

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.599
question as I thought about it but um I

01:06:54.599 --> 01:06:56.940
like I often have the opposite issue

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.400
like if I'm going out

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.319
um and I have some like a diffuse kind

01:07:01.319 --> 01:07:02.579
of far away goal that I don't really

01:07:02.579 --> 01:07:04.799
care if it happens today or not

01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:06.960
um and I'm going out like into a city to

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.280
try to make that happen say I don't know

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.079
the way of the land or whatever

01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:13.260
I'm just like openly attuned to the

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.299
coolest so I'm gonna find all of it

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.920
and have an amazing day and somehow

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.099
weave my way to this end point but if I

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:21.180
have

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.260
I guess maybe this is the difference

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.660
between goals and plans

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.760
um like if I have a

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.180
too much of a plan then there's like

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.220
constant friction with the plan every

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.480
step yeah like just anxiety constantly

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.099
um so I'm wondering like how do you

01:07:38.099 --> 01:07:39.780
think about goals and plans and anxiety

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.000
versus yeah it's actually a perfect

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.720
distinction strong goals open plans

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:48.780
right so so

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.180
um and and that's what like Thomas

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.640
bjorkman would say you have a North star

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.720
you have your goal yes and that steers

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.839
you to through and in and out the

01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:02.400
non-linear

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.539
um Journey uh that takes you there

01:08:06.539 --> 01:08:08.880
um and so

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.720
um

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.180
so even like you're saying I I visit a

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:15.240
new city and I I find cool places that's

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.160
a pretty clear goal

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.319
I want to find cool places without a

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:21.359
plan that's a pretty clear goal and

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:23.699
you'll notice it it steers your

01:08:23.699 --> 01:08:26.339
decisions right so

01:08:26.339 --> 01:08:27.130
um

01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:27.179
[Music]

01:08:27.179 --> 01:08:28.859
um

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:30.719
if it was the first time you have went

01:08:30.719 --> 01:08:33.839
to a city and your goal was that

01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:35.819
but you're used to planning and you're

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:38.520
nervous then you'd have incoherent goals

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.339
right you kind of want that but

01:08:41.339 --> 01:08:43.020
you start planning because you're

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.319
nervous when you get there and so the

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:49.140
the goals doesn't mean their goals

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.120
aren't both good they're just you're

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.000
you're you're incoherent you know you're

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.819
some of this and some of that and

01:08:56.819 --> 01:08:59.339
cool yeah

01:08:59.339 --> 01:09:01.940
thank you

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:14.339
would it necessarily always be

01:09:14.339 --> 01:09:16.739
great to always just have one goal

01:09:16.739 --> 01:09:17.940
though like

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.560
to me that seems like a really tough

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.620
thing to do for me anyway like no just

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:24.060
it's just

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.500
I mean in many cases

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.540
you know you don't really have

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:33.000
goals you're just you're just

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.100
going with the flow or something because

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.560
it's an experience and it's it's you

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.540
know I mean you might there are some

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.960
goals like some some Rewards or benefits

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.179
to doing what you're doing but if you're

01:09:45.179 --> 01:09:48.239
going to uh in our scenario be you know

01:09:48.239 --> 01:09:50.580
you're in a risky situation and you want

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:51.960
to stake

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.480
put a stake in the ground

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.460
um you better be sure you have clear

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.560
goals or else

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.660
you're not going to be coherent in your

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:06.000
actions so if if Liz wanted to save her

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.060
dog and she was terribly afraid of

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.920
herself at the same time her action

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.780
would be incoherent and it wouldn't have

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.699
flowed the same way she would have been

01:10:14.699 --> 01:10:16.080
like a little bit of this and a little

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.940
bit of that and a little bit of this and

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.320
a little bit of that

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.600
um but she had a very clear goal and so

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.320
her actions were were coherent

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.340
um and Powerful

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:30.719
yeah I just wanted to say about that it

01:10:30.719 --> 01:10:32.760
was really interesting because I wasn't

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.620
swayed

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:37.739
from my goal by the bear coming toward

01:10:37.739 --> 01:10:41.940
me like at all I didn't it it wasn't it

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:44.219
wasn't what was most relevant well the

01:10:44.219 --> 01:10:46.380
situation changed and you responded to

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:48.719
it but you didn't change your goal yes

01:10:48.719 --> 01:10:51.000
so you didn't say my goal is to save my

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.920
dog and when the bear stands in front of

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.320
you you keep going straight that's not

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.900
what happened but throughout all the

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.600
movements it was the same goal that

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.300
creates coherent action and it's very

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.120
powerful it's powerful for the bear

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.179
um if if you're working with a stallion

01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:11.699
you have a goal and then you start to

01:11:11.699 --> 01:11:13.860
renegani that's when you get you get

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.020
more hurt because you're inconsistent

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.320
incoherent and

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.159
um yeah

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.679
but it feels like kind of like where you

01:11:28.679 --> 01:11:30.860
went with us last call

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.179
having like

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:37.199
being able to come into a level of

01:11:37.199 --> 01:11:40.020
awareness that you're not holding on to

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.060
anything

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:46.100
because as the next thing is emerging

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.280
you're letting go of the simulation that

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.260
you might have had a moment ago about

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.600
like you're not carrying the simulation

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.540
with you into the new moment yeah so

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.940
that's the perfect definition of a

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:02.880
reflexive awareness it's in the moment

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.580
you're not trying to take little

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.460
pictures and reflect on what was that

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.739
you know you're not oscillating between

01:12:10.739 --> 01:12:12.840
little pictures of the past and then

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:15.360
little plans and then you insert them in

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.560
the moment

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.560
reflexive awareness is in the moment now

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.320
if you reflect as you did on your

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.960
experience beautifully

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.900
um you will notice

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.179
that there you know this lack of

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.820
oscillation and more like the flow that

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.159
that that you but like in the boardroom

01:12:35.159 --> 01:12:37.679
we get all we get all goal-oriented and

01:12:37.679 --> 01:12:39.060
we're on there and then the little thing

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.800
goes on well

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.719
you feel ashamed because people are

01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:44.580
staring at you you know now all of a

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.440
sudden you're out of reflexive awareness

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.199
you're stuck into oh I mean the story of

01:12:49.199 --> 01:12:53.159
you know shame or something like that

01:12:53.159 --> 01:12:55.980
um yeah so that you don't you're not you

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.440
don't oscillate you don't you can't

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.860
freeze in one mode or the other you're

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.320
just reflexive awareness is in the

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.940
moment

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.920
but it's not like a flow State I mean it

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.080
can have some feeling of Flow State but

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.900
as you report it you're tracking so much

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.840
and in in real flow you don't track so

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.860
much

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.739
at the same time I mean you

01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:21.179
yeah

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:23.420
well and I want to say that that that

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.400
very strong

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.239
almost an intuition to not

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.719
solidify this into a story of this is

01:13:33.719 --> 01:13:37.020
what happened it felt like if I if I

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.780
that and then it's a simulation then

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.500
what happened is the simulation I I had

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.320
the strongest to just let it be porous

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.920
and let it be keep becoming whatever

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.780
whatever it is I want it to be whatever

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.120
story you know whatever memory whatever

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.940
experience it is

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.980
the next time I think of it as whatever

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.739
emerges in that moment right not what I

01:14:01.739 --> 01:14:04.260
have made it to be that I now carry with

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:05.640
me yeah

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.920
you didn't take a selfie well it's just

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.340
happening

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.420
okay let's get on to the next slide this

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.780
was good

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:24.920
they have very clear goals

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.840
all right the next slide let's see what

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.120
you make out of this I only have two

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.480
slides

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.620
okay

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.000
um

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.179
so and this this reason why we're moving

01:14:42.179 --> 01:14:45.060
on to it is because something of that

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.940
Liz just said is

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:50.040
kind of rolling over into it okay so we

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.440
have that we have this slide come on

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.860
come on come on come on you can do it

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:59.580
you can do it okay so

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:02.520
now I'm trying I'm just going oh did I

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.739
put is the recording on this can I even

01:15:04.739 --> 01:15:08.699
see if the recordings on recordings okay

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:10.560
so

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.420
um now we're going to try to bring home

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:18.120
this this non-dual

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.760
uh

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.000
understanding of awareness

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.940
and see that in a sense all sentient

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:34.020
beings are no different than us

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:36.480
um and I mean that's kind of a simple

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.659
way to put it but I I'm giving you the

01:15:39.659 --> 01:15:41.040
conclusion at the beginning because it's

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.640
quite quite hard to explain and this

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.739
isn't the best presentation of it and so

01:15:48.739 --> 01:15:51.960
what so for example

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.360
this has to do with what we're playing

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.000
around with last time in the course

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.060
content like I'm aware that I see a

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.920
garden pretend to pretend you're in this

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.960
Garden at first you're just looking and

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.000
then you're like aware that you're

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.460
seeing this beautiful garden right

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:12.420
so you're aware of the the experience

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.640
that you're experiencing Beauty it's not

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.340
as naive as just looking at the looking

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:20.060
at this metal

01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.980
then I could do something trippy and be

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:26.460
like oh what's aware of

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.980
what's aware of being aware of this

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.140
metal and then I could say what's aware

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:33.060
of being aware

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:36.780
being aware of this metal okay so this

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:39.060
this is the phenomenon we're going to

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.420
look at it do do people really have

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:47.280
more complex experiences than uh than

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.260
direct experience so I'm just looking at

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.239
this meta and then I'm aware that I'm

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.800
looking at it I'm aware I'm sitting

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.520
there it's a nice day I'm looking at it

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.640
um and then something happens

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.340
that then so now I'm aware that I'm

01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:07.219
looking at a meta a metal metal

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:10.860
so the question is is this a different

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.860
kind of experience than just looking at

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.199
the meadow is being aware that you're

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:18.679
looking at the metal metal

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:22.679
somehow more

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:26.219
a higher or meta more meta to just

01:17:26.219 --> 01:17:29.820
looking at the metal is there more

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.880
distance between you and the object of

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.980
awareness here than here

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.380
so here the object of awareness is just

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.140
the meadow here the object of awareness

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.880
is that I'm aware of the meta

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.179
and then of course now I can be aware

01:17:50.179 --> 01:17:52.980
that I'm aware of the meadow

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.360
and

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.480
I can be aware that I'm aware that I'm

01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.880
aware of the metal

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.780
and then what I want you to understand

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.780
is that

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.840
the structure of the thought is getting

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.739
more complex

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.860
but the structure of the experience is

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.340
the same

01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:24.000
so this thought that has different

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.780
levels is still just

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.600
I'm just aware of this thought the

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.400
thought itself the structure of the

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:34.440
thought itself has gotten more complex

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:37.860
but I'm simply aware of it

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:41.820
there's never more

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:44.760
little selves being aware of something

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.159
there's never an infinite series of

01:18:47.159 --> 01:18:49.560
Consciousness the structure of the

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.420
thought that I'm aware of is more

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.580
complex but the structure of the

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:56.840
experience is the same

01:18:57.239 --> 01:18:59.820
as being in the meadow where now I'm

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.580
just aware of the meta now I'm just

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.920
aware of this thought that I've made

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.440
more complex

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.360
and so

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.260
it's it's it's this there's no there's

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:17.640
no it's all just awareness all simple

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.920
sensory motor awareness

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.659
it's just

01:19:21.659 --> 01:19:24.840
being a you know I'm aware that my hands

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.980
are moving

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:29.580
I'm aware that I'm seeing the meadow

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:33.360
and this structure and it doesn't matter

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.420
how complex the thought is it's not

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.719
further removed it's just one level of

01:19:39.719 --> 01:19:43.380
awareness so the structure of the

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.500
thought is has gotten more complex

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.659
but the structure of the experience is

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:51.179
the same you're just aware of it

01:19:51.179 --> 01:19:53.640
does that make sense

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.520
there's many varieties of this

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.380
um

01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:59.580
that you know that are so subtle

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.320
sometimes you don't recognize them as

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:04.199
the same trap but this is the same trap

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:08.340
and this is very important in in terms

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.320
of uh

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.380
um

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:16.040
understanding a lot of traps in in

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:19.739
post-modern and complex thoughts

01:20:19.739 --> 01:20:21.000
um

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.060
so uh

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.199
um

01:20:25.199 --> 01:20:27.600
whatever for whatever it's worth I don't

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.460
know if anybody has any comment on that

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:33.719
but but uh

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.580
it's very important to

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:42.540
gain to that stance of awareness that is

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:44.960
just

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:48.179
intimate with what you're aware of

01:20:48.179 --> 01:20:51.239
and then you can notice that it's you

01:20:51.239 --> 01:20:53.159
it's usually thoughts that are getting

01:20:53.159 --> 01:20:54.659
very complex

01:20:54.659 --> 01:20:58.140
but not be driven as if you you're drawn

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:01.260
into like you're inside Hall of Mirrors

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.420
and there's so much complexity because

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:06.360
once you're once you think okay that was

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.520
me then and now it's me and and you have

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.140
you're positing all these different

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.880
selves that are all in these different

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.340
layers of complexity you can't operate

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.860
on the thing that you're aware of you're

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:18.900
in the simulation

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.520
and so this is kind of a high

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.020
metacognitive teaching

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.580
um but

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:30.000
um it's something you might remember if

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.280
you ever get

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.860
um it's it's a lot of

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.199
um if you go back and read my after

01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:40.260
before Socrates it's a lot of what is

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.980
wrong with what John dravaki is doing is

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.940
if there's all these different levels

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:50.820
that the self is inhabiting these are

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:53.460
just more complex thoughts that the self

01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.040
is aware of it's it's not like there's

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.300
little homunculus that are moving

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:02.940
moving into different realities

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.739
um so this the reason why this is

01:22:04.739 --> 01:22:06.719
important is because of our project of

01:22:06.719 --> 01:22:09.840
putting the Mind back into the body

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.719
um awareness of these complex thoughts

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:16.940
is very similar to simple purse

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.440
perceptual awareness in the sense that

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.940
it's not

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:23.760
infinitely removed

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.880
um

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.040
yeah it's not infinitely removed it

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:31.320
problematizes Keegan's subject object

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.380
move uh because the subject object move

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.520
is happening in the thought experiment

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.420
not in the uh relationship between you

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:46.820
and what you're aware of itself

01:22:48.199 --> 01:22:51.120
so that may be interesting to some

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.360
people

01:22:56.219 --> 01:22:58.500
does that make sense

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.659
yeah it reminds me of a conversation I

01:23:00.659 --> 01:23:02.580
had a little while back and someone was

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.040
saying you know um I meditate while I'm

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.300
on my bike

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.800
and I was like why don't you just ride

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.260
your bike you know like

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:12.840
you know just ride the bike so I don't

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.980
know if that's kind of what you're

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:16.320
you're pointing to something something

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.580
like

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.260
uh

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.239
depends what they

01:23:21.239 --> 01:23:23.580
what they meant but

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.860
or they could say I find riding my bike

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.800
very very meditative or contemplate or

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.480
something like that

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.640
um but it's a distancing you know it's

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.699
it's a subtle distance in between

01:23:35.699 --> 01:23:38.280
it it it distanced the embodied

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.860
experience from the mind that wants to

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.159
simulate it and look at it or or

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:47.460
um and again mental stimulation is great

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.199
I mean we're mentally stimulating now

01:23:49.199 --> 01:23:50.940
that we're together with each other and

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:53.520
stuff like that but the awareness of

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.040
that uh that it's a simulation makes it

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.320
obvious that it's optional and obvious

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.199
uh you know you have a lot a lot more

01:24:01.199 --> 01:24:02.100
choice

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.159
but it just it's it's just you know

01:24:05.159 --> 01:24:07.140
Wilbur I could hear Wilbur saying how

01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:10.199
flat land you know my

01:24:10.199 --> 01:24:12.600
I just live in Flatlands

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.739
um

01:24:13.739 --> 01:24:18.179
so uh I get it but this is

01:24:18.179 --> 01:24:20.219
um

01:24:20.219 --> 01:24:22.739
what I've gone to come to believe

01:24:22.739 --> 01:24:25.500
right it's like a flat land it's

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.659
completely flat land this is not the

01:24:27.659 --> 01:24:31.380
kind of world I'm trying to uh trying to

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.420
articulate it's actually very rich but

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.699
from a certain perspective it can feel

01:24:35.699 --> 01:24:38.900
very flat flat landish

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:42.840
it feels like what you're what what I

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.659
feel when you are sharing this is like

01:24:45.659 --> 01:24:47.460
when you showed the pictures of the Mind

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.719
thinking about the Mind thinking about

01:24:48.719 --> 01:24:51.960
the experience of the garden versus the

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.040
garden

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.659
it's like

01:24:54.659 --> 01:24:58.560
it's all right there already like what

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.340
are we trying to add to like and the

01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:05.940
adding is actually taking us out of the

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.440
direct

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.020
experience you can be in relationship

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:11.940
with your mind the same way you're in

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.620
relationship with the garden you could

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:16.020
just see it working

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:21.120
and now so now but but then if you say

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.159
well if I can see my mind working then

01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:24.600
what's what's

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:26.280
and I'm aware of that you don't want to

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.659
get into this

01:25:27.659 --> 01:25:31.580
this complete infinite regression of

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.159
patterns of of thought and so to see

01:25:35.159 --> 01:25:37.140
your mind working is a beautiful thing

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:40.500
can be like as beautiful as a garden

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:43.380
um it could be ugly too you know

01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:47.040
um but to to be aware

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.440
you know reflexively aware

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.080
of uh just like you you were for

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.420
flexibly aware of maybe you gotten too

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:56.820
nervous you can be reflexively aware of

01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:59.940
oh look at this thing that my mind is

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.280
doing with this awareness oh I look it's

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.440
composing of home isn't that interesting

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.060
you know now

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.280
that sounds like a lot of distance but

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.880
but you can appreciate it from from that

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.800
awareness also but there's only one

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.199
level of awareness there's never there

01:26:16.199 --> 01:26:19.620
that everything else is the object that

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.300
you're aware of you're letting

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:23.940
complexify and you're just aware of a

01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:27.139
more complex object

01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:31.139
um yeah

01:26:31.139 --> 01:26:33.239
some people are smelling I think more I

01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:36.239
think this was maybe meaningful to Marie

01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:38.760
maybe not it's just goes against

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.760
integral Theory so here

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.219
I got off on integral Theory it's kind

01:26:44.219 --> 01:26:46.400
of

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:52.260
when you say like

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:54.300
you know you're you're looking at the

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:56.580
Garden then you're aware of yourself

01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:00.139
looking at a garden Etc

01:27:02.159 --> 01:27:05.480
to me that's like

01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:09.239
that sounds like an exercise in

01:27:09.239 --> 01:27:11.639
like adding

01:27:11.639 --> 01:27:14.520
complexity like and I don't know if the

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.239
being aware

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:20.600
of looking at the Garden

01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:23.400
is like do you mean it as like it's a

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.080
thought in your head like oh I'm aware

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.360
like or is it more of like

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:29.880
uh more of experiential awareness of

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.960
like

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.280
it's not necessarily thought in your

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.620
head but you're just oh you're aware

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.739
your your awareness has grown to

01:27:37.739 --> 01:27:39.480
realize you are looking at the Garden

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:44.659
well then that's the question isn't it

01:27:49.739 --> 01:27:52.080
are there two things happening are you

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:54.000
looking at the Garden and seeing the

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.239
garden

01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.820
and then being aware of it or are you

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:01.139
looking at the Garden and seeing the

01:28:01.139 --> 01:28:04.560
garden and then suddenly imputing a

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:07.080
simulation that you're looking at which

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.120
is called I'm aware of looking at the

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.340
Garden that's what it seems like to me

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.699
yeah so this is the 60 million dollar

01:28:14.699 --> 01:28:16.260
question

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.699
because it feels like I'm doing

01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:19.139
something

01:28:19.139 --> 01:28:20.580
yeah I don't know

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.860
but you know

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.840
the thought experiment I set up is

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:29.540
pretty simplistic but the experiences

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:33.380
are are

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.460
you know the question is is every time

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.560
you're aware of something in your

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.120
consciousness

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.480
is is every time you are aware of

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.100
something in your Consciousness actually

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:51.480
a simulation that you're looking at

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.000
is it is or is

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.500
is does awareness this is the slippery

01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:01.320
slope we played with or as awareness

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:04.620
and the perceptual experience the same

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.920
thing

01:29:11.219 --> 01:29:13.380
seems like we should just not teach like

01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.540
all these stuff and just have people

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.840
like because it just seems like we can't

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.699
complexify things too much I don't know

01:29:20.699 --> 01:29:25.920
wow this is a this is an esoteric module

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.120
um

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.520
but you know some people are doing or

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:31.320
this is a big part of like what people

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.300
exploring in these psycho Technologies

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.560
like whenever I noticed like because I

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.780
stopped meditating for like months now

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.760
and I notice

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.400
whenever I start to meditate

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.480
feels more off

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:55.139
yeah I ruin everything yeah

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:58.199
um well these are interesting questions

01:29:58.199 --> 01:30:00.120
um

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.239
um

01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:08.219
yeah they're interesting questions now

01:30:08.219 --> 01:30:10.860
jenlyn would say that

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.120
um there's en one that's when the body

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:17.520
and the environment are the same and so

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.980
you would perceive and you would

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.860
function but you would not be aware of

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:25.020
proceeding and functioning

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.900
that's what he would say is Ground Zero

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:29.520
he calls it one because he calls

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.980
something else Ground Zero which is

01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:34.679
highly problematic to me but it's very

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:37.520
confusing so so

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.960
you know

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.580
um

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.800
that's what he would say that that at

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.800
the bottom the environment in the body

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.340
are the same and then awareness is a

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.239
slight oscillation it's a slight

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:56.699
imputation is this it's a thought

01:30:56.699 --> 01:30:59.760
a thought that gets

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.020
subtly displaces the original experience

01:31:03.020 --> 01:31:06.840
now all of this is what I call Buddhist

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.159
Scholastics

01:31:08.159 --> 01:31:10.800
um it's it's

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.159
probably more dependent upon language

01:31:14.159 --> 01:31:16.260
and mental models than what you can

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:21.540
resolve from a meditative experience

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:22.080
um

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.260
it depends how you slice the concepts I

01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:28.260
think but he would say that

01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:32.159
yeah that awareness is

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:34.340
um

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000
is the second order you know he says the

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.300
body carries forward into images and

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.080
it's a second order so it's in N3

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.880
it's just still something the body does

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.940
but it's it's it's something else than

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:54.540
just uh direct perception

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:56.820
and then it gets complexified after that

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:01.040
and these these kind of occursions

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.080
um Kevin I want to call you David so

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.920
badly Kevin David

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.080
hi Bonnie I have a question about like

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:14.540
Free Will and awareness oh

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:16.320
um because I

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.840
so I think you know Sam Harris his whole

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.219
thing here's the whole thing where he's

01:32:20.219 --> 01:32:21.960
like oh yeah like

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.120
you can think or you can make a choice

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.340
but you can't or like you can have a

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.420
thought you can't choose what to think

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.340
about and if if you're kind of

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.320
meditating and you're

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.480
aware of thoughts that come up you can't

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:36.719
really control like and I I've had them

01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:38.520
noticed my own kind of fluctuation in

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:41.699
Life or like my own I guess subjective

01:32:41.699 --> 01:32:43.320
experience whereas like

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.800
sometimes it feels like oh like I I

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.300
don't really have control of what I

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.980
think of or what I do so it's kind of

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:52.199
more LED things up to the source or

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:54.900
whatever but then other times I feel

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.840
like I'm more in control like the

01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.420
choices and the thoughts and emotions

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:02.760
that I'm wondering how that kind of

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.260
like

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.960
the the like the Free Will of like what

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.139
I'm choosing to think or do relates to

01:33:10.139 --> 01:33:11.520
your like

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:14.219
your axis of subjective versus objective

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:16.620
and how it relates to awareness if that

01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:17.520
makes sense

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:20.880
yeah it's a it's a question and I have

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:22.860
to it so

01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:25.860
um okay so when I noticed that my

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:28.280
thoughts

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:31.260
that I am not thinking my thoughts but I

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.780
can notice them percolating up and there

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.880
they come and I actually can get this

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:37.920
sense so here comes a thought and I can

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.920
breathe through it so it doesn't come uh

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.900
well then did I control it or not but

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:45.540
anyways so you can start to witness that

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.880
these thoughts they're self-generated

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.000
and they come from like nowhere impulses

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.920
thoughts they wake up in the morning

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:55.139
they don't make myself wake up in the

01:33:55.139 --> 01:33:59.460
morning I I process insulin

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:01.860
um so now you see the eye I process

01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:05.040
insulin and I don't choose to process

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.699
insulin my pancreas does that for me so

01:34:08.699 --> 01:34:12.179
that's not me but at the at the level of

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:14.820
working with people who are full free

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.980
choice

01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:20.100
so one of the problems here is when

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.020
you're doing that meditation and you see

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:24.600
that thoughts and intentions seem to

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.260
arise naturally or be composed

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:28.880
um

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.420
they're

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:35.940
um not composed by your eye me mine so

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.860
much as they're composed by your

01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:39.780
unconscious let's say or your bodily

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:41.159
processes

01:34:41.159 --> 01:34:43.560
now the problem with Sam Harris is then

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.679
he thinks that the body obeys Newtonian

01:34:46.679 --> 01:34:49.260
laws of determinism hence you don't have

01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:51.120
free will

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:54.840
so I would say no I composed my thoughts

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.420
because I am this whole body environment

01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:02.040
thing and it doesn't obey Newtonian

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.760
determinism its participatory complex

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.679
self-organizing thing

01:35:06.679 --> 01:35:10.320
that that whose causal properties don't

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.480
even fall into the question of free will

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.219
or not free will

01:35:14.219 --> 01:35:16.460
because the question

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:19.460
requires you to buy into Newtonian

01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:22.679
determinism all right so if I say I make

01:35:22.679 --> 01:35:24.719
my own thoughts and I free will that

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:27.500
means I must be able to impose

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:32.340
causal effects on the world so I have to

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:34.320
say that the world is deterministic

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.620
what's the sense of having free will and

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:40.620
I have I freely move this pen but if the

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:43.739
pen wasn't deterministic

01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:47.639
I couldn't move it anyways so this is

01:35:47.639 --> 01:35:51.300
his problem yeah yes the thoughts are

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.360
don't come into my from my I mean my

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.540
structure the I me mind structure

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.400
doesn't even come from itself it comes

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.340
from the body's interaction with the

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:03.320
world

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.320
but that's

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.000
he believes that then we're talking

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.580
about Newtonian determinism

01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:14.940
the X hits Y and this cell bumps into

01:36:14.940 --> 01:36:17.040
that cell and this molecule is

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.719
completely determined hence we don't

01:36:18.719 --> 01:36:21.480
have free will and we know from the new

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:24.600
Sciences of ecology and the complexity

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:26.340
that that's not how the complex World

01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:30.360
works it's it's it's Auto poetic it's

01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:33.120
open it's unknown it's unprecedented

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.659
there are Novelties that are not are not

01:36:36.659 --> 01:36:40.219
dependent upon initial States

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.840
but then you get into this creepy thing

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.699
well if that's the case then how can I

01:36:44.699 --> 01:36:47.400
will anything and and it just goes

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.139
around and around because you can only

01:36:49.139 --> 01:36:51.900
ask the question from this notion of

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:54.120
linear cause and effect

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:57.600
um so it's kind of just a a a question

01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.580
that's framed

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.440
to fail

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:03.179
um

01:37:03.179 --> 01:37:05.639
so uh

01:37:05.639 --> 01:37:07.080
um

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:12.540
I I I say something like I mean

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.980
yeah

01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:17.340
if you look at free will

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.679
um it's a funny thing because we don't

01:37:19.679 --> 01:37:22.020
really have all the information when we

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:24.480
act and we don't

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:27.480
we can't possibly know the eventual

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:30.000
outcomes of our action

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.100
um and so

01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:32.699
um

01:37:32.699 --> 01:37:36.600
we Act without sufficient knowledge

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.139
and reacting to the unknown but I say

01:37:40.139 --> 01:37:42.000
that

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.639
um the kind of subjectivity we have the

01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:48.420
kinds of subject or person we are are

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:49.760
um

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:52.320
predisposes us to act in some ways and

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.679
not others and that we have

01:37:55.679 --> 01:38:00.120
um some we have quite a lot of uh

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.199
freedom to shape that subjectivity not

01:38:04.199 --> 01:38:06.060
exclusively

01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:07.800
um because we get condition our

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.960
subjectivity gets conditioned but once

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.940
you can see that your subjectivity is

01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:14.520
conditioned

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:17.159
it seems like you can intentionally

01:38:17.159 --> 01:38:18.600
shape it

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.080
that you have some agency in there and

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.520
then what arises spontaneously

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:29.520
um is different because you've shaped

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.880
the subject the subjectivity you are

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.120
uh so

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:38.520
um yeah these kind of questions are hard

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:43.380
to not sound like Google but

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.840
um I I say that the

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:49.199
um limiting Quantum of freedom is in the

01:38:49.199 --> 01:38:51.600
subject to subject interaction that you

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.060
actually only have choice between you

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.980
and the thing you're relating to in

01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:58.620
every given moment so this is the only

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.360
agency you have

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:02.460
and it makes all the difference in the

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.540
world

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:06.960
right so in every moment how I act in

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.300
this subject to subject relationship is

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.120
the only way I can exercise agency but

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.560
it makes all the difference in the world

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:23.070
Anna Maslow vanderplunk

01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:24.239
[Music]

01:39:24.239 --> 01:39:27.060
hello bunny hello everyone

01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:29.100
thank you for saying my name out loud

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:33.380
that felt really cool actually

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.360
um I'm curious about also about almost

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.179
the path of the will or the way it

01:39:39.179 --> 01:39:40.560
almost feels like the way of the

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.840
willingness it's not a will but it's a

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.020
willingness I feel in that sense and

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:48.300
when I'm thinking of the garden I'm in

01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.380
the garden

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:53.340
in relationship and how can I be more in

01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.800
relationship with what is is like this

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.780
business quality

01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:00.239
to this particular moment that will

01:40:00.239 --> 01:40:02.040
never be the same again

01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:07.280
and in this willingness am I willing

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.659
how am I going to say this

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.699
how am I going to stay present to what

01:40:17.699 --> 01:40:20.219
is in this moment without

01:40:20.219 --> 01:40:22.860
thinking or reflecting what I'm seeing

01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:25.320
now or what I saw now or what I will see

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.840
or what I can be in relationship with is

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:30.260
like this deep knowing or this intuition

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.480
that when something arises an action

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.179
that wants to be satisfied in a way can

01:40:36.179 --> 01:40:39.719
I act to it straight away and how is

01:40:39.719 --> 01:40:43.199
that moving into this new space is there

01:40:43.199 --> 01:40:45.960
more relationship more space more more

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.199
of it and therefore

01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:52.380
it becomes more simple it's less complex

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:54.120
and it becomes really simple because

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:56.040
it's always this business

01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.760
and I'm curious about this is

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:02.100
and I don't know I will never know but

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:04.139
I'm just following it it's like a

01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:06.120
following it's a track that already is

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:09.900
there in me and it's out there therefore

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.880
is that making any sense yeah I would

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.580
say that's a clear goal you say what if

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.920
I just do you know what if I set this as

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.040
a goal that I just try

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.780
and you know however you want to

01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:23.520
language it but you you have a very

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.760
clear sense of I'm just going to

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.280
do more in this relationship improve

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.560
this inflation increase in the sense of

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:33.480
Tyson younger part of this relationship

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:37.320
and and and what if I act

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.440
with awareness of that whatever

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:42.179
relationship

01:41:42.179 --> 01:41:45.480
and then you notice that it builds on it

01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.900
so it builds it brings something into

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:51.659
reveal that isn't there

01:41:51.659 --> 01:41:55.380
um and so a lot of times sorry that

01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:56.880
it's Fourth of July and they have like

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:01.400
cannons coming out in my neighborhood

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:04.520
so so

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.040
and so then what you're describing in

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.619
kind of a micro

01:42:09.619 --> 01:42:12.420
microcosm is the same kinds of fluidity

01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:15.239
that Liz was describing in this larger

01:42:15.239 --> 01:42:19.320
kind of threatening scene is do you see

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.800
this list you feel the same kind of like

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:26.159
action she's taking in this in this

01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:27.199
micro

01:42:27.199 --> 01:42:32.639
micro space and time uh is kind of very

01:42:32.639 --> 01:42:34.380
similar

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:36.440
um

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:39.239
I just want to say too it had the

01:42:39.239 --> 01:42:43.139
quality of it is like an acute awareness

01:42:43.139 --> 01:42:46.560
but not an awareness of being aware yes

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.360
it's reflexive it's reflexivity yeah

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.880
it doesn't it didn't go into that second

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:56.760
kind of simulation it's it's it's it's

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.380
it's it's

01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:00.900
like having Keen senses but one of the

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:02.900
senses is

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:04.460
tracking

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:09.540
your embodied experience in relation to

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.699
what is or something

01:43:11.699 --> 01:43:14.040
I don't know how to say it any well it's

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.340
wild because it felt like I could hold

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:19.380
so much complexity but the complexity

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:21.900
didn't feel complex it felt okay exactly

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.360
so this is what saw you at the maple

01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:27.900
Academy said he said the sage wisdom is

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.699
being able to hold and navigate

01:43:29.699 --> 01:43:31.940
complexity without

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:34.800
complexifiguration your mind

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:37.139
you know your mind doesn't get more

01:43:37.139 --> 01:43:39.119
complex your thoughts don't get more

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:41.520
complex your interpretations don't get

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.239
more com he so use the serum without

01:43:44.239 --> 01:43:46.800
complexifigurating everything

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:51.000
and so this is exactly

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.400
um the difference between that and

01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:55.320
developmental psychology where a lot of

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.380
the higher stages complex a figure

01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:01.159
ate everything using his

01:44:01.159 --> 01:44:04.560
term that he he made up

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:10.159
um but exactly so this is this is

01:44:14.340 --> 01:44:16.500
it's being in

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:20.760
the living you know complexity of you

01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:22.619
know Annie NASA nature is the most

01:44:22.619 --> 01:44:25.500
complex thing in the world complex thing

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.320
ever but when you walk in nature

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.199
it feels elegant so then he says that's

01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:34.440
true complexity there's an Elegance to

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:37.679
it when you're coherent with what is as

01:44:37.679 --> 01:44:40.139
Anna said your coherent was with what is

01:44:40.139 --> 01:44:42.739
which means you're you're

01:44:42.739 --> 01:44:46.679
enacting complexity of the life force of

01:44:46.679 --> 01:44:48.480
your own life force

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.219
but it's different than the complexity

01:44:50.219 --> 01:44:52.800
that cybernetics talks about

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.260
I want it that word is so powerful

01:44:55.260 --> 01:44:58.020
Elegance because it's naming something I

01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.780
didn't have the word but my sense after

01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:02.159
that was

01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:05.219
everybody was doing what was truthful

01:45:05.219 --> 01:45:08.400
for them to do my dog the bear my friend

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:12.540
Frozen me like everybody was just doing

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:14.760
what was the most truthful thing in the

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:18.179
moment to do and it was elegant

01:45:18.179 --> 01:45:21.119
so everything is is pinging back on

01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:22.800
everything else because you were in a

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.719
state of reflexive awareness

01:45:24.719 --> 01:45:27.960
you it's also a truth state

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.239
see without being in a state of

01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:31.980
reflexive awareness you would never say

01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:34.020
things like something like everyone was

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:36.060
being true to himself you would say the

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:40.020
bear was attacking me so all these all

01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:43.800
these ways of living are reflecting back

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.320
it's the same experience to see feel

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.020
it's elegant to feel that it's a truth

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:51.960
state to feel that it's it's

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:54.780
everything you said is all the same

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:56.760
thing right they all come together as a

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:58.619
package

01:45:58.619 --> 01:46:00.239
um yeah

01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:04.760
um Diana fascia calls it the truth state

01:46:05.159 --> 01:46:08.060
wow

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:14.460
okay we put yourself to sleep that's

01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.880
cool

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:22.219
so since relaxation exercise

01:46:23.639 --> 01:46:25.980
any last comments this I mean I know we

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:27.540
talked a lot but I think it's a great

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.460
recording and

01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:31.080
um and

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.960
um we'll probably do more exercises next

01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:37.440
time to see if we can

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:39.360
uh

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:40.739
yeah

01:46:40.739 --> 01:46:43.020
I don't know what the what how to end

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.619
that sentence

01:46:48.119 --> 01:46:50.699
still waiting for the playlist

01:46:50.699 --> 01:46:53.000
huh I'm still waiting for the playlist

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.860
oh

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:59.040
uh that one was I don't know it was uh I

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.219
found it oh okay yeah

01:47:02.219 --> 01:47:03.900
um

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:06.619
Consciousness anema and Chris

01:47:06.619 --> 01:47:09.840
avant-garde yeah

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.340
let me get on

01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:13.800
look at my friends

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.699
stay reflexively aware and Beware of the

01:47:17.699 --> 01:47:19.199
bear

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.500
foreign



## Cohort 3

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
foreign

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.480
so today I was driving to the grocery

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.460
store thinking about this class

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.840
and I was doing something that I don't

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.600
recommend but

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.660
I said I I ended up stopping at a stop

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.780
sign and I'd said okay I'm seeing this

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.320
stop sign

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.780
and then you know I tried to think of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.420
playing a little game and then I'm aware

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.980
of seeing this stop sign

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.340
and then I would relax and just see the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.559
stop sign and then it was like it was

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.199
like these waves and I was aware that I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.320
was seeing the stop sign

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.380
and I was trying to figure out this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.100
riddle right like what's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
foreign

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.299
thinking of that you're aware and you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.759
realize you're kind of

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.240
in a mental simulation

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.820
uh

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.400
so I think it's it's a fun practice and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.840
we're going to start by doing this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.979
practice

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.640
um in your work in breakout groups and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520
and you'll just agree to talk when you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.439
talk and then

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.079
be quiet and practice again and see if

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.320
you can get more familiar with it and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.439
and then debrief a little and you know

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.939
kind of like

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.259
use your own Rhythm for uh

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.399
um

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.579
it's like research right if we're

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.619
looking at something in a Petri dish I

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.479
might we're both looking at I'm like oh

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.160
well did you see that and then we have

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.040
to look closer and keep going back and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.440
forth between going and and seeing

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.840
or someone could be talking you could do

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.060
it with talking you know like I'm

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.640
hearing them and I'm aware of hearing

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.879
them

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.819
yeah it's and like Liz said there's

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.819
something very slippery you can you can

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.500
definitely feel when they're two

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.140
different oscillations and then

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.140
they get close but they still seem to be

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.500
sliding uh we kind of want to figure out

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.680
what's going on here

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.519
um and then we'll talk about

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.019
um

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.260
you know certainly why is it important

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.680
um or what meeting we can make out of it

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.739
um

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.580
are there any Reflections or questions

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.879
like last time we we worked mostly on

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.340
reflexive awareness

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.400
um so we're going back to this this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.060
um

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.379
meditation kind of research uh today but

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.599
we can then

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.200
um broaden it again so I hope you up for

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.599
this little experiment

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.340
um

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.879
does anybody have any questions about

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.440
what you're going to be doing

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.480
if I could just clarify what I think

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.040
we're going to be doing

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.180
we're going to be

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.099
trying to tune into

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.680
when is it pure awareness when is it a

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.040
simulation of awareness like when is it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.780
one when is it the other

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.599
and then occasionally if we're noticing

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.939
something we're just saying it into the

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.380
space and then we're dropping back into

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.139
yeah and it might be a good conversation

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.239
and then you'll notice

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.580
will want to go back in and check again

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.199
especially if somebody said something

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.020
and you could go back and check to see I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.699
suggest

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.220
you don't have to do it this way but I

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.080
found it powerful to do it when I was

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.020
staring at the light I suggest

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.100
um looking at one thing

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.320
and like okay I'm looking at it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.759
and and

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.100
notice the oscillation as soon as I'm

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.759
I'm aware that I'm looking at it

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.919
but

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.400
yeah just just you know we're just doing

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.280
the classroom just noticing these

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.900
these

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900
um

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.220
like sometimes when I'm looking at

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.280
something and I'm doing this exercise I

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.060
notice that a nanosecond went by and I

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.240
was actually not aware of looking at it

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.919
that's another thing I noticed that

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.539
there was

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.699
a point at which

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.500
if I'm just true to the perception and

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.320
then I act and then I asked I noticed

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.840
that there was a gap there was a time

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.419
when I was still looking at it but I

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.580
wasn't aware that I was looking at it

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.979
and so then I asked myself what is added

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.500
or removed

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.039
when I'm aware that I'm looking at it or

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.620
is being aware that you're looking at

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.780
something always behind

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.600
maybe when I'm aware I'm looking at

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.340
something I'm actually in a simulation

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.280
I'm just aware of the thought that I was

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.620
looking at it

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.060
hmm

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.620
so

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.600
um if you if you choose one thing

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.039
and you try to just look at it don't

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.960
attend quiet your mind

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.880
yeah

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.319
there there might there should be an

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.840
oscillation and then you could jump back

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.479
out and start the other way I'm looking

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.400
at it and I'm aware that I'm looking at

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.240
it

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.620
and then try to

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.319
make the aware I'm looking at it less of

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.479
a thought and see if you can meld it

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.479
into the perception itself

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.819
so

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:51.419
um

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.500
yes David

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.919
uh I just want to let that sink in for a

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.780
minute then I have a comment and a

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.020
question

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.419
uh the comment is that the last time I

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.620
did this in session one

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.520
afterwards I was on a walk and I fought

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.960
that what we were doing was Collective

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.180
Insight practice

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.580
and I hear your instruction about

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.500
the posture we're going to take

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.960
personally

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.220
I want to know more about

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.919
the purpose of

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:46.560
speaking to

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.740
our experience with the other people in

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.300
our Breakout

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.020
okay that's a collective Insight yeah so

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.960
it's basically doing research

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.500
together

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.080
and

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.660
notice things are going to come up

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.919
see if you did this in regular Monastery

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:12.479
you would do it in the Zen month then

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:14.280
would tell you what you're looking what

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.039
you're doing

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:18.840
they keep fashioning what you're doing

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.560
until you agreed that

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.500
that was what was happening to you

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.080
so we're not doing that we're saying

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.120
we're going to practice this we're

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.880
trying to answer a question

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.800
um and we're going to try to have

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.959
insight into what's going on by doing it

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:37.820
together

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.580
but uh instead of having a conceptual

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.979
question that we're working with we

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.540
actually have

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.019
the question you know so

00:08:49.019 --> 00:08:51.720
um so it's it's we're collectively

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.420
trying to understand this research

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.700
question

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.480
um some people may already have what the

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.459
guru told them some people may have read

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.620
all these different things

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.800
um that could be part of it too but in

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.740
this practice we

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.779
um we trust

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.820
the experience

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.980
itself

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.940
um and uh so we're not really trying to

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.100
get consensus

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.240
um I think that will have some common

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.640
Reflections

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.540
um

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.940
and we're not trying to really

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.500
then get on a conversational uh sharing

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.839
thing we always we always want to when

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:41.760
we're debrief will come in and talk talk

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.580
talk but we always want

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.720
hmm she said that let me try again

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.880
uh

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.459
you know which one of these stayed very

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.660
close to the experience

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.980
like we did with memory and we got

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.839
really good at like oh well this has

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:03.000
really happened with me except this is

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.940
very subtle work I mean

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:11.160
um it's it's very uh uh subtle work but

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.399
um yeah so it's was that did that help

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:16.500
is that helpful

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.180
uh yes uh thank you for moving from the

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.700
individual to the other and the

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.980
inclusion and

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.080
um

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.060
I love there's no

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.980
there is a question and there's no

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.760
answer yet

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:37.700
yeah

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.300
this is an unresolved uh question in

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.220
Buddhist Scholastics

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.680
if people will go around I mean there's

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.140
tons and tons and tons written about it

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.180
so I wouldn't

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.000
necessarily

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.300
expect us to hone in on

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.459
uh

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:00.959
um yeah

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:03.240
an exact

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.579
um sense of it

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.640
um

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.740
I just want to say that I'm in complete

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.399
resistance to this exercise

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.200
and

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.820
because what I mean

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.579
how I'm hearing it is

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:25.440
I'm noticing a thing as in an object and

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.560
then I'm noticing me notice

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.620
an object I'm playing with the

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.079
that dynamic

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:37.440
and what's missing from me in this

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.220
is

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.980
being fashioned

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.260
in the moment

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.640
by the relationality with the object so

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.040
that the noticing in shifts from

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.500
noticing object as object

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.240
to

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.200
um

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.660
how am I alive

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.380
um

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.760
as opposed to

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.740
separate and noticing object how am I

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.760
in a flux so to speak in a in a flow

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.200
with

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.160
um

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.620
whatever's there and that feels to me

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.380
that's where

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.880
I I don't really want to go beyond that

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.560
but

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.620
um

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.579
I feel like I'll be in a place of

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:37.200
alienation

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.800
just between noticing object and

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.980
noticing me noticing object it doesn't

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.060
it doesn't

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.720
bring open it doesn't open for me

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.180
awareness

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.360
but then what do you mean by awareness

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.040
you just work use this one

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.500
active fluidity

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.260
with

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.779
and participation

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:11.579
with

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.660
what is there

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.339
right so

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:19.019
um I mean this is part of the practice

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:22.440
and this is a good thing to add to the

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.959
Insight practice exactly what you said

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:27.120
if that's your experience that that's

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.040
your experience

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.660
um but just be careful

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.940
we're actually not

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.399
the object itself is not what we're

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:38.120
investigating it's our lived experience

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.760
of seeing the object

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.360
um we're just using the object as a prop

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.459
um so some people

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.120
um some people do this practice in Zen

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.339
monasteries and they look at their mind

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:58.740
and then they're aware of their minds

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.600
and then they have to ask well what's

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.220
how what's being aware of their mind

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.220
this is way too

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.740
you don't have to go that subtle we can

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.100
use the object as a as a prompt instead

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.899
of some looking as a thought as a prop

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:18.540
um so we're what we're interested in is

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.480
the lived experience now if you could

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.240
describe what it feels like to oscillate

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.079
between being in the flow and being

00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:31.200
distance this is one of the things you

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.899
can describe this is a description of

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:37.560
the how you experience this instruction

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.839
so so

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:42.720
um in fact many people will describe an

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.420
oscillation and they'll use different

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.040
terms

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.199
um so

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.360
um but it's not really about the object

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.360
we're just using it as a prop

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.480
um and as I said in most

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.199
um like deep Zen Advanced Training you

00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:04.860
would be using thoughts in your head as

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.260
the object and asking the same question

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:12.240
if I if I don't focus on the thought

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.940
then what is left is it just awareness

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.540
uh if I drop so that that would be the

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.100
typical

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.079
um

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:26.399
typical Buddhist kind of instruction but

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:30.240
we're going to use a physical object

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.660
um to get it get started great question

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.420
but that's a that's a legit legitimate

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.380
way to report

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:42.260
um

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.420
I'm sorry this is my first one I've just

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:55.380
been a crazy few days but as you were

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.440
speaking I was drawn back to the

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.740
paragraph in which you talk about

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.860
what happens to you happens to me at the

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.839
same time I mean in this sort of

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:09.000
collective

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.860
sense

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.720
um and then

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.160
that I had a visceral reaction to your

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.600
words around we're tied together by one

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.839
causal yeah let's let's hold the

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:27.720
conversation go after the practice

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.579
because we are going to have a big

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:31.560
conversation last session we spent the

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.779
whole time on the conversation okay okay

00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:35.820
that question will be welcome

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.139
but let's do the practice and so JJ if

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:42.720
you didn't hear and Kimberly

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.399
um and I know Magdalena she won't forget

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.259
so she

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:49.139
just hold on to that I almost you almost

00:16:49.139 --> 00:16:52.380
got me I almost wanted to talk about it

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:55.740
um but I I did this last session and we

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.500
all we did was talk okay so if you

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.300
haven't heard the instruction you're

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.639
going to

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:05.160
um pay attention to something I suggest

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.540
one thing like a pencil and you're just

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.100
going to look at it and then the

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.540
question you're going to ask you're

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.520
going to say well I'm aware that I'm

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.020
looking at it

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.919
and

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.400
you wanna we wanna figure out is that

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.059
two things that happen simultaneously

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:29.820
is there an oscillation I'm looking and

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.299
I and then when I ask myself I'm aware

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:34.980
is

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.679
um if I find that I'm aware of looking

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:40.500
at the pencil can I drop looking at the

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.760
pencil and just be in Awareness itself

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.100
as some people say

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.200
um what are the oscillations that happen

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.320
are you are you looking at the pencil

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.200
and then you notice is a time lag and

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.660
I'm actually thinking about being aware

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.640
of looking at the pencil that would be

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.039
reflection after the fact is it

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.600
retrospective

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.940
like just these are all just words I'm

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.840
using but we just want to play with

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.580
um

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.200
what this word awareness is

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.100
um in this kind of practice

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.919
um it's you know the hard problem with

00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:25.620
Consciousness and we want to just

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.280
see if we can investigate it from first

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.620
person experience and from the

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.860
collective reporting which is helpful

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.960
because

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.640
it can give you perspectives and then

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.160
you can go and try again and see well

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.660
maybe that's a little what I'm

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.080
experiencing too or whatever okay so

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.360
we're going to do this for

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.080
uh 25 minutes you go back and forth from

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.360
I said just start by doing the practice

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.360
for a little bit and then you know just

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.580
someone can start and then someone might

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.280
say well let's go in for a second look

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.380
you know just just have it have its own

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.799
Rhythm for how much practice you do but

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:12.299
try to have a conversation really stay

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:13.860
um

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.380
you really want to watch or have a

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.179
conversation around your experience

00:19:18.179 --> 00:19:19.260
itself

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.640
okay

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.940
so Aaron's someone whatever Aaron ends

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.559
up you're gonna have to explain to him

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:28.020
what you're doing is that okay

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.400
and

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.179
um

00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:34.760
so uh this is for 25 minutes

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.940
Bonnie I've had a couple power blips

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.799
here so if I disappear I may end up back

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:51.660
in the main room okay and then I'll

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.400
throw you back in

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.799
all right enjoy your research and enjoy

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.539
your company Aaron they're going to let

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:03.260
you know what's going on

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.789
[Music]

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.039
I'm aware that it's 90 degrees in this

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:05.730
room and I'm a pathetic sweaty mess

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.150
[Music]

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.419
foreign

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.640
[Music]

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.640
well one thing

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.620
that we

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.980
discuss I mean shared whatever right in

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.299
the beginning

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:51.960
that I had a question about was whether

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.679
this was strictly looking

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:57.900
or whether

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.640
touching was also

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.580
in the research

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.740
you know

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.340
um some things that was

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.580
could expand to touch

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:19.380
and we kind of agreed

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.100
that

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.020
it was not

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.539
excluded

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:29.760
right you're just any object so you know

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.440
you could touch an object look at an

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.100
object hearing is kind of hard because

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.620
hearing comes and goes uh

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.260
and even like I said the food issues

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.380
thought as the object so

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.520
um yeah touching was a good one

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.240
I mean it

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.580
the way it meandered was actually

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.419
because it's just a small Stone

00:22:57.419 --> 00:23:00.179
um and very flat as

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:03.659
Cheryl said perfect skipping Stone

00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:06.419
um it was through the touch

00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.400
that I was able

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.919
to

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:14.820
really feel the emptying of my mind oh

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.600
you have one too

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.020
um

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.159
and then I guess

00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.600
um

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.020
after the touching then there was a

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.419
scale thing of it in relation to my hand

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:34.860
that became

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.539
something I

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:40.380
wouldn't have looked at necessarily I

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.500
mean the relationship between

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.400
its shape on my and that Drew Me In

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.820
and then it became time

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.780
as in the smoothness and how it had

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.840
become flat and I know that's starting

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.940
to do

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.340
but the thing I've metaphor yeah that's

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.480
good

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.000
but then the thing that I found most

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.380
fascinating

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.059
was that

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:11.520
after listening

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.299
to the others in my group

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.900
I realized that as I was listening

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.919
that I was going into their object

00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:26.179
in a very different way

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.799
because Cheryl has a

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:32.640
sunflower

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.840
but yeah that actually hasn't kind of

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.100
almost like an eye in the dark part

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.840
and I was feeling drawn in to the eye

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.000
you know and

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.380
so some Attunement had sort of taken

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.400
place

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.039
and and Aaron had this crystal

00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:01.380
stone that he had described feeling like

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.440
he was going in and out of caves

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.140
and I was already you know I was ready

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.020
to trip on that you know

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.780
um but it's interesting with Kimberly

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.320
she had talked about a fly and a leaf

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.460
and I was like nope nothing there

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.520
um

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.299
but I just felt this sort of

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:29.299
modality

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.279
that was available

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:36.000
you know or had become

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.480
available

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.240
and then of course I noticed that I had

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.320
noticed that you know and then and then

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.900
starts to be like this Loop yeah so

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.580
there's a certain type of where you're

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.279
gentle you notice you're aware but then

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:59.820
when you if it's more like notice it

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.440
becomes

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.659
you can feel the oscillation it becomes

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:05.880
mental energy and and then you have to

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.620
reset so that's yeah that's a good

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.419
that's that's that's a good report

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:17.520
I would say uh a couple things that

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.640
happened one was at one point

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.820
there is a shift from

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.860
looking

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.100
at to receiving

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.940
which actually then felt more like

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.980
participatory and that I feel like I

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.799
touched awareness more once I felt that

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:44.460
instead of my me trying to be aware

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.220
um it was way more relational

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.220
and and then at one point I thought

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.880
I went from I am aware to I am awareness

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.299
and that was a total shift

00:26:57.299 --> 00:27:00.720
when I said I am awareness the I

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.900
Disappeared for not completely just for

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.720
a moment but I could feel I could feel a

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.720
different like everything just got way

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.200
more infinite I could include way more

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.460
and every thing that my eyes fell on was

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.740
deeply moving and touching it wasn't

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.600
like I like this better than this or

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.360
this is prettier than this or I feel

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.520
this about this it was just everything

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.520
equally was

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.299
touching

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.799
and I I was with Liz and it was really

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:44.159
interesting that before what she is

00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:47.220
sharing which was a sense in which

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.840
we all were in that space in a way but

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.620
what happened first and what was that

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:57.600
there was a gap

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.539
between the looking and the asking of

00:28:00.539 --> 00:28:01.860
the question

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.940
and there was to return to the object

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.539
was very comfortable to return to the

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:12.419
looking was very comfortable as opposed

00:28:12.419 --> 00:28:15.419
to being with the question it was like a

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:17.580
shift of distance and

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.539
and then there was once that seemed to

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:22.520
be

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.000
acknowledged and spoken and we we

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.320
started to move into what Liz's ex is

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.659
sharing but there was also this

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:35.640
expansion

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.659
um it was a very powerful expansion

00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:41.279
um

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.140
yeah but just returning to the first

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.260
little bit the other thing that we all

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.500
of us noticed I think was that

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.779
while you could look at the object it

00:28:51.779 --> 00:28:55.740
was it very quickly the peripheral

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.799
or everything else came in and that also

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.720
in some ways

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.360
I don't know led to the expansion as

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.840
well the beginning of that expansion

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.900
yeah you know that's all I have to say

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.700
yeah I just want to quickly add to that

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.679
including like Sensations in the body

00:29:13.679 --> 00:29:15.659
and like

00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:18.299
suddenly it was like I'm aware of this

00:29:18.299 --> 00:29:19.799
and

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:22.700
so much more

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.100
not this at the exclusion of everything

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.520
else

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:45.799
um

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.179
of my rock my crystal not really

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:52.980
corresponding with how big it actually

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.940
is it was a very strange like I can hold

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.700
it in my hand

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.039
but it feels much bigger than something

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:04.080
I should be able to hold in my hand when

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.960
I dropped in it was

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.419
amazing that something that can have so

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:12.179
many millions of points of light in it

00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:14.520
could be held in my hand

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.559
um

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:18.299
and at that point I also started

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:20.760
noticing like whoa I can breathe really

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.820
deeply like I was in this place of

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.940
um

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.740
this is not what it seems to be right

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.360
it's not just something I can weigh and

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.559
measure it's

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.539
it's bigger than it looks I don't know I

00:30:36.539 --> 00:30:40.020
don't know anything more to say but like

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.820
yeah I had this sense that it was way

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.880
bigger than the illusion of what it

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.960
what it feels like

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.799
I have this notion that the focus of

00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:57.960
attention oscillates but awareness

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.000
doesn't and I don't know the distinction

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.399
between attention and awareness as I'm

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:04.740
speaking it but attention feels

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.299
different than awareness to it because

00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:08.039
there's a narrowing and a widening

00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:12.600
experientially of focused attention

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.200
and yet awareness seems

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.159
like that from which I draw to do that

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:23.760
that's just what I'm noticing and it's

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.679
just a suspicion don't know what that's

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:27.980
so

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.260
yeah in that closely parallels what Liz

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.460
is saying

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.299
um attention so retention is more

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:38.940
uh

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.000
uh active

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.320
and awareness is receptive so

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.600
um now it you know all these words mean

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.000
the same thing you feel that awareness

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.840
is

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.220
still looking at the pen but

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.779
becoming

00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:59.820
receptive

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.559
in a way of looking at it and then you

00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:03.899
have this expansion feeling

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:06.120
that a lot of you are talking about

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.000
whether the rock expands or your sense

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.440
of yourself that's that's uh yeah that's

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.000
all part of

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.380
this

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.559
word another interesting thing that I

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:21.240
noticed is there are moments when I did

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.360
it felt like I was seeing through my

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.520
eyes rather than with my eyes which is

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.799
pretty curious I think that's the other

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:31.320
that's part of the receptive

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.539
uh

00:32:33.539 --> 00:32:35.940
quality like

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.760
um maharisha you know talked about that

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.840
this is uh

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.020
clear light experience

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:50.279
where you feel like the light is coming

00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:52.440
through your eyes and Illuminating

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.000
something

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.059
um I think this is also associated with

00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:57.960
uh

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.279
passive or receptive stance versus

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:06.179
I don't know but there's that people

00:33:06.179 --> 00:33:09.020
report that

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:14.220
yeah like early on I just had this like

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.080
very simple pencil it's not even

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.519
sharpened yeah yeah I hope and so early

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.380
on I was like kind of get twizzling

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.519
around

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.019
um

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:27.539
and I just little little things that

00:33:27.539 --> 00:33:29.159
were would stand out like there was a

00:33:29.159 --> 00:33:30.419
little piece of glitter or there's like

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:31.620
a little

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.880
um

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.620
just like little piece of wood kind of

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:36.000
paying off and those things would like

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.840
really draw in uh yeah my attention

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.320
um and I I'd be like just really with

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.200
the object but then like I'd kind of you

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.120
know then kind of I'd have a sort of

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.799
awareness about oh how much I just got

00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:52.260
like sucked into that details and there

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:54.539
was this kind of oscillation of that but

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:55.440
then

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.419
there was also

00:33:57.419 --> 00:34:00.500
like later on kind of feeling that that

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.380
receptivity I think the kind of moving

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:06.500
more into sort of allocentric

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.500
uh awareness of it and it just it was a

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.060
lot more comfortable

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.560
right kind of there wasn't this kind of

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.659
exertion of energy as there is of a kind

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:18.119
of sort of pinpoint like kind of looking

00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:20.159
at a particular Park and then just

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.020
noticing yeah peripheral kind of really

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.659
coming in just being able to see the

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.780
I well like experience the whole object

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.480
more rather than kind of looking at it

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.980
in parts and

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.919
we're looking for details

00:34:34.919 --> 00:34:37.740
yeah so this is also very good noticing

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.159
because

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:43.159
um

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:46.020
different uh personalities different

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.080
entries into the work are different but

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:54.179
it's quite common for really one pointed

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:56.159
focused attention like when you were

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.119
really drawn into it

00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:03.060
then the backgrounds feel the expanse

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.660
pops out so this is unusual you wouldn't

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.640
have thought of this but the Buddhists

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.740
have known this for a long time that

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:14.220
certain types of focused attention can

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.560
trigger

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.260
the field of awareness the sense of

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.960
receptivity the sense that there's all

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.579
this space

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:26.640
um it does it doesn't work for everyone

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.380
um and and like what is

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.020
got there more naturally

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.320
um but if you have a very busy mind you

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.780
have to it's quite often you have to go

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:43.859
into one pointed concentration to

00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:46.800
experience what you would think would be

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.920
where you wouldn't go right

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.040
um but that is also

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.060
um

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.660
yeah that is also consistent with how

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.460
people

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.420
describe these experiences

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.980
um it's different than just getting

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.480
spaced out

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.560
you know because

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.480
if I'm just spaced out I can feel like

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.000
there's a lot of space

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.599
but the awareness of the vastness of

00:36:18.599 --> 00:36:20.040
things

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.700
is very clear-headed

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.359
um and that's why if you if you are you

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:30.839
know you have a a busy mind

00:36:30.839 --> 00:36:34.020
the concentration is a portal to the

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.680
awareness because it's not a spaced out

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.579
um

00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:41.160
experience

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.320
um so

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.760
um yeah

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.740
so they're not like it's not like

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.440
opponent processing either concentrating

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.480
or are you this they're they're much

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.820
more they're related and kind of

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.740
interest and interesting words

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:11.820
uh so Bonnie when you were talking about

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.619
your attention can you be active or your

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:15.599
awareness your attention is active and

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:18.119
your awareness is receptive

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:20.940
as soon as you said that I thought okay

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.440
that's

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.740
activating the relationality is that

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:29.160
having both sides of maybe of a polarity

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.260
and we might experience polarity in in a

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.800
other self and other but

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.400
um

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.520
I I don't really know how to go any

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.680
further with this but the idea that I

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.800
can be both attentive

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.560
and receptive

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:54.300
allows for a fluidity I think okay so

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.180
this is a very big insight and it was

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.040
similar to the words you were using

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.040
different words but the receptive in the

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:07.079
in the active were very similar and

00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:09.900
um so this made a big Insight that they

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.540
are not

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:17.160
um they're not opponents to each other

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.839
so

00:38:18.839 --> 00:38:19.560
um

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.200
uh

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.560
and if you find yourself oscillating

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.260
you can you the oscillation has got a

00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.660
lot of information in it like like you

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.099
might be

00:38:32.099 --> 00:38:35.339
very active about something like if I

00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:38.220
see if I see you know somebody someone

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.160
I'm working with people are rewriting

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.859
things for me and I I get to see I would

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:46.140
never use that word you know I get very

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.680
active I see it and I feel very active

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.160
um or then and then I can like well I'm

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.020
gonna read what they wrote and I'm just

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.640
going to be very receptive and I can

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.280
feel myself oscillating but how could I

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.260
be receptive with what they say and

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.359
still say no no no no no no we're not

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:04.980
going to use that word

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.960
this is one of one this is called it's

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.119
it's reflexivity because it you're

00:39:12.119 --> 00:39:14.280
tracking two different things it's also

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.560
called mindfulness so it's not about

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.300
just being

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.960
you know it's coming from receptivity

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:26.280
and being having Clarity around uh what

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.240
matters

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.660
and sometimes we just get when we try to

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.339
have Clarity we're over here and we're

00:39:32.339 --> 00:39:34.560
like that we have one Persona we're

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.420
receptive over here and we have that and

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.940
so how do we how do we integrate these

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.359
is the question so anytime you notice

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:44.280
yourself oscillating this is good

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.560
information because all you have to do

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.240
you don't have to make anything up you

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.040
just try to

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.560
bring those things just like we've been

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.480
doing closer and closer together

00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.920
um so

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.040
um that would be uh called non-dual

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.079
state or whatever

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:05.880
um but

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.220
um yeah that's a great it's a very big

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.200
insight

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.870
see it's inside practice

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.969
[Music]

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.160
who would have thought

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.000
um

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.740
does everybody understand that it's a

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.740
big it's a big Insight yeah

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.560
I had something interesting happen uh

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.300
when you were talking about that

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.359
activity and receptivity

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:36.060
I looked to see

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.140
I looked to see my awareness

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.300
and I became awareness of something

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.640
really

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.040
simple

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.640
that I love that nobody has entered a

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.720
chat

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.820
that we are 15 16 people

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.579
engaged and I know now that what matters

00:40:59.579 --> 00:41:03.420
to me is you and me

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.060
you all and me

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.920
so I'm glad you didn't chat today

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.520
okay 64 million dollar question

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:00.440
I'm going to give you a clue

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.520
and then I guess I'll put you back in

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.560
for 15 minutes

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.720
break out room to try to answer the

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:12.320
question okay

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.180
so

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.160
we notice

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.940
that there's this awareness and then we

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.520
notice that

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.980
the mind

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:28.920
kind of jumps around like

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.140
so I'm using I'm not using any of the

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.359
words you use I'm using real I don't you

00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:34.980
know really

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.800
um kind of gross words but anyways we

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.300
have this one pointed attention that can

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.400
you know it's either this point at that

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.440
point at that point I can go different

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.480
ways and then we have this receptive

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.390
awareness

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.580
[Music]

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.760
and so

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.820
um

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:06.780
so we have this notion of the mind being

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.440
having attention uh paying attention

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.319
concentrate your mind and so

00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:14.119
um

00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:17.060
what where does the

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:21.000
receptivity come from and if you

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.460
remember the name of this course

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.900
that will

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.900
give you

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.060
a

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.590
Chloe

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.599
[Music]

00:43:36.599 --> 00:43:40.079
so if the bouncing around mind is the

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:42.240
attention paying attention here and

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.220
there zooming in and out what is it that

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.500
serves up this

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:55.040
field of awareness 15 minutes

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.980
oh

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.520
foreign

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.859
[Music]

00:44:46.859 --> 00:44:51.920
Big Stretch right what you got

00:44:57.359 --> 00:44:59.170
um I ain't got nothing

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.319
[Laughter]

00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:02.700
um

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.680
with Samuel and Holly

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.280
so when we when we entered this second

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.780
session

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.579
Holly just says

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:17.119
body

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.079
so then the the the the the

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.800
it unfolded the conversation and

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.319
unfolded around

00:45:28.319 --> 00:45:33.359
you know you know the the felt sense of

00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:37.940
that the body is is

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.119
both producing and grounding

00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:45.200
the experience

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.560
um I don't know

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.339
um

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.900
we we talked about

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.900
how

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.920
how the space between things felt

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.980
connected and

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.500
um not empty

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.000
that that

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.079
the objects

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.060
um and in our bodies in space

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.680
uh

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.859
were existed in a connected field of

00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:27.900
awareness

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.240
I don't know these words sound silly

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.460
saying them but

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.800
that that's what the conversation kind

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.579
of revolved around

00:46:37.859 --> 00:46:41.900
Samuel Holly anything to add

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.420
we also talked towards the end about a

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.339
kind of overwhelm

00:47:02.339 --> 00:47:04.880
of

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.859
recognizing a kind of

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:10.020
Perfection and patterns of perfection

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.720
and the overwhelm of that and then

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.560
coming back to the body and

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.660
the body isn't overwhelmed by that

00:47:41.099 --> 00:47:46.280
the body lives in space in openness

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.040
yeah that's it

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.839
I just added that like reflecting on the

00:48:09.839 --> 00:48:11.780
um yeah that oscillation between

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.160
expansiveness and again that

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.040
overwhelmedness the expansiveness

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.920
and then that return the oscillation

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.359
back into

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:24.420
the reality of like flesh and blood and

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.839
like bumping up against

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.400
um other bodies

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.599
in a very physical way

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.420
s

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.940
did everybody come to that answer the

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.500
body

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.300
um

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.200
more than other

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.819
I kind of set it up but

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.119
so now now I'm going to we're going to

00:49:06.119 --> 00:49:08.880
do this exercise really quick I'm going

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.940
to demo word so the question we were

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.099
working is what are you aware of when

00:49:14.099 --> 00:49:17.839
you are aware that you're aware

00:49:18.359 --> 00:49:21.420
what are you aware of when you are aware

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:24.060
that you're aware and so if we look at

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.440
some of

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.300
um you don't have to buy into this but

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.520
I'm looking at the pencil

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:32.099
then I'm just looking at the pencil and

00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:35.359
then I want to know

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.060
if I'm aware of the pencil and I asked

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.800
myself well what I'm aware of

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.260
when I'm aware that I'm aware

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.579
and two things can happen

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:56.119
I can take it mental Journey

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.960
and we all are very good at at noticing

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.980
that identified or I can get into this

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.000
receptive way

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.780
and I realized I'm becoming aware of my

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.300
body in space

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.720
and I'm aware

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:20.940
so that what I'm aware of I'm aware that

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.920
I'm aware is my body and space and and

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.619
I'm also

00:50:28.619 --> 00:50:32.640
aware that the body is not limited to

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.319
space and that my body lives in openness

00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:41.520
and this is what I'm alluded to because

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.579
the Traditions start with looking at

00:50:44.579 --> 00:50:46.740
thought and you think it's something in

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.900
your mind and you get spaced out and

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.660
then you think awareness is something in

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.140
your spaced out mind and they rob us of

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.599
the wildness the causal wildness of our

00:50:57.599 --> 00:51:01.020
body this is over and over and over and

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.480
over again in these traditions and it

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.220
drives me nuts

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.660
makes me a lunatic

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.020
okay I I had to

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.280
and I think they're mistranslations but

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.920
we have like the bodies in the gross

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.420
realm it's heavy it don't move it's it's

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.839
Compact and it's dense right this is how

00:51:36.839 --> 00:51:39.240
we talk about the body I mean it's like

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.880
the malware it goes very deep because

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.700
even just in if we haven't done Buddhist

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.180
practices and stuff this is in our our

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.020
our you know Western it's in even in

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.260
Catholicism it's in the it's in

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:59.460
it's it it's what happened on the axial

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.559
age we got tripped out with thoughts in

00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:04.920
our head and then everything moved in

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.960
this direction

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:11.099
and why does it matter because

00:52:11.099 --> 00:52:13.859
this other direction because we're

00:52:13.859 --> 00:52:17.339
ruining nature we're destroying nature

00:52:17.339 --> 00:52:21.960
and it's because we don't understand

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:26.599
that were isomorphic to Nature

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.740
so

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.280
the openness of the mind is served up by

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.579
the open awareness of the body which is

00:52:35.579 --> 00:52:37.980
a perfect reflection of what nature is

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:42.000
it's open awareness it's open it's an

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.640
open Dimension it's a quality of what

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.980
existence is

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:50.780
it's a quality of openness

00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:54.359
and

00:52:54.359 --> 00:52:56.660
this is

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.900
power work

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:03.180
constructing this new theory of the body

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:07.400
it is the field of awareness

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.460
that is continuous with the openness of

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.880
reality

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:24.960
and it seems like also some of the

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.480
limitation and particularity of that

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.660
reality right like it's open but it's

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.240
also

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:36.839
it's not it's not virtual it's not

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:38.760
anywhere in the world it's where I am

00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.160
right here right now that's the point at

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:46.760
which I have contact with what is

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.700
um

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.540
yeah yeah this is beautiful because

00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.000
it's not open in the way the mind is

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.599
which is combinatorially explosive

00:54:00.599 --> 00:54:03.420
and we think that there is something

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.300
can't be open and have contact at the

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.819
same time I mean you don't this is what

00:54:08.819 --> 00:54:12.619
you're saying this is a misunderstanding

00:54:12.619 --> 00:54:16.380
of uh what contact is because we're

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.319
contacted with the word world we're

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:22.319
contacted with its quality which is real

00:54:22.319 --> 00:54:25.800
on the one hand and open and I have to

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.859
say real and open because we think the

00:54:28.859 --> 00:54:32.099
date those two words somehow are not the

00:54:32.099 --> 00:54:34.500
same quality

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:37.800
um and so this this can be just a

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.540
mystery how can something be real and

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.880
open at the same time you could write a

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.859
metaphysics about it

00:54:43.859 --> 00:54:48.119
um it's probably just better to say it's

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:50.700
a mystery but that it's a mystery that's

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.980
solved with a certain experience of

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.540
certainty

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.119
um that you can gain from doing some of

00:54:57.119 --> 00:55:00.300
these practices and so

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.500
um yeah I loved what you said and and

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.619
um

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.099
it's not virtual in that sense I mean we

00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.900
can do virtual things that's cool too

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.220
but

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.880
um it can be open and

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.640
contact that's really a nice word to put

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:24.200
with that thank you

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.319
yeah I think it brings me into a sense

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:31.619
of my awareness of the relationality

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:34.559
when I'm when I am situated in a

00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:36.900
particular context

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.559
um

00:55:37.559 --> 00:55:41.700
and then I mean I have Encounters of of

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.119
particularity of embeddedness and then

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:50.160
along with that comes more of a sense of

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.520
um care

00:55:54.119 --> 00:55:56.040
ing

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.099
what happens to it this is all going to

00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:01.200
open up when we come back in the fall

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.359
because

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:06.599
we're compounded by other organisms that

00:56:06.599 --> 00:56:08.160
have a certain amount of awareness and

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.079
then there's the super organism that's

00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:15.180
aware you know all this we're going to

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:18.059
um try to express

00:56:18.059 --> 00:56:19.859
um

00:56:19.859 --> 00:56:21.599
but

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:22.319
um

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:24.900
if we know that awareness comes from the

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.900
body it's much easier to express uh

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.000
collective intelligence or Collective

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.980
consciousness

00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:36.240
um as both real and

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.700
um different than liminality which is

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:43.319
mind meld and and stuff so so

00:56:43.319 --> 00:56:46.140
yeah and then we come you know my heart

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:49.020
strings then we come close to being able

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.059
to be taken seriously by scientists

00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:53.400
because we're saying yeah like what's

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.800
sacred is our body and our body is

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.960
nature we know something about those

00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:01.319
things from a scientific perspective we

00:57:01.319 --> 00:57:05.579
reject with reductive materialism but uh

00:57:05.579 --> 00:57:07.520
yeah we believe there's gut

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:10.140
microorganisms in me that have something

00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.000
to do with my psychology guess what

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.460
their bodies in space too

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.819
they're in spaces inside of me

00:57:17.819 --> 00:57:20.400
um so

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:24.740
yeah this is this is

00:57:25.559 --> 00:57:28.440
what we're producing here

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.960
I mean some of the I you know a lot of

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.540
these ways of really articulating have

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.440
been born in this in this years

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.800
in these in in this experience with you

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.140
I mean I I have not written

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.180
you know if I try to

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.920
we're really getting close to being able

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:53.520
to to say this in a kind of a useful way

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.680
you know if I sat down for this course

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.300
and tried to say this it would be going

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.280
to write geeking

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.440
esoteric paper I said no one can

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.619
understand

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.579
all these things are like

00:58:13.619 --> 00:58:16.400
what make

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:19.500
the transcendental spaced out mind thing

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.540
so seductive

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.980
and the body based thing quite

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:27.440
um

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.960
it's not problematic right but it's it's

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.800
scary

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.260
it's scarier

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.740
to be grounded in in body

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:41.400
because of death disease decay

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.599
causal wildness

00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.940
yeah we'll have to come to terms with

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:51.380
that too but yeah because we we

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.180
associate

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.220
term

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:57.240
determination of

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:00.119
something with death

00:59:00.119 --> 00:59:02.240
um

00:59:03.319 --> 00:59:06.119
we're going to talk about when we get to

00:59:06.119 --> 00:59:08.819
I'm not sure I'm writing another a book

00:59:08.819 --> 00:59:11.640
for perspectiva which is called the one

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.040
Once and Future God

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.960
and the way it's going to address this

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:18.240
is to

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:21.059
we I wrote about it either in the

00:59:21.059 --> 00:59:22.799
Socrates

00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:25.619
is that

00:59:25.619 --> 00:59:27.720
everything that exists

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.780
today gets completely metabolized oh

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:34.619
yeah it's the first amid was still alive

00:59:34.619 --> 00:59:37.799
um and I'm gonna argue this is also true

00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:40.200
for God or a source he's it's completely

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.040
metabolized in us so you could never get

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:47.579
outside of existence and point to God uh

00:59:47.579 --> 00:59:50.240
because of this rolling

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.059
completely metabolized into

00:59:54.059 --> 00:59:56.220
the next moment to the next moment to

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:58.260
the next moment and it's also true for I

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.599
ourselves you know like when we think

01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:02.520
about some of these memories like our

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.640
memories and our it it it's we can't go

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.460
back and find my not I can't go back and

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.380
point to my nine-year-old self she's

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:14.640
completely metabolized into this and

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.839
um

01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:19.619
so you're right in order to uh

01:00:19.619 --> 01:00:22.680
produce something like this we have to

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:26.119
have a way to assuage

01:00:26.119 --> 01:00:29.339
uh this question of death

01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:31.740
uh which is always what a spiritual or

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.599
religious uh

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:39.660
um task has has to take up it has to be

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.420
able to say something about that

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.980
[Music]

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:47.520
and not right Sam Harris like

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.400
I want to say something to that because

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.540
we were just talking about this today

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:57.240
and any one of you who can contribute I

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.040
would be grateful

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:03.420
but there's a absolutely unicorn piece

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:07.160
of land near a village that

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.640
um

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.819
we just can't stand the idea that it

01:01:11.819 --> 01:01:13.980
will be you know somebody's private

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:16.740
Villa even though that was somebody's

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.420
original intention

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.940
and today

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:24.359
um this whole notion of an endless

01:01:24.359 --> 01:01:28.799
Cemetery because if you actually compost

01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:31.680
the human bodies and

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:34.680
plant a tree on it I mean I know it

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.460
sounds gimmicky too in a way but the

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.380
idea that you don't run out of room

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:44.099
because you're truly composting

01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:45.599
and

01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:47.640
you just have to go back and get bones

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.000
and grind them down at some point I mean

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.319
but

01:01:52.319 --> 01:01:53.160
um

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.680
I don't know if anybody knows anything

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.040
about this but we we got pretty serious

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.599
about

01:02:00.599 --> 01:02:03.680
because it would

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.740
regenerate land that used to be forests

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.160
and keep regenerating

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:11.940
um

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.819
and we just

01:02:14.819 --> 01:02:17.099
the idea that you can just keep

01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:20.339
composting you don't run out of room

01:02:20.339 --> 01:02:22.980
for boxes or

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.240
urns or

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.760
whatever

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.280
and somehow all three of us who are

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.859
Elders here were like

01:02:31.859 --> 01:02:35.540
I want to go there

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.500
so I don't know

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.819
yeah my garden Over My Dead Horse you

01:02:41.819 --> 01:02:45.059
know just a lot of active microbial

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:49.859
activity happening in there uh

01:02:49.859 --> 01:02:52.920
and one of my older Ducks died the other

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.240
day and

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.920
would just

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.260
wrapped her in some paper towels so

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.839
because we don't like the throat I don't

01:03:00.839 --> 01:03:02.700
like to throw the dirt over their eyes

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.260
and stuff but just

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.200
you know cotton cotton towels

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.000
and and

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.400
I remember thinking you know she ate a

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.859
lot of worms when she was alive and not

01:03:13.859 --> 01:03:16.920
alarms are gonna eat her like

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.579
there

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.559
well especially spoke to me with this

01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:37.920
Realty line because I look outside and

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.260
it's in me that the tree grows and we

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.540
kind of think about that as being said

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:46.700
when you're alive but why not you know

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:50.520
as you're composting yes it's in me that

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.079
the tree grows you know

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.540
um I'm intrigued by this

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.839
fear of the body of the western mind the

01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:30.420
resistance to embodiment and uh

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.059
what you said by the open Bonnie the

01:04:33.059 --> 01:04:36.720
openness of the mind is served up by the

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.579
openness in the body

01:04:38.579 --> 01:04:40.140
and

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.200
um

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.980
and all of the way that thought uh is a

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.079
departure the stock goes off on these

01:04:49.079 --> 01:04:52.020
trajectories of of meaning and structure

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:55.040
and and

01:04:56.819 --> 01:04:59.460
it seems to me and and then and then a

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.200
developed sense of maybe of selfhood

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.760
even if you decide to have a metaphysics

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.680
that there is no self there's still if

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:06.480
you're not in the body you're still

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.059
developing something that is

01:05:09.059 --> 01:05:10.920
um

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.700
made fashioned by your own fashioning

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.339
if you go into the body the experience

01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:18.720
is

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.819
that subjectivity

01:05:20.819 --> 01:05:23.220
aliveness

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.480
is

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.540
multiple a Multiverse it's all over the

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.520
place it's in all different aspects of

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.440
the bodies and all different aspects of

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.839
the world and and that there's this

01:05:33.839 --> 01:05:38.099
constant play of of subjectivity and it

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:40.319
seems to me that

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:43.380
the challenge is

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:49.280
how do I be a self how do I be

01:05:49.619 --> 01:05:52.020
in the midst of that

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:57.299
uh multi multi-being you know and I I

01:05:57.299 --> 01:05:58.319
think it's

01:05:58.319 --> 01:06:01.079
exciting and

01:06:01.079 --> 01:06:02.520
um

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.400
it's the task of being

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:08.359
is to be both

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.200
I'm not sure if I said that very well

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.839
but yeah well this makes me think of

01:06:12.839 --> 01:06:13.740
like

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.380
not all but not

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:20.099
so this is why it's really sad

01:06:20.099 --> 01:06:25.099
because not everybody's body feels open

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.280
um and and the more toxic the world

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.400
becomes the more

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.319
um

01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:37.380
people want to escape their bodies

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.539
because they can't move and they can't

01:06:39.539 --> 01:06:41.640
breathe and they can't

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.700
uh walk and

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.859
um you know obesity and I'm not saying

01:06:46.859 --> 01:06:49.440
obese people can't have these

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.819
experiences but in general

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.099
um this is not

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:56.819
um

01:06:56.819 --> 01:07:00.299
in the direction of

01:07:00.299 --> 01:07:03.000
these insights

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.920
um and

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.559
um

01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:10.079
mental health issues you don't want to

01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:12.240
be in your body you don't you feel

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.160
trapped people feel trapped in their

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.799
body gen the gender dysphoria

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:20.099
all these things are are really horrible

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:23.339
really would be really hard to get this

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:26.339
message across to you know young people

01:07:26.339 --> 01:07:30.839
who this is their actual experience

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.559
um so

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:38.039
I mean that you know me it makes me very

01:07:38.039 --> 01:07:38.819
um

01:07:38.819 --> 01:07:41.339
very sad

01:07:41.339 --> 01:07:43.460
um

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.559
and angry bodies or all these you know

01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:52.680
um but mostly these talks that have

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.079
toxins

01:07:55.079 --> 01:07:56.520
um yeah

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.680
young people don't want to be in their

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.900
bodies

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.720
and it's not because of that it's

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:05.640
because

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.400
this is Adam Mizner said that the

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.260
purpose of practice is to make you feel

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.280
at home in your body

01:08:14.039 --> 01:08:17.599
and then you can begin

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:19.759
um

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.940
this is like ripping on your thing of

01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.319
like nature in the body not being

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.960
separate right and

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.520
um

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.120
yeah have an inner and outer affecting

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.819
each other the more we screw up nature

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:41.460
the less likely we will have bodies that

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.500
can be comfortable in themselves if we

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.319
have this open Nature because what

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:49.980
basically closing nature we're reducing

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:53.420
its openness it's it's

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.880
receptivity to life

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.080
it's all the same

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.199
and

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.160
yeah

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.500
and there there are so many forces that

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.739
are moving us away from the true

01:09:10.739 --> 01:09:13.319
Simplicity and pleasure

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:16.859
of noticing it yeah right like that's

01:09:16.859 --> 01:09:21.000
part of many treatments for mental

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.520
health issues is is just coming into

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.620
noticing it at first there's so much

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.560
discomfort and then there's

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:31.080
maybe just a hint just a touch of

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:34.500
something that feels okay and

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.900
just capitalizing on that and nourishing

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:39.239
that feeding it building it into

01:09:39.239 --> 01:09:42.080
something that

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:46.560
connects the the pleasure of being a

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.640
being with other beings

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:53.640
yeah and it's it's like my story of the

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.100
cows like you

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.440
you have these videos with the first

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.679
time cows see grass and they're they

01:10:01.679 --> 01:10:03.179
have they think it's an extraordinary

01:10:03.179 --> 01:10:05.219
they have an extraordinary experience

01:10:05.219 --> 01:10:07.980
but it's ordinary however

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:11.340
if Humanity goes long enough they will

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.679
not be able to tolerate there'll be cows

01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.600
that will not be able to tolerate the

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.960
grass

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.719
because it's a shock you know that was

01:10:21.719 --> 01:10:23.940
in my before Socrates shock of existence

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:25.679
here's a shock

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.179
that we're not the center of the world

01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:29.520
why why should that be a shock right oh

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.199
cool there's other things out there

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:34.159
we've been

01:10:34.159 --> 01:10:36.960
manage this this this notion's been

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.480
manufactured and then when it's called

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.659
that the question is a shock

01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:46.100
um all these things are

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.260
um

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.659
things to work on but you know there's a

01:10:51.659 --> 01:10:54.420
lot of people uh working on this I

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.120
couldn't have taught this course uh 10

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.260
years ago even at the Master's level

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.600
um there's not enough awareness I would

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.920
say

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.980
um

01:11:07.199 --> 01:11:09.659
yeah I think what happens now is a lot

01:11:09.659 --> 01:11:11.760
of people are you know you're reading a

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.080
lot of different things you're listening

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.699
to a lot of different podcasts so you're

01:11:14.699 --> 01:11:17.820
putting it together whereas 15 years ago

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.219
people who would work with like

01:11:20.219 --> 01:11:21.960
awareness or something they were under

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.540
lineage and the lineages have these

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.400
problems so

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.120
um

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.640
um so something cool is happening

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.820
um and uh

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:35.040
all right

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.520
yeah

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.320
just something

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.239
that's reminding me of this rock right

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:45.179
the um the image of the body

01:11:45.179 --> 01:11:48.120
what it appears in a mirror is actually

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.460
very very different than what it feels

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.540
like yeah

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.520
and um

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.560
I I mean a lot of the people I work with

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.080
it's it's it's very much about

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.760
it doesn't matter what you look like in

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.199
the mirror maybe it does but it matters

01:12:01.199 --> 01:12:03.480
more to other people or your

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.000
relationship to other people but the

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.340
feeling the juicy feeling of being a

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.120
body

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.780
is way way bigger than what

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.460
you look like

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.900
um

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.300
that's that's it's just interesting to

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:22.440
tie it back to that yes exactly

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.840
okay I'll I'll upload this video right

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.679
away I already copied quote

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.480
to put with it

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.980
and

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:35.880
um

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.179
yeah it was it was a great session and

01:12:39.179 --> 01:12:42.480
thank you for for doing the work

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.800
um because it is it is good work

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.480
um

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.800
and have a good day



## Cohort 4

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.020
hello hello I'm in a green room today

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.280
that's house upstate New York

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.179
um

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.020
okay

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.240
um

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.840
so what we're after we're going to start

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.859
with a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.320
kind of a meditation

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.320
but what we're after is

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.059
what are we aware of when we are aware

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.940
that we are aware

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.100
what are we aware of

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.280
when we are aware that we are aware

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.780
so I was listening to Robert's uh do a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.620
guided meditation

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.300
and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.040
um you know all the emphasis is on

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.720
mental space

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.780
and I would like to try to do guided

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.380
meditation that is consistent with what

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.119
we've been doing this year putting your

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.920
mind back in the body and the body back

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640
into nature

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.720
so

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780
um

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.400
so the first thing we're going to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.740
actually follow the course outline and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.400
we just want to get comfortable and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460
um

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.320
relax into our bodies

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.020
and just do the first thing we did in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.520
the very first session on our

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.159
dispositional state just kind of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.400
get in touch with like the general mood

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.020
or

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.500
sense of our energy

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.860
where the flow and rhythm is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
just to familiarize ourselves or where

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.040
we're at

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.860
doesn't matter

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.560
what you discover

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.179
doesn't matter what you find

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.220
and just gently notice that you're aware

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.099
of this dispositional state don't take

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.700
it too far

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.120
then we want to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360
notice that we're aware of things we see

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.280
the things we hear

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.680
somehow we're not confined

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.160
to these dispositional Sensations but

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.319
Were Somehow open

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.340
to the world

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.519
and that our perception

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.019
extends ourselves into the world

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.519
just be aware of that

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.299
these perceptions are available

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.560
they do their thing

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.500
they do their thing whether I'm

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.060
attending to them or not

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.959
you'll feel just be aware of this body

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.560
that is somehow

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.259
in this dispositional state and open to

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.740
the world

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.560
I want you to relax your mind when I

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.900
give the next instruction

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.840
you know let it get too aggressive

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.860
I just want you to notice that you've

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.419
been

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.660
a flowing dispositional stake aware of

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.000
Perceptions in the world

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.040
for a long long time

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.120
that whole field of awareness spread out

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.800
across your lifetime

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.259
so notice how you're aware

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.780
there's been a larger field Through Time

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.720
all that that you have seen all that

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.580
that you have heard all that you have

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.060
felt

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.759
this large field of awareness

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.940
imagine yourself into a future

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.940
of all the things that are available and

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.419
not yet

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.840
and noticed you're all aware

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.100
of the openness

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.380
of this dispositional body

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.600
and this perceptual awareness

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.979
open

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.900
through the future that's not yet

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.699
well

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.400
then notice how

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.479
part of this

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.259
has been

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.699
being aware of

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.860
realities that are there and not there

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.080
at the same time these encounters

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.419
counters with the cell counselors

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:26.180
representative

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.220
higher beings encounter with the sense

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.479
of purpose we counter with

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.199
mathematical properties

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.919
and he realized that that field of

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.120
awareness

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.199
is infinite

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.440
and somehow it's open and available

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.699
even though you may not be able to

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:15.259
attend to all of it

00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:29.419
now

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.760
think of your dispositional state as

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.219
awareness itself that has flown through

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.260
this hole

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.099
Journey

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.360
and see that it's possible to have a

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.820
disposition of state that is like this

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.680
opening

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.540
field of awareness

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.260
that doesn't float away

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.940
it's more like a Wellspring that

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.320
emanates

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.680
and continuously flows

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.940
doesn't float away

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.980
it spills out into these larger and

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.880
larger fields

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.680
from the energy

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.420
that we call arousal

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.560
so somehow we are here

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.779
but not contained

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:29.399
hi Bonnie hi hi it's um it's Kim I

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.740
um arrived a little bit late I guess

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.940
people are already in their rooms

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.160
no we're all here we're meditating you

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.040
can't see us I'm sorry that's okay we

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.920
just felt done and we noticed that you

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.680
seamlessly entered into this vast

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.779
awareness

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:50.700
can you see us I'm so embarrassed okay

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.220
yes no I can't hold on no yes no I can't

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.720
sorry okay

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.740
no it's fine it's perfect we will report

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.399
to you

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.560
I could have made you wait I thought it

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.779
was perfect but

00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:15.660
you came in when you did okay

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.680
that was it

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.700
the idea is that we get the feeling that

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.920
we have to separate here's the bodily

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.660
felt experience and now I get into this

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.760
vast space of awareness and there's no

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.180
there's there's no there's like a gap in

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.800
between right

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.640
this is how we listen to most people

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.940
talk about the field of awareness

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.000
um

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.980
so that would be a more

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.240
I mean it follows our course you notice

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.579
um it followed our course pretty

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:07.140
directly

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.980
as a

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:13.100
uh meditation

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.120
structure so

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.220
um yeah interested in

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.420
what you're experiencing

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:36.120
thank you for that meditation it was

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.779
wonderful

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.800
um

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.420
and my friends

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.060
I miss you

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.180
um

00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:54.959
so one thing that was pretty sweet that

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:57.480
happened is when you when you invited us

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.980
to expand awareness across time

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.260
backwards

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.639
um my immediate sense was also forward

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.339
so then your invitation afterwards to

00:13:11.339 --> 00:13:14.040
also extend it forward

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.880
um

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.880
was like oh wow

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.500
I'm glad

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.940
I went there all already

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.760
um

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:32.579
um and also I was just reading

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:35.240
um the effect and the spirits the

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.220
dispositions article

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.360
um

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.339
um

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:45.899
and as I was reading it and it was my

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.899
sense also that this invitation you had

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:52.760
at the very end of the meditation

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.860
of

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.100
um

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.500
shift in perception or perhaps

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.300
experience

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.079
of

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.440
this dispositional state in you know

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.660
conventional psychology that is

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.399
generally talked about as pretty fixed

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:20.760
is really not the case and through these

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.360
practices or these I don't know what

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.459
practices but for me it's somatic

00:14:26.459 --> 00:14:28.940
practices

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.540
um what we're really shifting

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.079
is uh is the dispositional state

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:40.199
and then I was wondering reading the

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:43.019
article if because I wasn't in most of

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:46.940
the classes if you have identified

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.800
dispositional States like if there are

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.899
like five of them ten of them two of

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:54.600
them my perception of it is they're like

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.720
two main dispositions that's the

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.600
contracted State versus the expanded

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.040
State perhaps

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.699
and maybe there are

00:15:05.699 --> 00:15:07.440
ones that

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.839
we identify out of those but I was

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:11.579
curious about that

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:13.579
um

00:15:13.699 --> 00:15:16.380
this is some of what came up for me

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.120
thank you for this meditation it was

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.560
love

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.720
yeah so that's one way to look at it

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:25.980
basic contraction versus expansion

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.720
um but

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.540
we don't try we try not to psychologize

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.000
your dispositional state

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.459
because

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:36.560
um

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.839
we so if you read that little Gap table

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.959
it's like can I be with whatever

00:15:41.959 --> 00:15:45.120
dispositional state I'm in and notice

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.180
that it comes things come and go they

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.940
don't it doesn't stay the same so we're

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.000
more interested in

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.060
um being comfortable

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.519
with whatever dispositional state I have

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:02.579
because it's it's not true that everyone

00:16:02.579 --> 00:16:05.100
some people are going to be nervous

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.199
people all the time

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.540
it's just the body or the karma or

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.120
whatever and some people are going to be

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:17.820
so the when we work with dispositional

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.820
State we want to be very careful that

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.519
we're not even giving you know

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:27.240
positively and negatively balancing it

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.660
and that we're comfortable with

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.500
this is what it is the reality of it

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.519
um

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.259
so if you start positively and

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:39.720
negatively valence it you start to

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.459
Prejudice and you get into ethics you're

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:43.920
either afraid or if you're or you're

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.060
angry or you know you this it starts to

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.600
take on more

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.100
psychological quality which is fine then

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.740
you just watch you know you just attend

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.540
to that but

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.639
um but yes it's it's

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:03.420
commonly used that way and

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.540
um

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.579
uh yeah I used to talk about about it

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.459
like that in terms of Tai Chi but it's

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:13.980
more like

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.079
getting to know your body and being

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:18.360
comfortable in it

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.919
um because some people really you know

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:24.000
you have a energy signature and

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.120
um

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:32.820
it's not the BR and all of something

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.559
but this meditation is interesting

00:17:34.559 --> 00:17:36.900
because you notice that you start the

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.520
dispositional state

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.679
it feels like it's right there and then

00:17:40.679 --> 00:17:44.039
we open into like awareness and then the

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:46.260
idea is like

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.600
what if your dispositional state was

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.179
like this field of awareness

00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:54.380
it would be less

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.380
yeah

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.799
and in fact every dispositional state

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:05.160
opens in that direction you you do your

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.960
primary arousal

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.299
proceeds now you open into the world and

00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:11.460
then it you think of your past and your

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.940
future now you're open to this larger

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.960
awareness and then you know like this

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.260
every moment is an expansion

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:27.440
into these these larger awarenesses

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:32.160
so yes and no but you can see why

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.380
what I'm saying about

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.240
um some people are just going to be

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.919
you might say Contracting all the time

00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:48.080
but we're really just saying you know

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.039
yeah

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:52.559
it's like the the frog is ready to jump

00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.260
all the time when a predator comes is he

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.940
contracted

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.460
you know

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.580
he's just I love it I I mean that move

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.100
you're talking about of if I am a

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.559
constantly nervous person and

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:09.780
I have my version of that I am a

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.039
constantly

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:12.720
something personally I don't want to

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.919
name it right now in public

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.980
um

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:25.559
that I find uh like one of my Zan

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:27.440
Buddhist practitioner

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.000
uh practice partner he he talks about

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.960
how Bliss is not the absence of pain

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.600
for example

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.299
um so the fact that I actually can be

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:46.980
more expanded to hold whatever I am

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.080
um

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.160
in in the awakeness and aliveness

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.140
that

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.140
I can maintain

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:58.679
um

00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:02.520
that is in itself an expanded state

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.240
exactly

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.179
but would you say there are then I don't

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:10.919
know when we talk about dispositional

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:13.980
States it it includes things like I

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.380
guess this is me trying to name it and

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.679
you're trying not to name it

00:20:18.679 --> 00:20:21.299
nervousness is that a dispositional

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:23.400
statement yeah those are words people

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.640
use because it's it's it's not really an

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.500
affect you're not really angry you're

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.919
not really afraid it's a mood I mean we

00:20:31.919 --> 00:20:33.780
only have certain number of words we can

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.179
use so you could you people go like I'm

00:20:36.179 --> 00:20:39.720
kind of nervous or like I you know they

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.880
say things like that

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.160
um but

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.400
um there aren't any formal definitions

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.620
for

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.880
dispositional States really I mean you

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.799
can go in there and do neuroscience and

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:55.140
figure out what's going on in the gut in

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.419
the brain and stuff but

00:20:57.419 --> 00:20:59.700
um yeah you know a lot of some people

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.860
say bandwidth like

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.960
do you have a lot you you you're

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.360
throwing a party do you have a lot of

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.799
band you know there's going to be a lot

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.419
do you feel like you have a lot of

00:21:09.419 --> 00:21:11.460
bandwidth for whatever happens you know

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.559
so that you can use that term as a

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:14.820
disposition State I don't have any

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.340
bandwidth left or whatever

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.120
um so the words we use are

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.059
you try to you know

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.320
we don't really they're not really

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.140
accurate because but

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.280
um

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.140
because if you say I'm really really

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.020
angry in our taxonomy by then you're in

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.919
a in an asset the full-blown asset

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:40.260
um so

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.480
that's the you know the word really is

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.960
the mood it's like a mood just the

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.039
environs from

00:21:55.679 --> 00:21:58.919
tired foggy

00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:01.080
all these words can be dispositional

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.799
states too

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.900
alive you know some people just I just

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.520
really feel alive like that's a

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.080
dispositional state what does it mean

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.440
it's

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.860
foreign

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.100
like this so this is new

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.940
so I don't have words but I do

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.120
like what you're bringing in

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.179
and bringing the

00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:53.220
I'm taking with bringing the Mind into

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.039
the body and experiencing that

00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:58.799
during the meditation

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:02.340
and going out with that too so

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.320
I'm just saying I appreciate what you're

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.559
doing but I never have been in a

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:11.220
tradition to analyze like this so

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.480
I welcome it

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:25.260
I'm not sure if it's really analyzing

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.740
but it's nice to feel

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.780
dispositional stages

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.299
instead of the anxiety the emotional

00:23:33.299 --> 00:23:37.320
turmoil and to be at this type of peace

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.880
and to expand it and uh but then also to

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.940
let the body do the

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.480
feeling

00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:50.760
so this is a key Insight if the body

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.559
knows how to do this

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.539
we don't have to learn with our minds

00:23:57.539 --> 00:23:59.640
how to do it and then somehow instruct

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.780
our bodies it's really a trusting that

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.380
it's a you know an up hierarchy the

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.360
energy comes from the world up through

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.140
these expansions and

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.200
um

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.620
like you can be here right here now

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.260
was that ramdas is that right

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.179
this is very ROM documents they could be

00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:35.820
right here now and

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.820
aware of this very large

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.460
field of awareness

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.799
you don't have to like start to

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:45.600
dissociate from the body and then get

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.780
into this simulation you know what I'm

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.860
saying and then

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.700
yeah I like that

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.720
there's an organicity to it

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.720
yeah Simplicity and a layered a layered

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.799
organicity and the complexity is in

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:15.659
um

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:20.159
is in the overlapping layers

00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:23.400
exactly that we have words you know even

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.559
in this course we chomped it up into

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:27.659
imagination and memory and this and that

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:30.360
but those are just for conveniences

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.140
they're really

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.919
overlapping but I love this word

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:36.720
organicity because it's like the the

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.260
body is the organ of awareness

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.100
um

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.559
uh so what are you aware of when you're

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:45.600
aware that you're aware you're aware of

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.640
the body what the body does

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.860
um

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.419
well it opens into and as awareness

00:25:57.419 --> 00:26:00.539
then there's these modalities that

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:03.559
the identified

00:26:06.179 --> 00:26:09.000
I will say that in my experience

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.940
particularly when I'm doing my pranayama

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.740
practices

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.440
there are oftentimes almost every day

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.179
where the experience of having a

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:20.279
physical body disappears

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:24.740
but the range of flows and their

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.380
interactions I experienced that 24 7.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.539
it's I'm still in a body it's just

00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:32.220
there's some sense of physicality that

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.900
shifts and there's no demarcation line

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.120
there as far as I can tell

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.000
and it may be that I can't have those

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.980
types of experiences of not anybody I

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.380
don't know that but I love the

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.779
experience of not having a body yeah

00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:49.200
okay me too like like

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.179
I mean I don't do it anymore but in my

00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:55.200
recent past if I I get three I get 20 30

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.240
minutes into

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.020
um

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.020
sitting meditation you know conventional

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.080
posture and I'd look for my body and it

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.260
was not there and because there's a lot

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.960
of aches and pains like it's a great

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.840
feeling like literally not being able

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.600
now it's not dissociated I I think this

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.820
you're describing because I feel like

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.539
really here like but

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:24.500
the

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.740
yeah there's no there's no information

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.919
it's like being in uh sleep paralysis or

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.900
something no that's too heavy

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.539
but then it gets can be very Blissful

00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:38.520
because

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.440
um

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.600
there's a lot of information coming in

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.520
from your body that's you know like

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.039
little aches and pains and worries and

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:49.380
this and that or something I don't know

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.299
um so yes I agree with you the the

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:53.460
ability to

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.520
um

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.640
[Music]

00:27:58.039 --> 00:28:01.799
you know yeah there's there's

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:05.220
just that state experience

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.340
um

00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:11.159
I will say that when you talk about the

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:13.080
awareness of awareness the analogy that

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.659
I like to use is that

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:18.120
if I was on the earth and I stepped back

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.940
and I am outside of the earth there's a

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.840
a pace at which the planet is turning

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.240
and that pace is slow enough that it

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.279
feels like Stillness

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:31.140
and it is sort of a sense of awareness

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.240
and then if I stick back into the

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.520
rotation of the planet around the Sun

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.140
that's another

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.779
it's a vastness it I cannot

00:28:41.779 --> 00:28:43.440
name

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.320
but it is like stepping back and then I

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.600
could step back into the

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.260
Galaxy it's like to me there's layers of

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.960
Silence which I cannot

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.200
sense as I am now

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.779
and the closer I am to sensing the more

00:29:00.779 --> 00:29:04.740
likely there is some word might arise to

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:08.000
be spoken from that space

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.919
even though the vast majority of those

00:29:10.919 --> 00:29:13.940
spaces have nothing to say

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.799
is like stepping back stepping back into

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:18.659
Infinity almost

00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:21.840
yeah and for me it's like it's similar

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.020
people so what Justin and I doing we

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.880
just have different ways of Talking to

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.620
Ourselves about things you know it's

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.779
we're not trying to nail down

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:33.659
definitions but for me that makes me

00:29:33.659 --> 00:29:35.700
think of like

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.260
um

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.020
when I'm aware at the perceptual level

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.480
okay the field that is perception let's

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.120
say versus way out in space like you

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.419
were I'm aware that it's a very large

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:52.559
field and I and I can or cannot attend

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.179
to them and when I'm doing awareness

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:55.919
practice I'm just not attending to it

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:59.880
but I'm aware that it's available to me

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:05.520
but aware that these these fields of

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.580
can be made explicate

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:13.080
um but I'm not attending to them so

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.980
uh

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.640
something like that I don't know I mean

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.899
we're saying something similar probably

00:30:21.899 --> 00:30:24.299
something a little different but

00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:26.460
um yeah there are three ranges I am

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.260
sensitive to at the moment and there's

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.659
many that I am not and I just move

00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:33.919
around with them yeah

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:42.840
for me what it was really important is

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.600
the sense of lucidity

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.220
and

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.360
um

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.940
like they say lucid dreaming right it's

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.820
like when you dream and you know you're

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.720
dreaming well what is that quality to me

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.120
the quality of the elusive dream or

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.260
elusive

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.760
non-driven

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.659
uh elicit here is um

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:09.480
is in this sense of Lucidity which is

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.399
kind of

00:31:11.399 --> 00:31:13.020
um

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.880
so for me

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.779
although in the past spaces have played

00:31:18.779 --> 00:31:22.080
a major role Lucidity doesn't seem to be

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.299
space at all like there's no spaceness I

00:31:27.299 --> 00:31:28.860
mean there's spaces

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.299
but

00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:32.360
um

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.880
the Lucidity in itself is so when I was

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.559
looking back

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:39.480
um

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.380
um

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.140
what popped up was memories of loose

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.820
spaces of

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.000
when I felt Lucid

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.760
um and and so

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.399
when I say I felt Lucid that's kind of

00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:56.940
an added quality this Lucidity is there

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.120
in some kind of way or I know it's there

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.279
even when I don't know it's there's

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:03.960
something like that

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.880
um and

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.940
um

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.640
um

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.860
and so there's

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.340
so when I think about awareness it seems

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:17.279
to be it seems to be kind of a almost

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:19.679
like breathing breathing in and out like

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:21.779
Lucy

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:26.940
nothing or whatever is uh not Lucid

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.200
um

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.360
um so

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.659
um and it seems to be the older I get

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:38.640
the more easy it is to Simply Be lucidly

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.480
just remember Neti Neti and etit which

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.500
Nitty Nitty for those who don't know

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.940
but then there is the opposite which is

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.760
it which said this and this and these

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.940
two and these two and these two and

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.840
basically they're kind of

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:01.500
um happening within this Lucidity and

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.419
and

00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:04.200
so

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.559
for me it's the Lucidity basically

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:10.700
awareness and lucidity seem to be

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.419
identical

00:33:12.419 --> 00:33:15.740
as far as I can do

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.220
so

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.679
[Music]

00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:38.700
um

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.899
my dispositional state today is

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:45.899
very sluggish

00:33:45.899 --> 00:33:48.179
and

00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:49.500
um

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.679
and and so I I couldn't help but notice

00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:54.740
I'm usually a pretty

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.399
attentive listener

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:03.360
um but my uh today my ability to be able

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.559
to kind of stay with the instruction was

00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:10.339
there was

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.359
um

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:15.300
it kept being kind of like it's like I

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.220
was there and kind of not there and

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.320
there and kind of not there

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.159
and and what I noticed is there was a

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.320
weird way it was mirroring what you were

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.540
saying about the

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.020
larger

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.839
perceptual field and what we're what

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:37.520
we're actually attending to

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:44.280
at any given moment and

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.399
yeah so that's that's what came up for

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:49.580
me

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.599
so like in in that section on the time

00:35:33.599 --> 00:35:36.200
like

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:41.820
there's two ways you could go you're you

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.220
could go after that instruction you know

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.960
your whole life and then you start

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.240
attending like we did in the memory

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.500
exercise this this or you could just

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.640
zoom out

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.460
and not be interested in any of the

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.740
specifics but have this kind of Gestalt

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.200
of the you know all of that that must

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.520
have happened

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.740
you know you don't even it's kind of

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.960
like stepping back and taking it all in

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.119
without attending to any of the pieces

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:15.839
that you know okay

00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:18.660
oh yeah then I remember that now I'm

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.720
back into like the particular

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.400
um and and

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.460
so for me like AJ said I divided it up

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.339
because we remember the past we imagine

00:36:32.339 --> 00:36:35.040
the future so it followed our I divided

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.839
it up because it followed our course and

00:36:36.839 --> 00:36:38.339
that was kind of cool

00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:40.200
but

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.000
the same with the future you could get

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.800
into all kinds of expectations and

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.200
projections about the future

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.480
so you that's kind of like attending to

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.040
everything that might happen in the

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.260
future or you could just realize that

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:54.839
there's a there's like this whole other

00:36:54.839 --> 00:36:58.140
field that's not yet just like this this

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.440
whole field that was

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.040
and so for me that was kind of what the

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:09.920
exercise was doing for me was

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.720
understanding the backdrop from which

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.880
all these perceptual things happened or

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.880
the memory or the future that's not yet

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.880
that

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.820
there's a vibrancy even the past feels

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.200
like vibrant

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.359
and present

00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:30.540
in that way to me right so my past

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.599
experiences don't seem present but this

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:37.500
whole chunk of reality that I've

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.680
experienced is very present

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.800
as this larger field

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.920
um

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.400
like sometimes you get into that

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.520
kind of reverie when you're on vacation

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.800
with your family or your husband or

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.119
something and you're just sitting there

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:59.160
exhausted and your mind will do that

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.220
like you'll just realize that you all

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.960
the things you went through with this

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.740
person and it comes it comes at you as a

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.359
whole like just

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:12.780
you know you're not tracking

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.040
and so this is like you're just aware of

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.119
this relationship this whole field

00:38:21.119 --> 00:38:23.240
um

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:26.339
so the time part that was how I

00:38:26.339 --> 00:38:28.140
experienced the tiny part

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.980
like you could take it in all as a chunk

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.240
um

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.700
but in order to do that you can't attend

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.119
to

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.140
the instances of it

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.940
would that be like uh doing

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.280
still hunting

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.800
I still

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.460
so there's the chunk is there

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.260
but you're not

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.500
moving your eyes to experience exactly

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.839
it's not what are you looking for you

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:05.220
don't go looking

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.660
it's

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.780
wow what am I looking at like the whole

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.660
thing is just

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.040
yeah very good connection

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.820
sometimes go ahead go

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.880
this connects with an experiment that

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.700
I've been running

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.260
and

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.810
it sort of started with

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:40.440
[Music]

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.660
um

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:47.220
the map not being the territory and this

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.359
shifting from

00:39:50.359 --> 00:39:54.300
allocentric to egocentric

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.660
and then

00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:02.060
seeing what it's like to

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:06.780
see and relate to my grandchildren as my

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:11.220
organs of perception and their

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.619
quality of awareness their

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.780
their relationship with past present and

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.700
future is very different there

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.700
fascination with

00:40:27.359 --> 00:40:31.440
quote reality is very different

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.420
and

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.380
somehow that what we just did is kind of

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:39.359
a mirror of that experience that I've

00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:41.760
been having

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.300
yeah so you know when you come back in

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.339
the fall we have to take the collective

00:40:47.339 --> 00:40:50.460
version of all this and

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.359
um

00:40:51.359 --> 00:40:54.900
so you're aware of all that you're aware

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.240
of and then you're aware of that there's

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.660
all that what they're aware of and all

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.060
that actually constitutes

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.520
the awareness of God but sir like this

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.359
this this whole reality is

00:41:09.359 --> 00:41:11.940
fields of awareness

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.660
um

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.099
and

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:16.880
just like in my own experience I can't

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.320
attend to

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.320
the vastness of any of those fields like

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.000
the perceptual field if you want to keep

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.760
it simple

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.160
there are other Consciousness that you

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.740
are aware of living this awareness but

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.460
you can't attend to your kids

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.619
you can't get inside their brains and

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:39.359
they're you know you can't attend to it

00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:41.940
directly so you can get the sense that

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.140
you share

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.480
you know and it's the same you can get

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.480
like this with the bees and the

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.760
you know once you start thinking like

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.240
that then it's just like

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.119
this you know feel the fields of fields

00:41:57.119 --> 00:42:00.000
of awareness

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.119
um

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.680
yeah

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.720
and then of course each one of those are

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.339
through time also so

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:24.599
and and then I think you know that

00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:25.619
phrase

00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:29.339
as I understand well verbeos is like not

00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:31.740
attending means not grasping

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.740
not wanting to look and

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.839
take a snapshot of it so you'll remember

00:42:36.839 --> 00:42:38.940
or you whatever

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:42.480
so uh

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.140
I'm so sorry that I missed the exercise

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.140
meditation

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.920
um

00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:13.020
and there's so many thoughts that I'm

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.900
having kind of web-like right now

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.319
um one would be to just find out what

00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:21.000
that was like for me to come on and just

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.619
start talking to Bonnie for everyone

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:24.000
because that would have definitely

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.160
brought us into a very particular state

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.800
right of attention

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.319
um no apologization

00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:33.660
um but I'm I'm reflecting back I was on

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.720
another call and um I did some writing

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.099
after

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:40.380
just to try to

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.700
trace and track

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.579
the shifts that I was experiencing in

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:50.040
terms of my attention and I I'm not sure

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.319
I'm using the language correctly so feel

00:43:52.319 --> 00:43:54.780
free to correct me

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.819
um but I was kind of looking at my

00:43:56.819 --> 00:43:59.400
garden and

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.220
um I guess Marie kind of what you were

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.980
saying like I I was getting kind of this

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.579
this it's a tiny little container garden

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:11.460
and it has mint and it has peas and it

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.720
has kale and and yeah and then I was

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.520
just taking in the Gestalt of it right

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.880
and there's a pleasure to me of seeing

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.800
this little world of growing things

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.119
um that my daughter and I have planted

00:44:27.119 --> 00:44:28.500
and

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.900
um and then there was this fly

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.660
that was on Ali

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.300
and I have a history of not liking my

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.460
eyes because I had an infestation and

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:40.200
I've killed many flies

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:40.980
um

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.400
but in this in this moment there was

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.619
something that happened to my visual

00:44:46.619 --> 00:44:50.400
field because of that orchestra's

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.760
quality where it was it was that blue

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.040
silver light reflected in the Sun

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.640
on the background of green and so it was

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.400
this you know I I felt this posture of

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.440
moving towards it this

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.819
um

00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:10.400
yeah

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.980
appreciation yeah

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.980
um and and then I kind of witnessed

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.460
myself coming back and forth from that

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.700
to once again seeing specific leaves

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.920
and the qualities of specific leaves and

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:29.940
then panning out once again so just

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.400
um it was a process of

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:37.560
tracking those perceptual shifts as well

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.119
as the sensorial and internal shifts of

00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:44.280
thought

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.200
um the sensation of where I was sitting

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.220
the question am I doing this right yeah

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.440
no that's great because

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.599
we were talking about this on our walk

00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:58.460
this morning and that is like

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.800
you know when you attend really well oh

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.900
because Jonathan Ralston wrote this book

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.599
uh the matter with things no then that

00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:08.400
moves that matter it's a chess book but

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.960
he says like

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.599
the beauty of Chess is that you get into

00:46:12.599 --> 00:46:14.520
the state where you're concentrating so

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.920
hard you're attending so hard that you

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.440
actually experience freedom

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.839
and it seems like a contradiction and

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:25.079
it's the same like people who are like

00:46:25.079 --> 00:46:27.119
do these little tiny miniature

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:29.160
sculptures and you get completely

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.099
absorbed and you can get absorbed like

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:35.220
that in your garden and you do

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.500
experience freedom and then you do the

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.540
opposite state where you don't attend

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.099
and

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:46.859
you experience let's say spaciousness or

00:46:46.859 --> 00:46:50.700
vastness and somehow I think they're the

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.560
kind of the same thing but we have two

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.200
different modes of it's paradoxical

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.940
because you can understand where you can

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.339
feel spacious if you're not attending

00:46:59.339 --> 00:47:01.740
but it's also true that going in the

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.960
opposite direction

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:07.200
and it gives you a sense of freedom and

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.060
they're different you know we experience

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.280
them differently no one would say you

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.339
get to the exact same experience but we

00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:18.240
use similar words right like so

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.300
um

00:47:20.339 --> 00:47:23.700
so that's that's these this is why it

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.099
was what a contraction I mean like

00:47:26.099 --> 00:47:30.920
it you know they it we just were

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.300
investigating The Human Experience

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.660
really but noticing it is cold right and

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.800
then

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.859
um

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.119
um

00:47:42.119 --> 00:47:45.680
noticing that

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.000
yeah the story that comes up with the

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.280
Flies you know maybe maybe you don't

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.380
want that story to come up so fast every

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.300
time you see a fly and

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.280
and then Wonder like what's what's

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:58.920
really going on here and

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.400
um yeah and

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.640
yeah the in this this notion of your

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.920
dispositional state pre-positions you

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.740
to be closer far or you know so all

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:16.079
these are really the same thing we're

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:18.000
talking about

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.359
um but I love the fact that people

00:48:20.359 --> 00:48:22.980
in this course

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.520
you know are able to use everyday

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.380
experiences every day is called you know

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.540
everyday meditation

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.579
just these normal

00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:34.800
working with your grandchildren or your

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.920
little Garden or yeah

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.220
there's plenty of

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.940
fuel to do all these inquiries in just

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:48.900
in our everyday normal experience

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.000
like your dog behind you

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.260
oh yes

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:57.599
hey so is he a bulldog

00:48:57.599 --> 00:49:01.800
a French Bulldog she's a boxer oh boxer

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.940
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:08.180
very wise

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:11.700
yeah just comment on something Bonnie

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.940
because I've noticed myself over time

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.980
that when I am totally focused on

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.960
something and completely absorbed in it

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.920
like a narrow focus and when there is no

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:25.980
Focus like in the witness State they

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:26.780
both

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.180
exhibit time dilation

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.339
and I think that's fascinating that two

00:49:32.339 --> 00:49:34.200
ends of the specimen the farther in you

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.480
go the

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.880
almost a slower time gets to the point

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.200
where it may stand still in both

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.460
directions I don't know it's pretty

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.500
fascinating to me that's interesting you

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.720
know and as soon as you said that I

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.920
thought aha yes there's time freedom

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.920
and I never really connected with it

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.079
that except as an abstraction

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.640
you know he how he says time Freedom

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.220
Gibson talks about the the new new human

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.440
and we'll have this experience of time

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.940
freedom

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.319
hmm

00:50:07.319 --> 00:50:10.680
yeah you're right it's weird that we we

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.200
conceive of them as and they are like

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.720
two different directions and yet they

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.859
have this common

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.300
timelessness or

00:50:23.579 --> 00:50:25.740
yeah you know what brings to mind is

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.859
another once the sine wave at the crest

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.540
of the trough their experiences are the

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.160
same and in the Middle where I spend

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.160
most of my time it's wide open and

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.660
variable

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:40.460
that's also a great metaphor

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.720
Daniel Ingram will say that these little

00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:04.140
micro rhythms are essentially

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:06.300
the fundamental

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.579
experience of Consciousness you know the

00:51:08.579 --> 00:51:12.780
so these metaphors we use are

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.460
are shared amongst a lot of

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:16.079
practitioners in different ways and then

00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:17.520
they put different words around them but

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.079
yeah

00:51:19.079 --> 00:51:21.420
I'll throw something brand new in it I

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:23.700
just read this week is that

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.220
their gravitational waves going through

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.559
us all the time that they just

00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:30.420
discovered that they thought it was just

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.859
like when

00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:34.140
neutron stars merge or something they

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.940
can measure it but and that's only the

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.099
width of a proton or the hundreds of

00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:39.480
thousands of them with the proton on

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.400
that shift but apparently there's ones

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.599
that are more subtle they're just

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:46.079
pervasive which I find fascinating so

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:48.119
we're being oscillated all over this

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:50.420
place

00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:59.040
but I'm keep returning to is

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.099
the metaphors from the very beginning of

00:52:02.099 --> 00:52:03.480
the course

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.660
we were made aware of metaphors in it

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:09.720
using them and I've been writing stories

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.780
where metaphors actually start to have

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.240
their own life

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:20.760
Horizon and so on and um

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.300
what I keep noticing in

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.300
the way I'm thinking about reality and

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.780
awareness and the fundamentals

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:33.359
um like a friend of mine just always

00:52:33.359 --> 00:52:36.420
used to say oh it's fundamental

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:41.099
but um anyways so so there is you know

00:52:41.099 --> 00:52:44.520
there's all these metaphors and

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:45.900
there's

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:50.000
as far as I can see

00:52:50.099 --> 00:52:50.940
um

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.619
no way out of metaphors

00:52:54.619 --> 00:52:57.540
it is as if we're

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.099
continually

00:52:59.099 --> 00:53:01.740
kind of it like

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.059
one thing makes us think of the other

00:53:05.059 --> 00:53:07.619
because they are metaphorically

00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:08.940
connected

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.619
so there is a kind of a

00:53:13.319 --> 00:53:14.720
um

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.579
this and there's fundamental metaphors

00:53:17.579 --> 00:53:19.859
that are different for different people

00:53:19.859 --> 00:53:23.900
somehow fundamental in the sense that

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:27.839
this metaphors speak to them very deeply

00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:31.619
very strongly and get filled up with

00:53:31.619 --> 00:53:35.220
life like truth was a metaphor that was

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.220
filled up with tons and tons and tons of

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:42.599
things until I discovered that there is

00:53:42.599 --> 00:53:44.819
no truth

00:53:44.819 --> 00:53:48.720
or truth is a metaphor and and so

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.020
um as we're speaking I'm very much aware

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:55.040
of these metaphors

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.680
yeah so

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.700
a metaphor is basically a relationship

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:08.339
and everything else about existence is

00:54:08.339 --> 00:54:12.800
relationship right so so

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.460
if you cut

00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.319
the cut you know if you cut metaphors

00:54:19.319 --> 00:54:20.819
all the way down you'd have nothing

00:54:20.819 --> 00:54:23.640
because a medical is just a relationship

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.119
a relationship between this and that

00:54:27.119 --> 00:54:29.240
um

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.460
yeah and in terms of truth you're right

00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:38.220
it's it's it's true you know

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.280
um yeah everybody that's arguing for

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:43.500
truth is arguing from a certain mental

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.859
model like truth as a container or you

00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:49.859
know or truth as

00:54:49.859 --> 00:54:53.280
whatever you know truth does evidence or

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.260
truth and these are all metaphors and

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:57.500
then

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.380
uh

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.079
seems there's no outside to it

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.660
exactly are you

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.819
you're like in sight and yet

00:55:29.819 --> 00:55:34.040
it's so obviously a metaphor

00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:42.119
and what I'm saying is that metaphors

00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:45.359
are metaphors for

00:55:45.359 --> 00:55:48.599
concrete the way things actually happen

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:50.940
concretely

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.940
um

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:55.640
yeah

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.780
there are so many metaphors that are

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.460
those body

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:07.140
metaphors or bearing weights or

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.740
having empty hands or full heart right

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.940
it's

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:13.920
there's a

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.079
um

00:56:16.079 --> 00:56:19.859
there's also a truth that can come in

00:56:19.859 --> 00:56:25.160
quieting into some kind of deep place

00:56:25.339 --> 00:56:27.900
recognition sort of

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.440
foreign

00:57:39.059 --> 00:57:42.420
they can't do these large leaps

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.040
um

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.319
um I was talking to madelina and I was

00:57:46.319 --> 00:57:48.359
on mute madalina hi I know you had a

00:57:48.359 --> 00:57:50.940
question the other day and we actually

00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:52.859
didn't get a chance to go back to it it

00:57:52.859 --> 00:57:54.420
was about something I wrote

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:58.920
uh so yes yeah I'm I'm sorry I'm I was

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:03.119
late no top of the hour is good please

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:06.960
well you know it's called the clutch

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.300
guide

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:14.780
oh that's and that's not a metaphor

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.119
anyway

00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:21.780
um yeah I mean I have to bring up the

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:25.200
text but I think it had something to do

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.079
well there's been actually twice with

00:58:28.079 --> 00:58:30.900
you in a very significant way that I

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.880
have felt this relief

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.559
at

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:35.579
um

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:38.599
you know a way that something is

00:58:38.599 --> 00:58:43.260
articulated I mean one was

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.980
I'm still very much metabolizing which

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.040
you said something along the lines of

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:54.059
you know that if if nothing else you

00:58:54.059 --> 00:58:57.299
know how wonderful it is to just

00:58:57.299 --> 00:59:01.079
become extinct with all the others you

00:59:01.079 --> 00:59:03.059
know all all the human right right

00:59:03.059 --> 00:59:06.540
something hopeful than that no no no but

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:09.660
I'm I'm really serious about that I I I

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.799
mean serious not in like um joking but I

00:59:13.799 --> 00:59:16.200
think there's I'm I'm responding from

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.240
how I'm not going to say my body because

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.760
I'm also getting sick of that but I

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.760
don't know what else to say

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.140
[Laughter]

00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.880
you know

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.799
um the the

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:32.579
I don't know if organism helps you know

00:59:32.579 --> 00:59:35.599
because we are yeah

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:38.220
where do you land on that well I

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:39.559
searched

00:59:39.559 --> 00:59:42.780
in terms of Extinction

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:46.099
Extinction and organism

00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:49.140
rat organism rather than

00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:50.660
than

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.760
bodies I mean I know you did you say

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.099
bodies in space and I I like that

00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:58.619
because that's already putting it in

00:59:58.619 --> 01:00:00.780
to this

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.680
space thing but organism versus

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:08.400
well body the the the the useful thing

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.599
about using body is

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.319
you know okay and it's an interesting

01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:18.480
question are they

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.940
or you could you know you could start to

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.380
see

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.700
um

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.740
yeah so at a certain level uh organism

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.319
is useful and that is to show the

01:00:31.319 --> 01:00:33.359
continuity between human life and other

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.920
organisms

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.960
and then at a certain level you might

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.180
say Well they're

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.940
they're just bodies and then it gets

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:43.740
complicated people will say but a planet

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.200
is not Auto politically closed blah blah

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.180
blah blah and there's all this stuff but

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.299
I use the term body to

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:55.260
um make the switch into like

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.799
like asteroids and stars in the sun like

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.900
those kind of bodies too we call them

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.079
planetary bodies or you know

01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:06.599
um yeah that that's helpful that it's

01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:10.799
not just because I like the idea of like

01:01:10.799 --> 01:01:13.319
the question of how does an organism

01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:15.299
learn how to evolve

01:01:15.299 --> 01:01:17.940
that's a question right

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.819
I think bodies are even simpler and

01:01:20.819 --> 01:01:24.200
lower down the stack let's say and yeah

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:28.040
especially if you like

01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:34.319
you know some of these things like when

01:01:34.319 --> 01:01:37.200
people walk into a room

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.119
yeah you're an organism but you're not

01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:42.299
really you don't even have to like

01:01:42.299 --> 01:01:44.700
do anything you just have to be like a

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.799
physical body in that space and it'll

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:49.440
change things you know so I just just

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.880
like

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.140
um

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.140
some people here that have been in my

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.059
course workshops I'll just keep saying

01:01:57.059 --> 01:02:00.599
bodies in space so you just try to

01:02:00.599 --> 01:02:02.700
experience what's happening it's just

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.920
bodies moving in space and you get a

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.900
very interesting

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.819
um it's much more simpler and

01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:10.319
fundamental

01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.880
but

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.099
um I wouldn't use that term

01:02:14.099 --> 01:02:16.680
in every every

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.540
contest yeah

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:22.319
okay I found it it was

01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:25.619
um that we are tied together by one

01:02:25.619 --> 01:02:27.059
causal

01:02:27.059 --> 01:02:31.140
umbilicus that can never be cut

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.319
it's not a law of equal and opposite

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.599
it's the law of causal

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:43.440
interpenetration

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.839
and because of you and you're the cause

01:02:45.839 --> 01:02:50.839
of me we are the effects of each other

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:54.660
you know I mean this this this hit me in

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.299
this other way I'm not going to try to

01:02:57.299 --> 01:03:01.880
analyze it or you know

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.880
but it was interrupted by the no

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.180
distance

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.140
meaning the effect of it which I'm going

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:14.420
to continue

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.900
to sort of work with

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.420
um which is kind of what I've done with

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.960
all your texts honestly is really try to

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.799
let them work knee I mean like this is

01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:33.859
almost how I've tried like to

01:03:33.859 --> 01:03:37.799
be with with the the writing you know

01:03:37.799 --> 01:03:40.380
yeah this stuff works me you know like

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.200
half the time I was reading my before

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.599
Socrates again the other day and and

01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:48.240
because I've had enough space and and

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.880
I've I read them like I like it doesn't

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.440
seem like I wrote them and I was like

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.420
crying I was like

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.220
and then I was like oh I wrote that

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.299
you're like

01:03:57.299 --> 01:04:01.140
yeah oh I I I I I can see how that would

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:03.540
happen honestly so I think there's some

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.339
deep meaning there you know but like you

01:04:05.339 --> 01:04:08.220
said I don't unpack it either I just I

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.240
just

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.299
get into these these ways of trying to

01:04:12.299 --> 01:04:14.400
express something that is

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.460
very lucid I use motion like there's a

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.460
Lucidity yes that's needing to be

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.579
articulated and

01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.700
um

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.660
yeah

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.940
and then sometimes I read it afterwards

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.619
and I'm in the same state like that's

01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:34.020
really interesting and then my mind

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.900
starts understanding like all the things

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.599
that it could mean

01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:40.859
um

01:04:40.859 --> 01:04:45.000
it was so many yeah oh well then that

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.920
ones that was on like

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.240
it was like on our concept of

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.680
intersubjectivity it's more like you're

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.900
over here I'm over here we're talking to

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.000
each other and somehow we can come to

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
the truth right versus

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.839
were actually

01:05:02.839 --> 01:05:06.240
together at a common umbilicus

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.819
and

01:05:08.819 --> 01:05:11.099
and we should

01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:13.200
we should enjoy the diversity of

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.079
opinions but you're never gonna it you

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.940
know even if you come to agree here you

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.980
got a gap in between right and that

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.119
you're actually

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:24.740
and so for me it's like

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:27.240
like I don't think

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.040
I think it was Aftershock and he said

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.240
must have been complaining about John

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.299
bravicki that philosophy and Truth is

01:05:33.299 --> 01:05:35.880
dialogical in that sense

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.859
I think

01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:40.140
um we're connected at these deeper

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.280
levels

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.079
and then

01:05:43.079 --> 01:05:46.500
when we then we sing together

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.339
um

01:05:47.339 --> 01:05:51.780
um and as a single body as Walt Whitman

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.680
said we we

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:58.200
are composed of many contradictions as a

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.240
human species let's say we're a single

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.839
body what did he say I include I include

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:07.460
many kinds I can I can change

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.700
multitudes okay exactly

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.420
so

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.700
um so

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:21.240
well one yeah one thing I wanted to ask

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.880
you in relation to the umbilicus

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.940
is that for a while I've been playing

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.400
around with this notion

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.799
um that before

01:06:31.799 --> 01:06:34.319
being humans you know obviously we're

01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:37.500
mammals but that that the mammal of

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.960
Distinction is that we're all uterines

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:47.160
and that that gestation and

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.980
um is obviously different than if we

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:54.180
were in eggs you know outside

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:58.020
um like chicken latex which which is

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:01.260
what everything was until whatever this

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:02.760
particular

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.799
Evolution

01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:07.559
um which now you're saying was a virus

01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:10.200
on the reptile and you know whatever

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.119
some speculation

01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:14.819
but it has this amazing thing which is

01:07:14.819 --> 01:07:17.640
the placenta

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:21.059
which is a temporary organ without which

01:07:21.059 --> 01:07:25.380
the host body would kill

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.980
you know yeah so the the mammalian

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.559
reproductive system is very

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.319
it's these Mysteries these things that

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:38.819
you if they weren't real you couldn't

01:07:38.819 --> 01:07:43.160
even imagine them like like

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:47.819
the human uh the the female reproductive

01:07:47.819 --> 01:07:50.160
system is like a it's like a capsule

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.859
inside that yourself it doesn't attach

01:07:52.859 --> 01:07:55.140
everything else is attached from your

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.660
mouth to your anus

01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.059
but this thing is not attached from your

01:08:00.059 --> 01:08:02.819
mouth your anus it does it's like a it's

01:08:02.819 --> 01:08:04.980
set up to be like a time capsule or

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.839
something

01:08:06.839 --> 01:08:09.299
you know and

01:08:09.299 --> 01:08:10.160
um

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.380
it's also why theoretically and they you

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.460
know they can grow fetuses in in

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.259
artificial wounds now because literally

01:08:19.259 --> 01:08:21.480
that's how

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.500
That's How uh

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.900
yeah it makes you think like aliens came

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:31.140
down and put some containers in mammals

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.960
and and

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.699
then forced us to reproduce them or

01:08:35.699 --> 01:08:37.080
something you know what I mean this is

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:42.779
it's weird that how how autonomous the

01:08:42.779 --> 01:08:45.060
reproductive system is to the rest of

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.759
the body you can't take your heart out

01:08:47.759 --> 01:08:49.920
you can't take your lungs out you could

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.020
take all your reproductive systems out

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.179
you're not going to die it's it's there

01:08:54.179 --> 01:08:56.400
to serve something else something other

01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.779
than you

01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:01.739
and that's where those Facts of Life

01:09:01.739 --> 01:09:04.980
okay which you know there's been massive

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:08.100
debate over the years there's medieval

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.719
you know scientists drawing a whole

01:09:11.719 --> 01:09:14.699
hamuko inside the sperm because the

01:09:14.699 --> 01:09:17.160
woman couldn't have anything to do with

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.440
whatever else happened it was just a

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:22.400
host you know whatever yeah

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.560
Facts of Life I mean as how we're

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.859
gestated that even if they end up

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:32.279
migrating somewhere else for now at

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:35.660
least there's a period of intense

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.719
exchange you know between with this

01:09:39.719 --> 01:09:42.000
placenta mediator

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.359
which is crucial There's Something About

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:49.640
This us all being uterines

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.100
that to me speaks to this Unity this

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:57.860
prior Unity from which you can you know

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.080
differentiate endlessly you know but

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.120
it's not like you're looking for the

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.160
unity you're not looking for the partner

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.140
who's going to be the other half of the

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:09.420
orange or whatever you know it's like

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:12.600
we're already part of that unity and I

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.960
think you've talked to this in very

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.840
different ways but you went to umbilicus

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.620
you know and I sort of like went into

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.280
this uterine thing you know because it's

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.460
true for all mammals for now and that's

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.580
good enough yeah and it's also like all

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.920
life on Earth is attached to the sun

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.719
through an umbilicus

01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:38.940
it just doesn't have to be it's not like

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.300
a physical chord but if if but it feeds

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.560
often from the Sun in the same way

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.020
the the fetus feeds off the bloodstream

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.340
of the

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:53.520
the the mother there is it's a it's

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.500
clearly an umbilical relationship

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.320
between the Earth and the Sun and

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.780
there's a great a video on verastrum

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.820
like what do we actually what is entropy

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.500
but he he asked his questions what does

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.920
the Earth actually get from the Sun

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.020
and

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:13.920
um so basically it's energy I'll post it

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.239
when I when I uh post the the link when

01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:21.840
I uh upload this video but then he says

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.360
okay so the Earth receives energy from

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:26.820
the Sun Sun how much energy does the

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.719
Earth radiate back

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:33.480
it turns out 100 100 of what it receives

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:36.179
it radiates back and then he goes

01:11:36.179 --> 01:11:37.980
through why that's the case because of

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.460
us the Earth would just burn up and die

01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:44.699
and and all living things on Earth are

01:11:44.699 --> 01:11:49.100
part of taking that energy and

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.340
transforming it so that when it goes out

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.400
the other side it's no longer heat it's

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.340
not usable energy and so life on the

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.280
earth is the transduction of energy from

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.760
the from the complex energies when we

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.560
get it from the sun it's in a complex

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.640
state

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.500
to dissipating it as entropy and this is

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.199
and this is the umbilical relationship

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:18.719
between the Sun and the Earth and then

01:12:18.719 --> 01:12:20.400
he asks well how did the Sun get all

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.380
that organized energy in the first place

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.199
and that's its relationship

01:12:25.199 --> 01:12:28.080
in its Journey like it's just

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.040
it's just

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.420
so that's what I mean by umbilical is

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:38.120
too it goes like it goes like that also

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.600
yeah

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.320
foreign

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:56.400
like the uterine Society or like like

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.640
yeah I've been testing it in different

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:03.300
places just because it has a kind of

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.100
um I think potential to

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:11.659
get underneath all these other

01:13:11.659 --> 01:13:15.060
hierarchies and classifications but it

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.250
still sort of has a kind of

01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:17.580
[Music]

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.860
um

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:23.340
and we need the own Factor yeah it

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.500
should be like at the end of my chapter

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.500
who are we at these people assembled at

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.560
the end of the world we are the uterine

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:35.060
uterine yes yes

01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:42.540
no we're we're talking about

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.640
um I think

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:50.100
um so much of what we're doing together

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.679
is even

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:55.020
something that really we have to

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.500
recognize has not been done before it

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.460
hasn't been possible to do this

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:07.440
right here in the zoom call with people

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.580
really I mean I see all the people that

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.640
already know you from before that I mean

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.760
there's there's tremendous

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:20.940
you know engagement here and it's

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:23.580
completely indeterminate

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:29.540
there's no certification there's no

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.920
no but I mean this is extraordinary and

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.659
I think again from an evolutionary

01:14:36.659 --> 01:14:39.900
standpoint this has got to

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.520
have

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.679
a kind of

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:44.520
um

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.739
at least engages with tremendous

01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:51.060
curiosity yeah I mean the fact that

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.400
like I always say this is true I mean

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.500
the people that come here even people

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.520
who can only come you know not regularly

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.400
like a very high functioning like the

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.620
ability to take in these kinds of

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.560
practices and conversations

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.340
um

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.320
if you take the whole course it's quite

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.120
rigorous you know you have to go slow

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.040
and you have to be patient and you have

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:14.900
to be

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.060
uh disciplined

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:24.060
um but you wouldn't see this in

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.760
a structure that says loosely held as

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.500
the pop-up School you wouldn't you

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.179
wouldn't be able to

01:15:30.179 --> 01:15:31.739
see this and

01:15:31.739 --> 01:15:33.780
you know because there's there's much

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.940
more high functioning in the

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.300
in the normal culture and part of it is

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.800
because

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.860
um you know everyone on these calls has

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:45.840
read Around you've read around this

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.760
you've read a little that we got Justin

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:51.659
his emails a lot about physics and you

01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:54.719
know there's so much metaphor we could

01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:58.020
even say there's so much metaphorical

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.460
uh

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:03.719
content that can be hybridized and

01:16:03.719 --> 01:16:07.860
um and uh then the ability to pay

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.520
attention to your experience and

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:15.060
and then have a good dialogue so these

01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.400
are skills that I think

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.659
um

01:16:18.659 --> 01:16:21.300
that humans have had before but you'd

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.739
usually see them in like uh Jesuit

01:16:24.739 --> 01:16:27.960
communities or something you know

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.540
um in these small places

01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:32.640
um I've been there I've been there

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.940
believe me it's not quite like this yeah

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.940
maybe years ago

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:43.260
um but yeah I mean even the religious

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.320
communities aren't you know like they

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.340
were but

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.960
I think

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.420
um but there's still a smell

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.420
for me yeah what I was about monastic

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:57.120
last week it was a big

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.659
big argument between the pedagogy for

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:02.040
the new human they were talking about

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.420
the new human homo

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:10.739
Amore was a new human okay

01:17:10.739 --> 01:17:12.780
and

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:15.300
what was on the table was this whole

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.120
lineage monastic lineage

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.159
and you know I was looking at the kids

01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:22.860
at the monastery and I'm like what is

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.860
what is the chance I took a gabster

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.719
approach you know like they were taking

01:17:27.719 --> 01:17:29.640
like a monastic lineage and everybody

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.320
who had to developed this you had to

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.280
have teacher really Authority and all

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.679
that okay I get that but then I said if

01:17:34.679 --> 01:17:37.440
it's truly radical it's got to be latent

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.420
in this system right now and I was

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.040
pointing to the kids which are really

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.540
great at the monastery and I'm like look

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.699
at look who's they were all starting to

01:17:44.699 --> 01:17:45.900
stand up

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.420
and be like they wanted to be recognized

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:50.760
I'm like it's got to be latent in the

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.040
system now so maybe our job is just to

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.620
reflect that back you know

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:59.699
and it was a huge brouhaha

01:17:59.699 --> 01:18:03.199
um and and

01:18:03.239 --> 01:18:05.420
um

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.699
yeah

01:18:08.699 --> 01:18:10.980
it got pretty it was pretty hot to

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:12.600
handle but

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.719
um

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.980
that's I think the difference here is

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.940
just

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:21.980
it's got to be already in the system

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.400
well since you gave me a little segue

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.199
when you talked about what does the sun

01:18:28.199 --> 01:18:30.239
give the earth I thought well how does a

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:32.100
star form you get cosmic dust and

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.659
there's a certain amount of gravity and

01:18:33.659 --> 01:18:37.080
pressure and it ignites and it made me

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.340
think of this thought that I've had

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:40.739
before is it on the one end you have

01:18:40.739 --> 01:18:43.320
photons which have no Mass so experience

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.580
no time

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:46.500
and then you have

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.679
a singularity of black hole which is

01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:51.840
infinitely dense it's completely the

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.540
opposite where there's almost no time

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:57.360
because apparently it if you could

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.120
survive it as you were falling into the

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.860
Event Horizon of black hole you would

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.480
watch the entire future of the universe

01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:06.179
pass before you rise time slows down

01:19:06.179 --> 01:19:08.760
that much so you have infinite density

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.300
where time virtually stops and no

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.560
density

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.659
in a photon where there is no time

01:19:15.659 --> 01:19:17.400
period

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.320
I just find that fascinating between

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.260
those two opposite ends of the spectrum

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:24.000
again

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.920
but the black hole

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:31.739
all the time right right but the black

01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:32.760
hole

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:36.239
all of town is simultaneous right

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:38.640
it's it's different than having no time

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.179
yeah yeah okay

01:19:42.179 --> 01:19:45.780
it's different but the quality yes like

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.360
those two things yeah I know like

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.159
focused it's almost like the black holes

01:19:50.159 --> 01:19:53.340
focused attention and the photons of no

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.020
attention

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:57.000
so that might make the black hole the

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.440
most conscious thing in the universe I'm

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.600
not sure about that but it's an

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.679
interesting

01:20:01.679 --> 01:20:03.480
notion

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.920
or most attentive yeah yeah right right

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.260
the deepest well you know this is this

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:13.800
is what uh White had said and it's all

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.719
it's the notion of duration and all

01:20:15.719 --> 01:20:19.159
process philosophy so

01:20:19.739 --> 01:20:20.340
um

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.100
so like when we were holding awareness

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.020
open without attending

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:28.440
so there's that that notion of the like

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.380
the moment

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.860
like times time doesn't pass until you

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.659
go from one point of attention to

01:20:36.659 --> 01:20:38.219
another point of attention and then

01:20:38.219 --> 01:20:41.280
that's time so if you could open your

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.199
duration

01:20:43.199 --> 01:20:46.860
and then like God has Eternal duration

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:49.260
so it's like the black hole he's aware

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.440
of everything all at once simultaneously

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:53.960
because

01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:59.640
it doesn't attend he's just that

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:02.040
um and then you could think of

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:02.699
um

01:21:02.699 --> 01:21:04.739
different entities having different

01:21:04.739 --> 01:21:06.719
durations like

01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:09.300
um the oscillation of electron would be

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.840
its duration and these wave like things

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.120
that meditators would be a duration of

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.780
what is possible to be to be open to and

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.940
stuff like that it's a you know all

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:24.060
these things there there's like

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.460
in our Collective imagination and

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.460
understanding and experiences there's a

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:33.960
lot of convergence going on in in

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.239
like the meditate like it's amazing that

01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:39.020
Michael Levin who's this physicist

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.239
he's talking to people who Who present

01:21:42.239 --> 01:21:44.340
at science and non-duality because

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.800
they're sensing a convergence of our

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.440
Collective imagination

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.260
um it's really fascinating

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:54.239
um

01:21:54.239 --> 01:21:56.400
and then even years ago when I first

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.960
started teaching The Graduate Institute

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.239
there was this movement happening but it

01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:02.699
was too new aging people were like you

01:22:02.699 --> 01:22:05.400
know watching what the bleep what to

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.020
believe do we know and thinking that

01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.580
they could use their minds and walk

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:11.760
through walls right like very but but

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.540
this is real stuff like in terms of

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.199
hybridization of ideas

01:22:18.659 --> 01:22:20.340
well I

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.860
in my own way of seeing things it does

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:26.280
seem like playing with the ideas begins

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.320
to resonate my body with the space from

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:32.360
which the audience came from yeah

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.239
all these perspective reversals are also

01:22:36.239 --> 01:22:39.179
very generative of complete new ways of

01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:40.860
understanding reality

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.440
like seeing us as uterines or just like

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.840
you say I don't I'm experiencing that

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.820
ideas but the space that the eye these

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.280
are all uh they're not simple

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.500
perspectives they're what I call Vantage

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.940
Point shifts and this is actually what

01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:58.800
needs to happen

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:00.480
um

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.699
before something completely new to

01:23:02.699 --> 01:23:04.679
happen you know like these bands these

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:06.480
huge

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.400
Vantage Point shifts like in my my my

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.380
is it toast article when I I talked

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:15.480
about being stuck on a planet hanging

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.360
upside down you know like chat jvt

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.880
couldn't figure couldn't figure that out

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.699
that was absolutely I haven't read that

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:27.480
yet fantastic fantastic

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.820
I don't know if anybody's checked out

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.239
this Sarah Walker and we Cronin and

01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:35.600
their time is an object

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.340
I have one of your books

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.159
oh what do you think of um I haven't

01:23:41.159 --> 01:23:42.659
really read it yet it's got a lot of

01:23:42.659 --> 01:23:44.780
math

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.699
well I mean they had a conversation with

01:23:47.699 --> 01:23:48.719
Jim Wright

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:51.300
um that

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.960
again I I couldn't report yeah there's

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.900
it's interesting there's a lot of uh

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.540
what's his name

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.699
um a lot of people philosophers and

01:24:02.699 --> 01:24:04.800
physicists have been re trying to

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.580
reconstruct re conceptualize time

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:12.300
for for a long time so

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.280
I do have one of their books I think

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.219
it's a company uh volume of other

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:20.820
editors but I haven't read it yet so

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:23.520
well the conversation with Jim Rudd

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.420
again because I think part of this media

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:29.640
of conversation which I don't call it

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.460
I don't call it dialogic I mean I think

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:34.860
conversation is a beautiful word I mean

01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:36.659
it's to turn

01:24:36.659 --> 01:24:40.500
you know and to towards something so it

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:45.300
I feel that heliotropic thing if the

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.060
conversation draws me in then it's you

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:50.100
know that's enough

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:52.500
um and the conversation is

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:57.239
is pretty uh animated and

01:24:57.239 --> 01:25:00.500
um anyway I'd be curious to hear

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.659
especially how you yeah

01:25:03.659 --> 01:25:05.540
um

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:09.840
see it because of the materiality of it

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:14.820
I I found that pretty powerful

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:18.120
it seems to dovetail nicely with

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:21.239
some of this work yeah

01:25:21.239 --> 01:25:24.300
of the Mind back and body body back in

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.780
nature but then you know nature back in

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:31.440
time or something like that you know

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.080
because you can't stop at the nature I

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.179
think I mean even though that's sort of

01:25:36.179 --> 01:25:39.239
everything and where everything's from

01:25:39.239 --> 01:25:42.360
um but I don't know if we're capable of

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.659
doing that without sort of

01:25:45.659 --> 01:25:48.719
not stopping there somehow I don't know

01:25:48.719 --> 01:25:52.679
what I'm saying but yeah I mean we could

01:25:52.679 --> 01:25:53.600
use

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.920
you could just go right through our

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:58.980
course is time it you know there's a

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.500
time that kind of time that is felt in

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.500
the body like there are there are time

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:08.100
clocks yourselves and your Baseline

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.320
Global oscillations of your brain

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.679
they're all running time your heart beat

01:26:13.679 --> 01:26:15.300
all these

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.219
um are time Keepers for different

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:18.840
processes in your body and then you

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.460
could say well it's time

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:23.460
In My Memory like is it the construction

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.980
of my memory or it's time something I

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.280
imagine is time of pure abstraction

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.639
um is what it if times appear you know

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.219
all these

01:26:34.219 --> 01:26:37.199
these these are all different kinds we

01:26:37.199 --> 01:26:40.440
have just one more time

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.560
and I think that that

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:45.120
um

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.340
yeah I think that there's and then you

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.500
have the experience of time which is

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.260
plastic as Justin was saying

01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:56.520
um and so I think that

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.739
I think our language is not helpful here

01:26:58.739 --> 01:27:01.260
because maybe there's more things going

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:04.080
on than just this word time I mean we

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.679
have this one word time and then we like

01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:09.060
and so maybe

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:11.159
Maybe

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:14.280
that's one of the problems maybe there

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.320
there we use the same word for different

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:19.380
elements of reality I don't know you

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:20.820
know

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.280
um and the fact that we just use the

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:27.120
same word makes us feel like

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.060
they're different aspects to the same

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.340
thing but maybe it's not maybe

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.380
maybe there's something else going on I

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.620
don't know

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.300
I just remembering that you know I did a

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.040
fair number of hallucinogens in my

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.860
younger days late 60s early 70s and

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:45.840
there's no doubt in my mind whatsoever

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.179
that hallucinogens alter the rate at

01:27:48.179 --> 01:27:50.040
which time it's passing for you

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.460
and um I think that's probably part of

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:56.159
their benefit because they loosen up the

01:27:56.159 --> 01:27:58.679
space that holds your Notions so that

01:27:58.679 --> 01:28:00.360
you're working you know you're operating

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.760
in a different frame rate which loosens

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.320
up the way you have held things together

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.260
I at least I felt it was it led me to

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:10.260
yoga back then yeah I consider it

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.600
extremely useful although I have not

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.920
done it since then

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.340
yeah yeah and you can start I mean a lot

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.139
of

01:28:18.139 --> 01:28:20.100
what

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.219
meditation is is it opens up so you can

01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:25.860
start to you have enough bandwidth to

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:30.840
see things happening and and I mean you

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.179
can even feel

01:28:33.179 --> 01:28:36.239
like how your hands work like

01:28:36.239 --> 01:28:38.340
you know what I'm looking I I remember

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:41.520
holding a banana and thinking it was the

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.500
most marvelous thing because I didn't

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.320
crush the banana nor did it Bob and I

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.840
could feel the perfect Scenic like

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.120
I just thought it was the most marvelous

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.000
thing you know like

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:54.600
um

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.540
and you can really almost feel

01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:01.679
yourselves and you can uh you can you

01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:04.679
can explore the thought things that are

01:29:04.679 --> 01:29:07.739
thoughts not thoughts themselves but

01:29:07.739 --> 01:29:10.320
you get you get

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.739
you get to see what thought things are

01:29:13.739 --> 01:29:14.760
um

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.580
and all these things are I think you're

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:21.000
right they come from the fact that

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.520
experience slows down or time opens up

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:24.900
whatever

01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:27.300
you want to explain it

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.860
you're reminding me of something when I

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.840
started doing yoga one of the things I

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.780
recognized was that

01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:36.239
thoughts are always at least as I

01:29:36.239 --> 01:29:38.699
experience associated with a particular

01:29:38.699 --> 01:29:41.760
frequency a particular motion and the

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.380
moment that I could separate those two

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.480
the words vanish as if they couldn't

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.420
exist unless they were tied to that

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:51.540
Sensational experience yes so this is

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:54.120
exactly

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.980
um thoughts are movements they're

01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:59.880
they're and their micro movements of

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.100
your body and then their movements of

01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:05.400
glial cells and they're actually

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.840
movement

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.560
I mean

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.080
yeah

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.940
it's something the body does

01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.739
I I wonder

01:30:16.739 --> 01:30:19.500
um about the relationship between change

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.060
and time

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:25.199
right so I have a teenage boy and

01:30:25.199 --> 01:30:28.920
um he grew like eight inches in a year

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.199
he went from being shorter than me to be

01:30:31.199 --> 01:30:33.659
much taller than me

01:30:33.659 --> 01:30:36.000
um so that the change everyone's talked

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.179
about oh how drastically that change

01:30:39.179 --> 01:30:41.760
happened and how that is reflected that

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.179
the passing of time the developmental

01:30:45.179 --> 01:30:46.620
process

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:49.199
and then there's also this quality of

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:51.840
going when when I live by the ocean when

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.000
I go to the ocean when I sit near it

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.520
when I'm in in the presence

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.500
of the water

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.000
it's like

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.800
Ancient Ancient room going back to the

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:11.400
womb idea and time pans out so

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.960
far

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.840
um

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:18.179
within that developmental progression

01:31:18.179 --> 01:31:20.940
that I've witnessed to in that moment

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:23.340
um and so and yeah in both of those

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:27.600
cases it's like a quality of change or

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.620
um

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.960
and then and then the black hole being

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.060
something like is there

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:35.520
is there change happening in that or is

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.860
that a space where

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:41.699
there there isn't change until it is I

01:31:41.699 --> 01:31:42.659
don't know

01:31:42.659 --> 01:31:44.699
well you you know

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:47.580
yeah so your son growing up going really

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:50.280
fast that's a biological time box right

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.320
we have different but this is a question

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.520
about Justin like a black hole

01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.659
is a black hole a whole

01:32:00.659 --> 01:32:02.219
hey

01:32:02.219 --> 01:32:06.120
or it's got It's got a huge amount of

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.920
mass right

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:11.040
so the fact that we call it a whole

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:13.620
is only because the way things swirl

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.120
around it and then

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.120
light or whatever can't get away from it

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.719
okay so yeah so the blood you know a

01:32:21.719 --> 01:32:24.420
hole is empty of something and a black

01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:30.739
hole is like the most concentrated Mass

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.219
hmm I think it's complicated there

01:32:35.219 --> 01:32:37.560
because originally they thought that you

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.300
can't lose information some information

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.840
was going into the black hole and stays

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.239
there and apparently Hawking radiation

01:32:45.239 --> 01:32:46.920
that's coming out it's actually losing

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.900
some of it so I mean nobody knows what's

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.940
going on inside of a black hole right

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.639
but only that light can't escape because

01:32:53.639 --> 01:32:55.679
of the gravity that's it that's what

01:32:55.679 --> 01:32:57.600
makes it black yeah

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.280
and uh

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.980
what Consciousness is doing in there

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.139
fascinates me and I

01:33:04.139 --> 01:33:06.360
I still I don't dwell on it much but it

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:08.600
comes to mind every once in a while

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:10.679
okay I know this has something to do

01:33:10.679 --> 01:33:13.320
relatively why can't my escape a black

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:16.440
hole if it has no Mass

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:19.080
that's a really good point because it

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:22.260
shouldn't be affected by Mass

01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.560
exactly yeah

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:27.780
something happens at this at the at

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.719
these speeds there there is a thing for

01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:34.620
relativity they get there's a workaround

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.840
well the shredded stars are going in

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.040
there and they're maybe they're still

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.780
radiating light but it's the particles

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:41.699
the stars were made from maybe that's

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:43.920
being sucked in that's possible

01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:46.980
I don't know no I don't either I never

01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:48.120
thought about that so it's interesting

01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.780
but you know on the other hand if the

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:54.000
Big Bang Theory is right and I'm not

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.940
saying that it is but the gravity and

01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:00.300
the density came before photons

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:02.760
so that existed first so I don't know if

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:03.719
that

01:34:03.719 --> 01:34:05.460
I mean I don't even think photons

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.500
photons were one of the first Parts I

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:10.260
think Clarkson electrons maybe I don't

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.060
remember some plasma with that stuff in

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:13.920
it but I don't think photons were

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.500
exactly first though I you know

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.900
it interests me and there's no answer

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:21.780
but I keep reading about it and watching

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.340
things about it

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:26.040
because I think I was well I'm sorry I

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.199
was just a funny conversation go ahead

01:34:28.199 --> 01:34:31.199
yeah I was trying to like

01:34:31.199 --> 01:34:33.900
um reflect back a little bit of what you

01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:36.179
were saying Bonnie about how time has

01:34:36.179 --> 01:34:37.620
these different

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:41.460
qualities and Frameworks based on the

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.040
body that we're talking about right so

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.560
the reality of my son the body of the

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.880
ocean the body body yes

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.360
oh so that's good that's good so I

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.159
started by saying well you know the body

01:34:56.159 --> 01:34:59.159
has their clocks and then you took

01:34:59.159 --> 01:35:01.260
what we're trying to do to see these

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.179
other things as bodies and they have

01:35:03.179 --> 01:35:04.920
their own clocks

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.020
hmm cool

01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:10.500
get it very good awesome yeah like The

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.580
evolutionary the ocean is a body right

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:16.860
the body emotion and and the Mother

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.719
Temple order

01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:21.540
is that that could be a way of

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.760
conceiving what a body is is that it's

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.840
something that is associated with a

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.600
specific well this is exactly what

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.739
Whitehead said that every entity

01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:37.560
has its own specific duration

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.719
and

01:35:39.719 --> 01:35:43.679
that's what makes it uh entity and not a

01:35:43.679 --> 01:35:45.480
heap let's say

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.860
um

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:50.400
uh yeah I think the Hindus said the same

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.860
thing they said that everything lives

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.840
for 100 years a fruit Finance for 100

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.940
Year Rama lives for 100 years but yeah

01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.540
rate of which 100 years is varies

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:03.139
cool

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.900
that's one of those perspectival shifts

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:09.300
right instead of saying my dog was 50

01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:13.739
yeah everything was for 100 years

01:36:13.739 --> 01:36:15.480
but from all

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:18.380
there's like a temporal inertial point

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:22.320
so there's a and from our inertial point

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.960
the dog was for 15 years but when the

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.760
dogs

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.820
inertial Point temporal inertia it lives

01:36:29.820 --> 01:36:33.440
for 100 years that's really beautiful

01:36:42.679 --> 01:36:46.380
so I'm curious about how like

01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:48.480
um breakage processing kind of keeps

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.920
into this I had a conversation with

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:50.880
friends

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:53.219
it was like so excited he wasn't reading

01:36:53.219 --> 01:36:55.440
a book that kind of used this as a basis

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.400
and

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.440
and I was like through this course now

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:01.380
to reflected reflectivity making like

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.300
kind of the opposite point or like like

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.239
part on the stack like your your section

01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:10.080
you wrote in the memory course about uh

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.600
predictive processing model and how it's

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:15.300
quite strong and they try to understand

01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.040
what's wrong with it

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.560
and and people say but no there's like

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.420
it's still simulate it's still

01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:24.000
predicting uh whatever layer you look at

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.260
it so yeah and wasn't back and forth we

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.659
didn't at some point I was saying okay

01:37:30.659 --> 01:37:32.400
but you know there's some point there's

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.620
something new happening there's no Arab

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:36.840
predictions failing so what's happening

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.060
there there's an update happening yeah

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.639
and then and then and then what how this

01:37:41.639 --> 01:37:44.340
is happening but it's like kind of like

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.199
there's something missing something not

01:37:46.199 --> 01:37:47.840
explaining there

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.900
yeah so I would say for sure the

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:54.659
metaphor of predictive processing helps

01:37:54.659 --> 01:37:58.199
open the explanatory inquiry

01:37:58.199 --> 01:38:00.780
um but and I and

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.719
it's as if

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:05.880
there's predictive processing but I

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.199
don't think

01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:09.179
it's Lucid enough

01:38:09.179 --> 01:38:12.480
to be the the best that we're going to

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:15.300
come up with in terms of

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.699
um so that I I'm not I'm not arguing

01:38:17.699 --> 01:38:19.139
that it isn't

01:38:19.139 --> 01:38:22.320
powerful to do way to do science and to

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.860
do Ai and stuff like that but

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:28.880
there's something

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:33.860
like I wrote on Twitter like when

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:37.380
when I'm doing math

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:40.199
my brain is not doing math then what is

01:38:40.199 --> 01:38:41.940
it doing

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:43.679
you know when I'm doing math one plus

01:38:43.679 --> 01:38:47.040
one equals two or when I'm talking in in

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.920
words when I'm talking a words my brain

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.280
is not talking to itself in words

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.100
but the computational scientists think

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.620
think that when I'm doing math my brain

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.080
is doing math

01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.360
this is the same problem my brain

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.000
doesn't talk to itself in math any more

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.219
than my brain talks to itself in words

01:39:08.219 --> 01:39:10.320
when I'm talking

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:14.400
so I wrote when my when I am doing math

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:16.800
my brain is not doing math so then what

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.900
is it doing and then people were like of

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:20.219
course your brain is doing that through

01:39:20.219 --> 01:39:22.440
the computational you know whatever but

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.540
it's the same do you see what I'm saying

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.520
it's the same

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.840
category error

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:32.460
in fact when I'm doing math my brain is

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.400
doing something much more like what a

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.920
single cell organism is doing in a pool

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.760
of pond water

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.400
which is weird

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.679
but it's much more like that if you see

01:39:46.679 --> 01:39:48.900
neurons connecting and they look like

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.659
little animals like when I'm doing math

01:39:51.659 --> 01:39:53.460
my brain is actually doing something

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.260
much more like

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.679
what organisms do in pond water

01:39:58.679 --> 01:40:02.480
or what continuous sensing continues

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.639
exactly or micro what mycorrhiza I do in

01:40:05.639 --> 01:40:08.040
the soil that's what actually is more

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.900
like what is happening in my brain when

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:13.400
I'm I'm doing math

01:40:19.159 --> 01:40:22.679
the predictive metaphor as kind of a way

01:40:22.679 --> 01:40:25.460
to explain everything

01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:28.380
in experience there's just noise without

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.659
any like prediction so if you move to

01:40:30.659 --> 01:40:33.540
prediction which is definitely right

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:36.360
it's coarse grain it's a coarse grained

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.739
model

01:40:37.739 --> 01:40:40.560
um but yeah

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.780
yeah we're radical here

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:45.780
yes

01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:49.020
one last physics thing because I said

01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:51.420
about a month ago or two

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.760
and then you know it in a double slit

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.980
experiment until it's observed

01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:58.080
it's it's not it doesn't land as a

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.900
particle it's not a particle it's just a

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:03.900
possibility it's potential and this

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:06.719
that video I sent you about physicists

01:41:06.719 --> 01:41:08.520
have done the math and they believe that

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.620
black holes are the Observer they're

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.780
acting like the Observer so if that's

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.900
true and big big bang is true The

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.179
Observer came first

01:41:18.179 --> 01:41:22.340
okay so it means that black holes

01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:25.199
Deco hear the wave

01:41:25.199 --> 01:41:28.980
coherence yeah

01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:31.739
they put and and

01:41:31.739 --> 01:41:34.320
um if you watch the video I'm going to

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.719
post an entropy

01:41:36.719 --> 01:41:40.760
um it it turns out what he says is that

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.159
most of the entropy in the universe is

01:41:44.159 --> 01:41:47.060
in black holes

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.619
um

01:41:49.619 --> 01:41:52.139
or no could be the opposite

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:54.239
I forget well that same video said

01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:56.219
there's an event horizon at the edge of

01:41:56.219 --> 01:41:59.159
the expanding universe that is also

01:41:59.159 --> 01:42:02.340
has an event horizon it infers we are

01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.440
inside a black hole well they didn't say

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.380
that but the event was another at the

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:10.080
edge of the expanding universe and at

01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:12.480
the Event Horizon of a black hole with

01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.060
the same kind of structure and this is

01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:18.060
where our ability to mental model is

01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:21.239
very difficult because

01:42:21.239 --> 01:42:23.940
we think of an expanding universe and we

01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:25.380
think of a sphere

01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:28.860
and then the black hole that's at the

01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.659
center could be the same black hole

01:42:30.659 --> 01:42:31.800
that's

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.719
at the edge you know what I'm saying

01:42:33.719 --> 01:42:36.780
like like these these

01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:40.139
it's on the black hole the black holes

01:42:40.139 --> 01:42:43.440
could be connected or the same thing as

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.719
the periphery where it's outside exactly

01:42:45.719 --> 01:42:48.060
the the center and the hurricane could

01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:49.560
be the same thing that's pretty cool

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:53.760
yeah and it's just that we're so limited

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.320
um

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.300
it's very hard to

01:42:57.300 --> 01:43:00.480
live in that kind of a reality

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.340
but I'd love to have my mind boggled

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:05.239
like that it's fun

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:08.400
it's uh okay I've got to tie it in it's

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.739
all this is occurring in the field of

01:43:10.739 --> 01:43:13.280
awareness

01:43:19.139 --> 01:43:21.540
would there be awareness without play

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.840
though

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.440
would there be awareness of that play

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.360
well you know some people think it

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.159
depends how you use these terms some

01:43:35.159 --> 01:43:37.860
people say you know play is

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.980
you know this is all a play and Obama's

01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.960
head or somebody's head

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.760
um these are

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.159
I guess what I meant was that the

01:43:47.159 --> 01:43:50.520
quality of awareness I think changes

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:51.960
dynamically

01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:55.320
when something like this happens where

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:58.560
all of a sudden we just kind of let

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.560
loose and we're talking about things

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.780
that wouldn't help us have a discussion

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:07.920
with our teenage son immediately but

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.320
then it could you know I'm just thinking

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.219
of you Kimberly

01:44:13.699 --> 01:44:16.560
mine's no longer at home and I certainly

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:19.440
remember the time in which I had to let

01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.179
him know that the fact that he was

01:44:21.179 --> 01:44:23.040
taller than me

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:27.480
was actually and big you know that when

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:30.840
the voice came out that my body was

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:33.480
scared even though he wouldn't

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:36.540
absolutely was not threatening me in the

01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:39.239
least but I felt like I needed to tell

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:42.000
him that that effect was beginning to

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.199
happen

01:44:43.199 --> 01:44:45.480
because other people wouldn't say that

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:48.420
but they would react to him in a way

01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:51.780
that he wouldn't be able to recognize

01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:55.320
you know speaking of bodies and you know

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:57.000
because he was looking down on me with

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.860
this like deep voice

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.260
and and if he was slightly upset or

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:03.239
whatever which is totally entitled to

01:45:03.239 --> 01:45:05.639
all of a sudden it was like

01:45:05.639 --> 01:45:08.340
oh my God this is scary you know my

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:13.260
paleo brain went into like fear and then

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:15.540
it's like this ridiculous this is this

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.780
is Andre Okay but he needs to know

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:22.260
that is now capable of having that

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.340
effect bodies in space

01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.480
yeah and body is in relationship right

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.360
bodies developing and changing over time

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.600
right like

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.460
eliciting different responses within

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.780
their environment

01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:42.420
something can be a prey one one month

01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:45.300
and the next day be the pleasure right

01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:47.460
well I would argue that Kimberly's

01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:49.739
presence here and which she's

01:45:49.739 --> 01:45:52.760
energetically absorbing is directly

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.199
affecting her son and the people in her

01:45:55.199 --> 01:45:56.219
environment because that's the way

01:45:56.219 --> 01:45:57.840
energy works

01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:00.960
I mean he he will be affected by who you

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:03.900
are being out of being here it becomes a

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.460
part of you I would say

01:46:08.219 --> 01:46:11.340
and if that's the case then the fact

01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:15.000
that we are now radiating in ways that

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.400
are completely different since what I

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.040
like to call the great confinement which

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.560
was an acceleration and a

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:25.739
synchronization of our species I mean

01:46:25.739 --> 01:46:29.400
we're all so fascinated by starlings you

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.260
know

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.900
but we were

01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:37.380
synchronized to be at home

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:41.699
you know whatever home meant and you

01:46:41.699 --> 01:46:43.920
know this has never happened to our

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.540
entire species

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:49.260
so I think there's something

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:52.679
from an evolutionary standpoint that you

01:46:52.679 --> 01:46:53.820
know

01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:57.840
a a punctuated equilibrium and and a

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:01.320
species branching that we're you know

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:04.380
kind of participating in

01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:08.460
right here and I think with Bonnie so

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:12.060
much of what I feel is crucial is is

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.560
this

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.460
awareness I mean this this positionality

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:21.060
and this understanding of of our paleo

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:24.420
hard wiring which is not negotiable I

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:26.580
mean unless you want to Lop off some

01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.659
part of

01:47:27.659 --> 01:47:29.760
you know your body

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.639
and and how we show up for what's

01:47:32.639 --> 01:47:35.760
already happening not some change that's

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.280
coming in the future I think it's it's I

01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.020
think you're absolutely right bunnies

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.699
the kids

01:47:41.699 --> 01:47:43.100
I mean

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:46.920
teenagers locked for two years that

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.420
would be enough to change the entire

01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:51.679
species I think

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:55.560
rock and roll did it the atomic bomb did

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:56.400
it

01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.119
you know

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:03.600
rock and roll the atomic bomb

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.119
yeah

01:48:05.119 --> 01:48:08.900
across modal synthesis

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.699
how is rock and roll like the atomic

01:48:11.699 --> 01:48:14.060
bomb oh they're just the same thing

01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:17.880
they're extreme Cadillac amplifiers of

01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.520
latency yeah no I think there's a lot

01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:24.659
going on and and it's nice to see

01:48:24.659 --> 01:48:27.600
um yeah I read I read something today

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.300
the average CEO

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:33.659
it's I think it's in the U.S is 54 years

01:48:33.659 --> 01:48:35.100
old now

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.500
and it's it's getting younger

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.179
so

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:39.719
um

01:48:39.719 --> 01:48:42.179
just before the lockdown the the the

01:48:42.179 --> 01:48:44.699
average age of the sea you would never

01:48:44.699 --> 01:48:46.860
know because our government is

01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:49.800
built with like geriatric cases

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.320
but in business it's dropping quite

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.420
radically so

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.199
um

01:48:55.199 --> 01:48:57.360
yeah so don't piss off your friend

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.400
Samuel they're going to be your bosses

01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:05.460
today

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:07.020
an interesting experience I was I was

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:09.239
helping your friend moving stuff and we

01:49:09.239 --> 01:49:11.760
were carrying a lot of stuff and then I

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.679
had to think about suddenly what we're

01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:15.560
doing there is like slightly

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:18.780
reflectivity when moving in short

01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.460
corners and then I said okay okay

01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:23.460
opponent processing like this kind of

01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.920
back force and feeling into it and then

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:28.199
so then further thinking I used here for

01:49:28.199 --> 01:49:30.000
electricity using okay with it because

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.460
sometimes you critique or like doubt or

01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.699
like

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.400
that's true because there's much more

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.040
going on just like okay feeling into oh

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.320
this direction now back and all this

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.420
it's like there's so much more going on

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:48.119
that that the metaphor is not not really

01:49:48.119 --> 01:49:50.880
sufficient in a way exactly so I was

01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:53.159
like I was it was a cooler to see that

01:49:53.159 --> 01:49:56.219
and to see even not get stuck in operate

01:49:56.219 --> 01:49:59.159
processing in a way yeah and the problem

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:01.500
with our opponent processing it says

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:04.440
zero-sum game more of this lesson yeah

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.520
more of this less than that versus life

01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:11.880
has the ability to for you know like to

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.260
make something out of nothing and

01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.360
continue to make it you know there

01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.159
there's a lot more going on in the

01:50:17.159 --> 01:50:20.280
excellent yeah it's like I really it

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.520
makes me very happy when people

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:24.780
um

01:50:24.780 --> 01:50:27.239
when they share things that are like

01:50:27.239 --> 01:50:29.940
everyday things

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:30.600
um

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.179
use use what we've been talking about

01:50:33.179 --> 01:50:35.760
you know instead of uh

01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:38.699
having them be you know like a lot of

01:50:38.699 --> 01:50:39.960
the stuff we talked about today was

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:43.619
esoteric but then then

01:50:43.619 --> 01:50:46.080
each yeah the richness of just a regular

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.100
experience you know

01:50:51.179 --> 01:50:54.380
is very important

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.980
oh and you bring that and I think so

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:04.199
much because my first piece I read I

01:51:04.199 --> 01:51:07.760
told you was the horse where's the

01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:11.760
rewildings yeah cognition and it was

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.639
smack in the beginning of covet I think

01:51:14.639 --> 01:51:16.860
that I read it

01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:20.520
um and and it was like okay here we go

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:25.940
it's gonna be a wild ride you know

01:51:26.239 --> 01:51:29.040
and and it's like

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:29.659
um

01:51:29.659 --> 01:51:32.280
fasten your seat belt but at the same

01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:37.080
time go for the discomfort don't try to

01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:41.340
land this I I really like I've gotten

01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:43.020
allergic to

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:45.780
so many of these operations how does it

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.060
land I don't want to land yeah right now

01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:51.380
I mean I really don't I mean

01:51:51.380 --> 01:51:54.480
obviously maybe it's because I see

01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:57.600
myself more in the sea so it's not

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.719
really about Landing yeah it's it's more

01:52:00.719 --> 01:52:05.100
about like how I surface you know

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:05.760
um

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.639
because I feel like I'm I've been in

01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:12.360
this sort of saturation diving you know

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.540
um and now I need to go through this

01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.940
process of

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:21.780
decompression yeah very slowly yeah and

01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.820
blow up and it's kudos to everybody

01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:27.119
who's been here in the whole course just

01:52:27.119 --> 01:52:29.460
about is

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.600
um

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:32.760
it's the discipline of starting just

01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.639
with the dispositional state try and

01:52:35.639 --> 01:52:38.040
then trying to stay in that and then try

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.440
it and stay back so then trying to you

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.320
know and then it really

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:46.440
builds the capacity to track these kind

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:49.020
of crazier conversations without having

01:52:49.020 --> 01:52:51.780
all these sliding meetings and

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.699
um and like what Kimberly said about no

01:52:53.699 --> 01:52:55.800
I was talking about clocks and bought it

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:58.739
was like oh she's reflecting back to me

01:52:58.739 --> 01:53:01.260
so because I was just thinking of bodies

01:53:01.260 --> 01:53:02.159
as

01:53:02.159 --> 01:53:04.440
the body and then she was making like

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:08.100
one of the things I would have said so

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:11.520
um yeah so that's really nice to see you

01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:13.679
know we have a couple more classes on

01:53:13.679 --> 01:53:15.900
the awareness to probably go more like

01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.880
this I'm not sure and then we'll be in

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.300
Recaps face which will be

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:22.020
um

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:25.380
very open dialogue

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:26.179
um

01:53:26.179 --> 01:53:30.179
just just to share our experience with

01:53:30.179 --> 01:53:32.520
the whole thing and

01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.560
um then we have a little bit of break in

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.000
it I'm going to do something different

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.440
with the fall schedule I'm not quite

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:39.960
sure yet I have some cool ideas

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.760
um but I like to keep people in systems

01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:44.820
no I haven't decided yet so

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:47.639
um yeah so

01:53:47.639 --> 01:53:48.480
um

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:50.520
yeah it's been a productive year I mean

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.639
there's a lot of content on there

01:53:53.639 --> 01:53:56.760
um and uh I'm glad you you were there

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.840
too

01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.880
I find it almost impossible to write

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:03.000
without thinking of who I'm writing for

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.139
and it's been very very helpful for me

01:54:07.139 --> 01:54:11.820
to be in the pop-up School space when

01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:15.420
uh when I'm writing so yeah you're a big

01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.860
part of it

01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:17.940
yeah

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:22.139
the placenta the placenta is between all

01:54:22.139 --> 01:54:23.280
of us

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.440
thank you my friends thank you for a

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:29.100
wonderful Saturday afternoon



## Cohort 5

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.420
are there any questions

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.019
or some noticings that people would like

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.900
to surface or share before

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
we start this morning sometimes we wait

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.600
we get so I want to do a kind of a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.080
little contemplation and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.920
late skis

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.939
get some people it's burly

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.579
So today we're going to talk about

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.640
um

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.840
we're going to start with awareness and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.160
then we're going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.480
um

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.939
talk about reflexivity reflexive

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.560
awareness

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560
um

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.680
in a little bit

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.580
so let me just put this quite this up on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.000
the screen

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.200
see if we can dive right into it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.200
just

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.759
what is it that I am aware of

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.520
when I am aware of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.840
being aware

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.260
what is it that I am aware of when I am

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.319
aware of being aware so

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.379
um

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.420
we started by looking at something like

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.520
I have this cool rock

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.819
that Marie gave me

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.640
and I can be aware that I'm touching it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.580
I can be aware that I'm looking at it so

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.860
that's one level so we have this notion

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.599
of perceptual depth

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.980
and we use this before and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.300
um the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.420
course the module on perception so at

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.879
first I just see it's a rock I didn't

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.459
really look at it I predicted that it's

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.099
a rock I'm not really perceiving it and

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.459
then I can perceive it at a certain

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.660
um

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.660
scale a certain depth let's say I see

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.180
it's round this is some three big blobs

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.860
then I can

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.800
really become more absorbed in the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.019
perception of it or the tactile feeling

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.760
of it

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.300
um I notice it's a tiny little

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.120
hole here that I can't even see but I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.599
can feel so and then I can

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.819
see really trying to see the patterns

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.819
what make up the pattern so this is

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.299
zooming in and then in order to zoom in

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.120
closer I I would need something like a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.040
microscope right because now I'm at the

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.959
limit

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.360
of my faculty

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.319
so I could continue then to see use a

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.640
microscope

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.819
and then a better microscope and I might

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.599
even be able to use a scanning electron

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.280
microscope

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.220
so that's one kind of perceptual depth

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.319
it's the same thread all the way through

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.540
does that make sense

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.519
This this term we're using

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.560
and then we saw there's something else

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.600
that can happen if I'm really meditating

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.080
on what is perception

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.540
at a certain point I reached the limit

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.500
of what I can see and then

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.759
I start to see that

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.940
their perception of this rock

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.780
is discontinuous you can this is easy to

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.360
do if you look at a DOT on a piece of

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.000
paper and you try to stare at it you

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.820
will notice first for most of us our

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.820
attention is discontinuous you can't

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.880
actually stare at it but if you force

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.100
yourself to stare at it you will notice

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.400
that it disappears so at this point

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.740
you're not looking at something about

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.580
the rock you're looking at your mind

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.180
your mind is updating recycling updating

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.759
uh there's a fatigue that happens when

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.280
you stare at something and then it kind

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.680
of shuts itself down it updates right so

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.300
that's a different type of perceptual

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.100
depth and this is what happens when we

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.919
meditate we start to you start with

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.020
perception and then we're starting to

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.660
actually look at the phenomenon in our

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.259
minds there's a orthogonal move to what

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.900
we are seeing

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.620
difference between the two one is just

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.720
the same thread all the way through the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.280
other one

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.039
we start to

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.400
look at the virtual aspect of perception

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.919
we start to see the phenomenon in our

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.080
mind that are associated with this

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.860
and this can lead to different insights

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.460
is everybody with me so far

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.160
uh no yes okay I would like to presence

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.020
that I slept this morning and and not

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.080
last night so at the moment you I'm just

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.000
looking at the screen people talking so

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.180
I'll I'll catch up but uh I have a bit

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.560
of a brain of uh Fork at the moment

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.199
okay it might be good when we as we

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.020
continue I mean you can leverage brain

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.340
fog

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.000
um

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.900
which will be interesting so yeah yeah I

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.520
just presented so it helps me and and

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.380
you know where I'm at so but yes yes

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.120
okay

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.240
no I think that's cool

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.680
um

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.500
okay I I and I I followed all your

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.000
writings okay to infinitely like but I

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.400
haven't uh watched the video so I'm I'm

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.819
kinda in the loop and kind of love okay

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.360
yeah just

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.039
just

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:04.680
so now we're going to look at this is a

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.740
different question so now I'm looking at

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.300
the Rock

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.180
and I'm using this as a tool to then say

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.759
well I'm aware that I'm looking at the

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.940
Rock

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.840
and is that two things happening when I

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.560
look at the Rock and then I can feel

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.740
I'm looking at the Rock and now

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.680
I'm in a different state where I'm aware

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.539
that I'm looking at the Rock

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.759
something funny happens

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.639
it's very hard for me

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:42.419
to look closely at the Rock

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:45.419
and to then investigate this awareness

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:47.520
thing at the same time

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.580
I feel it slides I feel it's an

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.440
oscillation

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.319
I feel that

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.979
in the first instance the object is The

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.840
Rock and I'm looking at it and then I

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.360
let my mind slip and say oh I'm aware of

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.000
looking at the Rock and I notice that

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.880
the object of my awareness is no longer

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.300
The Rock it's this awareness thing

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.580
so there's this something that slides

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.560
this is a different type of perceptual

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.539
depth does that make it's not like

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:21.360
either one of the other two

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.220
does that make sense

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.379
or at least some kind of sense that we

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.419
have three things going on they have

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:30.360
different biomarkers and you all did

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.120
these exercises earlier and noticed you

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.459
use these terms oscillation

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:37.680
that

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.680
that there's something happening

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.659
um

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.940
that it oscillates between nearly

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.580
looking at the Rock and then you know I

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.100
take a stance we talk about it as

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.160
getting behind this is just a mental

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.339
model and now I'm aware that I was

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:58.380
looking at the Rock so now we come to

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.540
this question what is it that I'm aware

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.339
of when I'm aware of being aware

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.640
and I'm just going to

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.640
um

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.480
at this point I'm just going to instruct

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.779
you

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.779
um about a possible answer uh instruct

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:24.420
about a possible answer is interesting

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.459
uh phrase

00:09:26.459 --> 00:09:29.540
and that is

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.540
that if you

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.920
if you

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.500
are not doing we talked about the

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.839
difference between

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.480
vipassana which is you really if you

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.959
really try to examine what I'm aware of

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:50.100
when I'm becoming aware you will slip

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.240
into

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.560
looking at the thoughts and then we get

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.180
into this oh well there must be

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.160
something in my mind that's aware of

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.260
being aware and then we get into these

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.320
infinite regress and you'll be able to

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.320
with a certain with a certain type of

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.140
inquiry you will be able you will slip

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.779
into a simulation

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:15.480
and some of us talked about that

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.940
but if you just attend to

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.240
that being aware if you just attempt to

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.380
being aware of being aware

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.060
without

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.339
examining it with your internal eye

00:10:35.339 --> 00:10:36.899
because that will

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:41.040
slip you into a simulation

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.500
chances are you discover you're just

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.480
sitting there it's something that has to

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.040
do with your body

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.440
that is it the awareness is

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.339
served up by your body

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.560
if you gently attend to being aware of

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.959
your surroundings

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:07.440
and now I'm aware the energy

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.200
from my hands

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.839
I notice that this awareness

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:16.760
is like my body

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.560
it's like the simplest answer

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.720
that no one ever comes to

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.500
now you see I'm not this is different

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.260
I'm not being aware of my bodily

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.899
Sensations

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.720
that's a perception of my body with

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.279
Sensations

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:47.339
I'm I I'm not

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:50.519
so so now we've rediscovered like when

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.680
you're aware of your body as Sensations

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.500
you feel this you feel that you see this

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.680
you see that this is a fragmentation

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.899
just like when I look around and I see

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:05.480
this I see that I see this I see that

00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:12.899
this is the the new theory of the body

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:14.880
so a lot do you see what I'm saying

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.339
mostly when we start working with the

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:21.360
body we we attend to

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.339
the sights and the smells and the

00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:26.339
sensations and the affects and the

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:28.980
dispositional state but behind that is

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.800
the ability to be aware of those things

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.920
which is the body itself

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.240
just like

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.300
I I work on perception I see this I see

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.399
that I see this I can have perceptual

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:45.600
death but the ability for that open to

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.180
be open to have those experience to be

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.160
open to perception

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.420
is the body that is a just the ground of

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.959
awareness

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:09.320
so you start with being aware of

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.579
something maybe just the room

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.380
but just attend to it and then

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.820
what's reflected back as an answer that

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.100
question is just the presence of your

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.120
body

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.740
this is what is

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:36.899
it is available it is open

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.660
it is present this is

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.240
the receptivity which is awareness

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.660
Bonnie's yeah I I remember

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.040
um

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.720
at one point

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.940
you were describing

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.240
a relationship to pen

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.279
that had something to do with the fall

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:19.560
you know and your arm and everything and

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.040
I would just hit me was okay this

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.279
awareness this receptivity

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:30.899
how does pain enter into that

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.940
um

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.180
of whatever nature because I think in

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.500
that

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.560
um

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.040
is a lot of how

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040
are

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.699
occlusion of the body as receptivity

00:14:50.699 --> 00:14:52.740
kind of gets

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.519
maimed it's the relationship to pain I

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:58.220
mean maybe I'm kind of trying to go

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.540
diminish the body because we

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:07.519
so when Eric uh

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.079
what's his name tall not Eric told

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:13.339
what's his first name

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.800
the cause the pain body he's not talking

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.959
about your body he's talking about he's

00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:25.380
talking about the pain body uh so pain

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.839
so you when you're

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:30.680
if you're

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.060
you know mindful or heedful if you

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.180
attend if you can while the pain is

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.639
arising if you can attend to what's

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.500
happening in your experience you will

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.540
notice

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.139
that

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:49.380
the pain is not in your body it's in

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.740
mostly in your mind it's a thought so

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.079
you have people that got rushed to the

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:57.060
hospital and excruciating pain because

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.420
the nail got driven you know Spike got

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.060
driven through their their foot and

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.600
it actually it went between the toes

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.860
so there's all kinds of uh that so

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.300
so

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.600
you can be aware of the structure of

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.440
pain

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.500
and say well what if I don't have the

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.360
thought if this guy did that and said

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.579
what if I don't have the thought that my

00:16:23.579 --> 00:16:26.279
leg is maimed and I checked into my body

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:29.220
he would find oh there's actually

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.560
nothing happening

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.839
so

00:16:33.839 --> 00:16:35.820
um

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.600
so

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.899
the other day a couple of weeks ago I

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:46.399
was at a symposium

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.959
and

00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:51.839
um there was a big brouhaha at the end

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:53.880
of the second session

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.279
and a lot of

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.800
energy that had to be released had to be

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.520
released and then the next morning I got

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.799
into my car and I drove into a clearing

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:11.100
in the woods and I put on some

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.220
um

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:17.100
evangelist music and danced in the field

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.160
and I was crying and then there were

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.199
like waves I was crying and it was

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:25.799
joyful dancing you know just purging and

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:27.660
then there would be a contraction and I

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:31.860
and I'd say but why is it so painful

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:35.039
why is like I knew I was just and then I

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:37.559
was like why is it so painful

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:40.080
and it would be like psychologically so

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.500
and then I caught it the question why is

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.020
it so painful was a thought

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.480
and I just said well what does it really

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.400
feel like crying and it just felt like

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.679
crying

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:55.500
so every single psychological

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.360
contraction you have around anything

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.620
um

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.820
if it's painful in that way and not just

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.520
something that your a rhythm in your

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.039
body then there's a thought that's

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:13.559
causing the pain

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:15.720
and the thought is optional now

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.539
sometimes you have to work out why the

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:23.480
thought is constructed that way and but

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.500
so you're right the fact that we have

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.280
this mental construct that the pain is

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.799
in the body makes us

00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:38.100
um go into thoughts to try to escape

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.480
them and and this is the big

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.360
bait and switch of

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.400
um prejudicing their mind because the

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.919
pain is is in the thought

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:53.640
that accompanies in sensation now you

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.260
can be overwhelmed like I was

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.720
overwhelmed with energy and the Terrors

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.780
will come because and then the overwhelm

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.880
with energy we have a habit then to

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.539
go into the mind and that's when it

00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:11.700
becomes painful because it attaches

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.980
itself to thought in this case

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.100
I was sit I was there being doing my due

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.260
diligence don't get into like who said

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.440
who to what and so I didn't have any of

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.080
those thoughts and then it snuckered in

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.140
but why is it so painful it was so meta

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.440
and minimalist I almost didn't catch it

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.140
um yeah so uh

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.299
integrate the body Liberate the mind

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:41.840
right that's it from my Origins itself

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.520
uh series

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.900
um

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.900
it's it's hard to integrate the body if

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.039
you don't Liberate the mind and so

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.140
so but what we're saying here too is

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.480
that if the ground of awareness is your

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.760
body this is why you can be aware of the

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.580
thoughts in your mind because the

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.320
question is well how can my mind be

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.820
aware of its own thoughts and you're

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.419
like it can't your body is aware of the

00:20:09.419 --> 00:20:11.280
thoughts in your mind

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.320
the body is the resource

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:18.960
um

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.640
I just want to throw another

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:25.860
um because I'm I'm listening to your

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.600
description

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.260
um or I'm seeing it in my mind of going

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.280
having to go out I mean what what drove

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.780
you to drive out and have this

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.640
and that reminds me of you know some

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.100
writing that you did um I think it was

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.820
around the the the the the the

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.799
maple thing and

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:57.240
you basically say something like

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.080
um we face just one problem and just one

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.720
solution the problem of intimacy and the

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.840
solution of intimacy

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.400
now if we put that together with you

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.220
know just thoughts in the mind

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.820
um and the pain and what has you dancing

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.240
crying and screaming

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.059
and you indicated why did this person

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:28.260
say this or do that so that indicates to

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.320
me that the pain is also connected to to

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.080
this question of intimacy

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.960
and so it's not just oh let's identify

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.960
the thoughts and separate ourselves from

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.640
the thoughts and go back to awareness

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.460
which is this very kind of sovereign

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.140
you know

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.000
um

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.679
almost self-helpish kind of thing and I

00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:54.419
know that that's not what you're asking

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:57.059
what I'm saying but let's go back so

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:00.480
when you're a child in something when

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.120
you're a child you only have so much

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.059
capacity

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:09.240
and you don't have

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.179
you have awareness but you don't you're

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:13.740
not aware that you're aware unless

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.419
you're one of these precocious children

00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:17.520
sometimes see

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.620
to have all these

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:23.340
um and you can't your your job as a

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.460
child is to organize reality into

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.559
self-other and world

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:30.360
and you're trying to have a theory of

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.299
causality we talked about this so then

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:35.000
something and then

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.380
psychologically you know the

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.120
psychological relationship between you

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.760
and adults and parents and stuff uh

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.220
you're very vulnerable okay so something

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.400
happens to your body

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.020
um

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.919
and one of the mechanisms is that that

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:56.520
we have with other animals is you you

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.919
stop being aware

00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:01.260
we call it dissociation but basically

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.340
you're you're just not aware you're you

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.280
can't it's too overwhelming

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.200
um so

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.600
that's a good thing I mean this is a

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.780
good this is a feature not a bug of all

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.179
animal behavior right like when the

00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:21.000
animals die or something

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.480
um prey or whatever so then but then it

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.620
gets complicated because when you come

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.580
back you're trying to figure it out

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.059
and trying to figure it out uh

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:38.220
especially if you're isolated

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.280
is a very complex thing because you

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.679
don't have a mind that has enough

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:46.860
capacity to figure it out

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.980
so you you makes you make simple

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.600
constructions

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.480
about the good bad mother or the good

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.820
bad father and then you have to figure

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.880
out how can the evil father and the good

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.640
father be together

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.799
but this is the only way you could you

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.539
can only organize this is why it's

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:09.320
called archetypal because archetypes

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.840
comes they're archetypal like and

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.480
they're and dualistic because you just

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.960
don't have a very nuanced mind when

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.280
you're young

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:26.159
and so so but you will notice

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:29.820
that this is the work of the mind to

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.039
figure out causality to make good and

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:35.940
bad to categorize so your mind is trying

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.260
to organize things and then it it gets

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.020
these these it's not integrated it's not

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.380
integrated I mean and so they become

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.179
categories that your mind

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.840
it's like analyzed you know like like

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.780
your mind this these are deep structures

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.460
that everything else that comes in your

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.820
mind is put in those boxes

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.100
and this is something to be liberated

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.440
about so

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.100
um

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.280
um

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:15.200
so

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.539
that's you know these are this is real

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:21.559
the real part of the human condition

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:23.460
is

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.080
um

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.679
is

00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:29.940
that the

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.419
early ways we organize reality

00:25:33.419 --> 00:25:36.779
over determine us for many many years

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:38.640
going forward

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.279
and they're subject to extremely

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:45.000
simplistic constructions

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.440
if you're lucky you have a teacher or an

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.880
older friend

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.100
who helps you

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.679
understand what's going on

00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:58.860
but in most cases the worse the abuse

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.880
the lonelier you are and so

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.020
um

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.620
yeah so and then the and then these

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:12.840
simple constructions over determine uh

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.659
even your memory of the past

00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:17.700
I mean I worked with it someone once

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.620
that said you know

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.179
uh

00:26:21.179 --> 00:26:26.419
there was this root image of him

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.240
wanting his mother and she didn't come

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.700
and he'd gotten so when he relived that

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.039
he goes and she didn't come and she

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:37.080
didn't come and eat and she he would cry

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.120
and then he would say but you know I

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.940
know maybe like and I'm like

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.580
none of that is real except that it

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.559
could have been two seconds it could

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.659
have been 30 seconds it could have been

00:26:48.659 --> 00:26:52.140
an hour you don't know because you were

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.559
not even walking yet right so I had this

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:57.779
deep structure

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:00.900
that he tried to make sense of and it

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.120
just got more and more complex and then

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.679
forgiving her and then understanding

00:27:04.679 --> 00:27:07.020
that she was an adult and but it was

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.480
like in his mind

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.919
it was a huge she didn't come

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:18.200
she didn't come you know and so

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.659
there was many instances in his life

00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:22.740
where

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.500
some small version of that would take on

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.480
that much intensity

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.480
um and then once he realized that

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.380
he had no real idea of

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.720
from a third person objective point of

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.820
view what actually happened

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.700
zero

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.980
they had no context he didn't have he

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.539
was too young to have an objective

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:51.000
Viewpoint of what happened

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.260
so what you just said

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.000
objective Viewpoint I mean is there

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.799
really this third person

00:27:58.799 --> 00:28:01.799
okay so that's that's I think where the

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:05.039
intimacy comes in I'm trying to be a

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:08.100
little bit pushy here no no because I'm

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.140
talking around until until you make a

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.480
thread so

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:17.419
in in the sense that you know if

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.380
I'm I'm gonna make a provocative

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.640
statement I I think our our Western

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.200
Cosmo Vision as it has habituated

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.039
um

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:32.279
um especially with industrialization and

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:33.779
spread out

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:37.580
um is is is is is

00:28:38.419 --> 00:28:42.380
structurally neurotic

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.640
I mean it's not an individual thing

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.900
there's I mean there's this propelling

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.140
about advancement you know whatever it

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.440
is I mean it's stage development you

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.140
know whatever there's this

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.080
kind of thing that

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.779
um you know and and everything that I

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:07.500
think

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.240
in this work we've been doing is is all

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.600
having to do with slowing the down

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:21.899
but not into like some La La Land but in

00:29:21.899 --> 00:29:24.960
a way short-circuiting interrupting this

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.659
you know what Walter Benjamin talked

00:29:27.659 --> 00:29:30.240
about the you know the wind of progress

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.620
that that the angel can't even close his

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.960
wings so I'm I'm I'm trying to connect

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.120
with you know what if you said something

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.760
like you know instead of the world's

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.580
power it's the will to relation I mean

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.220
that we're never so we're we're way out

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.039
of our module here and when we start the

00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:54.720
Recaps it will be this kind of

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.480
conversation I mean

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.299
um so so

00:30:00.299 --> 00:30:04.260
yeah it's all good but we got one more

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:06.000
module here and then we have a whole

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.220
round of Recaps where we're gonna just

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:10.919
do this and see if people can bring in

00:30:10.919 --> 00:30:12.899
some of their learning because this is

00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:15.659
you know the purpose of life is not just

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:17.760
to keep asking yourself what what are we

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.659
aware I understand again it's a very we

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:24.240
work it with these slivers

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.940
um and um and the intersection between

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.279
awareness and intimacy is something we

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:32.340
should talk about in the um

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.700
in the recap so sorry I know you have a

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.980
lot of energy and

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.980
um

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.980
and it's an interesting conversation but

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.120
um yeah

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.620
so

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.820
um

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.120
let's see if we can

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.000
um if some people can if they get a

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.919
sense of what I'm saying about

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:58.320
the difference between having the

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.380
question answered in the loopy loopy of

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:04.320
your mind versus

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.200
does anybody get this

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.640
this

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.419
real embodied awareness uh Insight that

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:14.580
it's it's this that's

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:20.700
the aware factor it's like just this

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.159
um or you can push back on it also yeah

00:31:23.159 --> 00:31:24.539
Bonnie

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:26.600
um

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.360
well so I I go to the alembic most

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.020
Thursdays and I sit with Mike and

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.539
you know he'll he'll often do a bunch of

00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:38.760
different things but he always makes his

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.140
way to

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.760
pointing out instructions it's like

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.779
always the

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:45.600
uh destination for him

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.580
um

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:53.640
and it's this noticing awareness but uh

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.399
I'm noticing with you it's like it has a

00:31:56.399 --> 00:31:58.200
very different flavor or what you're

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.020
suggesting it sounds different to me

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.899
than what he's suggesting you know he'll

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:05.940
usually say something like notice it's

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.820
all awareness the whole display it's all

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.559
just awake

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:12.380
um notice that now

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.659
and you're kind of saying notice it's

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:18.720
just it's the body that's aware and it's

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.039
like uh

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:22.080
I guess that's challenging of noticing

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.720
that that these instructions or these

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.640
suggestions are fed in through the mind

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.620
and I'm

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.720
taking Michael's word for it and I'm

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.380
taking your word for it and it's

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.279
conditioning the notice thing I'm

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:37.740
bringing and I'm like I'm on the one

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.080
hand trying to like let go of that uh

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.419
that suggestion that's got me going in

00:32:42.419 --> 00:32:44.220
my mind that's conditioning what I'm

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:49.039
trying to notice uh but

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:51.840
yeah that's that's what's difficult it's

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.820
like I'm starting with a prompt that's

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.700
in my mind uh and then trying to to

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.980
notice just what's there

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.419
um but at the same time like taking

00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:03.659
taking your word for it at the start

00:33:03.659 --> 00:33:05.100
um I guess that that's where it gets

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.140
tricky yeah yeah so uh a couple good

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:13.080
good noticing so I am saying something

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.480
very different than what I think Michael

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.179
Taft is saying so you're right there

00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:20.580
it's not like two different sides of the

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.320
coin

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.440
um

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:29.580
so and instructions are are tricky so I

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.159
did instructions the last three sessions

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.620
we did more of

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.580
um a little more of practice but one of

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.039
the things that

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:44.519
so I so one of the things that we're

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:47.460
doing in this course is to have a

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.019
biomarker

00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:52.919
and so a biomarker means if I'm if I'm

00:33:52.919 --> 00:33:55.980
looking at this rock so you can play

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.039
with this and and the challenge with my

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:02.000
work is it's extremely simple

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.279
so if I'm looking at this rock and I'm

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:08.460
just looking I can feel that

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.320
I'm just looking I don't have

00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:15.419
I can check and feel but I don't feel

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:17.639
any thoughts in my head I mean it's a

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.659
little hard now because I'm actually

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.060
talking but even then believe me I could

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.200
talk without uh without watching any

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:28.560
thoughts in my head okay so so this is a

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.159
biomarker I'm I'm just looking and then

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:37.679
I I'm going to switch to to wanting to

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:41.700
be aware that I can see the rock okay

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:44.580
now when I do that

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:50.300
I want to say did I slip into thought

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.520
when I make that move between just

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.980
looking at the Rock and then

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.320
wanting

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.700
to

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:05.240
notice that I'm aware of the Rock

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:09.200
where does the energy go

00:35:09.359 --> 00:35:11.880
if it goes in your head you're running a

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.160
simulation

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.280
I would say I think Michael Taft he

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.839
tells people you're always running a

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:20.220
simulation I think you're running a

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.359
simulation

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:23.579
so you're looking for what it is that

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:25.760
it's aware you think it's just awareness

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.359
this thing is now a mental thought

00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:31.920
awareness has become an object in your

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.119
mind

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:35.579
that's okay that's

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:38.760
then I can be aware that awareness

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.859
became an object in my mind and I can

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:44.579
Loop that in my mind or I pop out and

00:35:44.579 --> 00:35:46.140
like what's the where

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.540
of the mind it's just

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.760
my body really so so and that's not a

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.740
simulation I mean you're just what's

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.619
it's the same reason why why what's

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:01.619
aware of the Rock

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:05.160
not my mind my body is aware of the Rock

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.200
then I can be like

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.660
how am I aware of the Rock and I can

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.900
feel myself start simulating the

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.980
question

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.680
simulating awareness in my mind

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.079
so I'm like no not that that's not I'm

00:36:19.079 --> 00:36:22.740
not interested in that I can I'm just

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.960
interested in this single Loop problem

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.640
here

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.520
I look around what is it that's aware of

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.520
this it's my body

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.780
turns out the same thing same

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.119
equation that's aware of my mind a

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:41.579
little harder to get to from here but

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:44.400
that's what I am

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.780
claiming

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.040
uh

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.460
and a lot of it has to do with yes the

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.160
instructions and the posture and the

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.859
gesture of the meditation

00:36:55.859 --> 00:36:59.839
um is either going to put you into

00:36:59.839 --> 00:37:02.460
headspace where you will search for

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.000
awareness or it's going to put you into

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.240
just single Loop participation with the

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.000
world uh where you can find the answer

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.640
if you're careful

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.660
um

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.060
so you can play around with the practice

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.760
you shouldn't take it as an instruction

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.839
um and and but that is my claim it's my

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:30.060
my and my claim is that uh

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.280
um this

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.140
confusion

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.720
is a root cause of why

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.980
uh

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.900
we are separate from the natural world

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.119
and we destroy it

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:46.160
um that would be my claim

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.540
let's go on to the second slide and come

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.099
back because I think it might be helpful

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:51.900
too because there's something similar

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.839
going on in the second slide

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.400
um I don't want to go too fast but I

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.700
think when we come back they will help

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.380
each other if that's okay with everyone

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.220
can we do that

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.780
um but it's a good question Apostle has

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.160
the same questions if you work with

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.660
Michael and it's you know it's it's up

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:18.119
to you to to parse parse that out

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:20.520
um but the key is

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.700
when you're doing your due diligence

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.460
can you feel that now you're in your

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.500
mind and if you're in your mind it's a

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.660
simulation which is okay it's like if

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.820
you and I were trying to figure out the

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.220
plumbing design we'd be like what if I

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.560
put it's a simulation that's all it's

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.740
not it's not bad but then are you

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.599
confused about the category of

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:45.480
experience that is running here that's

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.640
the question

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.400
I would argue that well you know what I

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.720
would argue so let's move on

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.560
okay

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:01.020
thanks for asking the question it's

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.920
really

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.440
the heart of

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.040
uh why I'm an iconoclast

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.040
and don't get asked to parties

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.460
okay

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:17.640
um I hate this thing here okay

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.300
so

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.960
this is basically one of the questions

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.380
uh this is basically behind some of the

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.920
inquiry that Sam brought up so there's

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.079
this cute little book I don't know if

00:39:34.079 --> 00:39:37.320
everybody knows John chosen bass was

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.540
given to me this weekend it says every

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.460
day

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.780
mindfulness of the goal it's actually a

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.940
very nice book unfortunately I'm going

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.060
to beat her up for a certain phrasing

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.680
um

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.500
so she's gonna describe she's going to

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:59.460
Define mindfulness and it's a fairly uh

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.040
um common description

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.460
[Music]

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.839
um uh

00:40:03.839 --> 00:40:07.200
uh who's that guy uh cobit whatever it's

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.740
a fairly con common District description

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.880
so

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.220
she says mindfulness is deliberately

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.740
paying full attention

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.560
to what is happening around you and

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.560
within you in your body heart and mind

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.099
okay

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.060
and I'm going to say

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:35.760
reflexive awareness

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.880
is attending to what is happening around

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:46.220
you with your body heart and mind

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.000
do you see the difference

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.579
what what should we do with the

00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:52.079
reflexive here

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:54.540
what what does it denote

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:58.320
this definition down here yeah why do

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.940
you choose the word reflect reflexive

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.220
because

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:02.960
um

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.680
reflexivity

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.740
is not reflection after the fact

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.320
it's it's awareness

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.760
in the present moment

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.700
it's just

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.560
it's just that word

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.960
um versus reflection reflection is

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:22.940
always

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.000
retrospective I reflect on something

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.640
reflexive is when there's awareness

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:34.920
and there's it's it's it's it's not

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.440
double Loop there's no temporal it's

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.260
kind of being holy

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.520
and fully

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.599
impregnated with experience

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.079
um

00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:55.500
yeah a long time ago I read Nicholas

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.859
Luman on systems social system Theory

00:41:58.859 --> 00:42:00.660
and he he made this distinction between

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.540
reflexive and reflective oh yeah it's a

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.579
long time ago so I I can't remember so

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:07.260
I'm just curious I just want to have a

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.780
yeah yeah I I remember it doesn't

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.000
doesn't mean much to me tomorrow yeah

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.339
yeah okay so if this is in the course

00:42:14.339 --> 00:42:18.060
content uh there is a social science use

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.400
of the word reflexive so they say the

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.260
market is reflexive which means

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.060
everything that happens pings off of

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.180
everything else uh I don't mean that so

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.380
just if the word doesn't uh work for you

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.980
just ignore it I'm just defining it

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.380
um but but let's look at the difference

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.079
between my I and I think this is a

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:42.720
correct uh definition of mind for us

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.940
it's deliberately paying full attention

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.599
so you're you're you're

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:52.260
it's it's quite concentrated and focused

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.720
to what is happening around you and

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.200
within you this is a problem because you

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.900
see you're running a simulation to

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.400
within you

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.619
is a simulation

00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:08.520
I'm looking with my mind in

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:11.880
my body heart and Minds okay my mind is

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.060
paying attention into my body heart and

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.300
mind

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.200
it's a simulation versus

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.400
attending to what is happening around

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.660
you with your body heart and mind

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.180
it's a certain use of your body heart

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.579
and mind that is attentive to what's

00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:35.099
around you

00:43:35.099 --> 00:43:37.200
whereas the first one on top of all that

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.980
there's a mind

00:43:45.359 --> 00:43:48.780
to feel the difference between these two

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.339
of course they call it mindfulness

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.319
right it seems like in the first one

00:43:55.319 --> 00:43:57.240
there's um

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.839
there's an in and out first of all

00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:01.680
there's a

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.680
a world inside that's somehow separate

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.599
from the world outside

00:44:06.599 --> 00:44:09.119
different and then there's an observer

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:10.740
that's

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.140
able to objectively look at the world

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.700
inside look at the world outside

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.099
so there's three things right there's

00:44:20.099 --> 00:44:22.140
the inside there's the outside and then

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.819
the thing that can see them both

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.319
the supervisor

00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:30.780
whereas in the second one

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.180
your body and heart and mind is

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.280
attending to what is happening around

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.500
you

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.839
and my question was the second one is

00:44:39.839 --> 00:44:41.940
what else would attend to what's

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.680
happening around you

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.920
sorry what's the question again so

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:49.500
attending to what's happening around you

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:52.079
with your body heart and mind what else

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:54.300
could be attending to what's happening

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.560
around you like

00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:06.720
or you could say

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.720
reflexive awareness is your body heart

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.079
and mind attending to what is happening

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:14.339
right

00:45:14.339 --> 00:45:17.520
but I wanted to kind of more mirror the

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.140
construction of her sure sure

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.400
there's no fragmentation it's it's

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.839
non-dual

00:45:27.839 --> 00:45:32.220
whereas mindfulness is very dualistic

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:35.819
yeah Bonnie I find anymore and this

00:45:35.819 --> 00:45:39.240
wasn't always the case but

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.319
when I get into hyper simulation

00:45:43.319 --> 00:45:45.780
and like that Hollow mirrors I

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.020
experience extreme anxiety

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.579
versus

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:53.339
um yeah attending with

00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:55.740
you know my intellectual Center feeling

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.319
Center and moving center

00:45:58.319 --> 00:46:00.720
um like I don't know what's real I don't

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.940
know what to trust I get um almost

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.300
panicky anymore

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.700
you mean when you're in your polymeras

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.480
yes it's infinite and there's no there's

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.920
no answer to it and and it's and it's

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.500
well I mean it's it's good script for

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.579
like

00:46:20.579 --> 00:46:22.160
cool

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.619
postmodern or meta modern movies but

00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:27.660
um it is the madness people live in we

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.240
live in a simulation and there's no

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.119
reality there there's no ground it's

00:46:33.119 --> 00:46:35.880
it's inherently aggressive Ingress

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.500
because he wants to know and then it

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.760
goes into Loops uh

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.680
um

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:45.119
yeah

00:46:45.119 --> 00:46:47.839
etc etc

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.220
couldn't hear you Samuel

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.819
excuse me

00:47:11.819 --> 00:47:14.280
yeah uh Bonita would you say like this

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:15.359
kind of

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:17.700
uh distinction you just made is kind of

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.660
uh that blinds uh this as a blind spot

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:23.880
um for the merging of predictive

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.280
processing like

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.319
it seems like the top one makes more

00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:32.099
sense in predictive processing model

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:35.099
yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah so

00:47:35.099 --> 00:47:38.540
productive processing is is valuable

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:43.020
because it it says as if the my the mind

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.079
is as if to my you know it's it's as if

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:48.119
the mind is a predictive processor and

00:47:48.119 --> 00:47:50.220
we can give give us some insights into

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.560
it but

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.240
um

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.160
the second one's more like what's

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.319
happening with Michael Levin you know

00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.780
like the genes aren't in control this is

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.579
not in control this is not actually

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:05.339
what's happening there's the cells are

00:48:05.339 --> 00:48:06.599
attentive to each other and they're

00:48:06.599 --> 00:48:08.579
communicating and they know what you

00:48:08.579 --> 00:48:12.240
know it's much more like bodies uh

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.839
bodies doing things like bodies and then

00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:18.900
we can abstract from that something that

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.319
seems computational or whatever but it's

00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:25.560
it's it's it's it's it's it's like

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.780
uh what did I say on Twitter the other

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.380
day when my when I am doing math is my

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:35.520
body doing math is my brain doing math

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.140
well

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.300
the computational theorists will say

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.540
your brain is doing maths it's running

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:46.260
Malaysian you know formulas uh Bayesian

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.319
formulas and stuff and I would say no

00:48:49.319 --> 00:48:53.119
actually my my brain is doing

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:56.520
something more like if you took pond

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.680
water and you looked at things growing

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.319
in the pond water and moving around

00:49:01.319 --> 00:49:05.099
actually my brain is doing

00:49:05.099 --> 00:49:09.900
something more like that than computing

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.359
do you understand that so far

00:49:12.359 --> 00:49:14.400
like when you see the neurons trying to

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.020
make connections and they grow and then

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:19.020
some it looks like Pond life it doesn't

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.240
look like computation

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.960
so when I meet Bonnie doing math it

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:27.420
triggers movement and activity in my

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.280
brain that actually looks like more like

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.400
what life does inside ponds

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.160
then what computational computers do

00:49:37.619 --> 00:49:41.760
however I can

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.700
create a computational model of the

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.700
brain we don't understand how Pond life

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.400
turns into

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.319
something that can be modeled

00:49:52.319 --> 00:49:55.579
computationally okay so when I am doing

00:49:55.579 --> 00:49:59.819
math my brain is not doing that it's

00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:02.700
alive like a pond okay

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.760
so when I am doing thinking my with

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.400
language my brain is not doing thinking

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.940
with language

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.339
it's moving around

00:50:13.339 --> 00:50:16.859
organic tissues and agents and glial

00:50:16.859 --> 00:50:21.540
cells and like we would see in the pond

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.760
it is kind of like this video of this

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.619
girl who has no inner monologue and she

00:50:25.619 --> 00:50:28.020
was explaining how she's sinking

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.300
I don't know I'm like I was this is like

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.099
all the time of my mind in a way yeah

00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:34.260
yeah and trying to like play with this

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.839
what what is this and and how this feels

00:50:36.839 --> 00:50:38.579
like and

00:50:38.579 --> 00:50:42.000
yeah I think I yeah kind of get in this

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.520
direction right so predictive processing

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.980
is a nice model it's as if this is

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.500
what's happening but really what's

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.740
happening it looks like Pond life and

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:57.420
this is a wonderful mystery of

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.819
of

00:50:59.819 --> 00:51:02.700
we'll talk about it I mean we just sent

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.200
the granting to try to get to write

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.020
about it but it's like it's like

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.079
here's another as if okay as if model

00:51:13.079 --> 00:51:15.960
it's as if the protocols at one level

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.339
which is me doing math

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.460
triggers procedures at another level so

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.520
the cells moving around and the

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.240
molecules and stuff are just procedures

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.880
so what is that interface where

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.619
protocols at one level turn into

00:51:34.619 --> 00:51:36.480
procedures

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.700
at another level

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:42.980
um is is an interesting question but but

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.819
it's a great question so yes so

00:51:46.819 --> 00:51:50.160
predictive processing is more like the

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:51.839
mental model of the first one that

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:56.099
something is pain is paying attention

00:51:56.099 --> 00:51:59.280
to the outside world making predictions

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.400
on the inside and kind of uh

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.940
adjudicating to the two uh was the one

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:09.000
on the bottom is more like

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.619
pond

00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:13.260
Pond life what's happening in your brain

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.079
a pond life I mean that's why your brain

00:52:16.079 --> 00:52:19.079
is so watery because because the things

00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:22.740
move around like organisms in a ponds

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.559
now this is not rocket science ever even

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:27.599
people who say predictive processing

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:29.760
will know will admit that if you looked

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.119
at the brain perceptual depth versus

00:52:32.119 --> 00:52:35.579
simulation model uh it looks like Pond

00:52:35.579 --> 00:52:37.880
life

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.140
they don't want to talk too much about

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.059
it but

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:46.339
it's not a it's not an unusual answer

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.660
yeah like I remember when you're seeing

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.960
when it was always the nerves and it

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.700
takes time the nurse to reach the brain

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.400
and then there's this Gap is

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.260
you would you could say it is a gap you

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:06.059
you don't experience immediately what's

00:53:06.059 --> 00:53:07.680
actually happening

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.420
but then you kind of said like this kind

00:53:09.420 --> 00:53:11.880
of distance or like this supposed

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.140
distance

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.960
it's like the Continuum is missing then

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.260
like that's that's like um

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:20.940
I don't know you said something that

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.460
well the nerve is the eye and and we

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.900
just perceive this

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.960
indirect word and then we're saying

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.480
no that's um

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:36.059
yeah so yes so when you go to sleep your

00:53:36.059 --> 00:53:38.520
Consciousness is in in you if you sleep

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.920
deeply your Consciousness is

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.680
discontinuous between then and when you

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.280
wake up right

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.660
your your conscious awareness right but

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:54.420
something still is conscious it's it's

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.859
not like

00:53:55.859 --> 00:53:59.040
you in what is still conscious what is

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.500
still working when you're sleeping is

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.940
your body

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.040
then we try to make a big mystery of it

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.559
like how is it that there's continuity

00:54:07.559 --> 00:54:10.260
how can how can you know this guy forgot

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.400
his name

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:13.859
he can go into

00:54:13.859 --> 00:54:16.380
Nirvana or whatever it's called you can

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.240
go into like hibernation for seven days

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.760
and he can or they can tell 90 minutes

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.339
and something keeps time it's not a

00:54:23.339 --> 00:54:25.859
mystery the body keeps time we we know

00:54:25.859 --> 00:54:27.599
this it has circadian rhythms it's got

00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.400
all kinds of oscillations that keep time

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.339
for different cells different hormones

00:54:32.339 --> 00:54:36.119
this and that so but but the Traditions

00:54:36.119 --> 00:54:37.920
don't want to say that like there must

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.839
be some Storehouse Consciousness that

00:54:39.839 --> 00:54:42.599
keeps time or something and and comes in

00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:44.400
and out of existence when it's so clear

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.099
it's like the body's the thing that that

00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:50.819
remains active while the Mind dips in

00:54:50.819 --> 00:54:51.780
and out

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.319
it's not rocket science

00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:58.339
it's a mystery about how these things

00:54:58.339 --> 00:55:02.460
how Pond life turns into all of this

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:05.220
brains and virtual reality and

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.619
philosophy

00:55:07.619 --> 00:55:08.900
um

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:13.880
baton's life turned into humans too

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.839
and this is something I think

00:55:18.839 --> 00:55:22.260
should be the preoccupation of the 21st

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.819
and 22nd century

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.339
the extraordinary

00:55:28.339 --> 00:55:32.220
intelligence of the natural world is

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.839
what we're dealing with here

00:55:41.819 --> 00:55:44.579
and it goes on and on I mean like we're

00:55:44.579 --> 00:55:46.920
talking about pure abstractions and the

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:50.780
honeybees dance is a pure abstraction

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.540
and the Rats can simulate hypothetical

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:57.500
environments all this stuff is very deep

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.599
deep in

00:56:00.599 --> 00:56:03.540
the levels let's say the ontological

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:06.660
levels of reality

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.660
um

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:13.200
they just don't pop into existence at a

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.640
level of emergence

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.040
Bonnie there's something about

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.440
prepositions

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.900
that

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:42.020
so aware of attending to

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:44.240
that

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:49.040
sets up that toggle for me

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.760
and

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.720
if I

00:56:53.819 --> 00:56:59.839
if I use as awareness as pain as

00:56:59.839 --> 00:57:03.119
seeing uh you know there's some there's

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:07.339
some language thing that happens

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.619
with the idea of

00:57:10.619 --> 00:57:14.579
what am I aware of like it's over there

00:57:14.579 --> 00:57:18.200
and then I have to come back

00:57:19.559 --> 00:57:25.460
if it's as breath or as

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.800
that feels much more connected in the

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.300
body

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.460
for me

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.619
yeah so the first question has that

00:57:34.619 --> 00:57:37.859
problem when I'm aware of when I'm aware

00:57:37.859 --> 00:57:42.000
so you're looking for a third thing

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.240
um and and it's in

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.000
my right

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.240
of and in you're aware

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.520
of the body as awareness or something

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.339
it's so this also brings us to something

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:59.339
else you know all all instructions all

00:57:59.339 --> 00:58:01.800
guided meditation pre

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.140
position you for certain insights and

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.220
not others

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.520
and and

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.140
what is useful let's say about this

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.960
module is that that you

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.940
agree with me

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:18.059
but that one day you will have an

00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:20.579
experience and you'll say ah it gives

00:58:20.579 --> 00:58:23.420
you permission

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:29.819
to consider this option

00:58:29.819 --> 00:58:32.119
um and and

00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:35.640
not canalize all your experience through

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.339
another option because it really is you

00:58:38.339 --> 00:58:41.839
know it's not something that

00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:44.819
it affords you

00:58:44.819 --> 00:58:47.760
the potential Insight

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.740
um

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.960
but it's not really worth

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:56.400
anything as just kind of you know

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.799
a teaching

00:58:58.799 --> 00:59:01.859
um it's it's it's it's an it's a open

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:05.160
it's an open proposition

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.160
that this might be the case

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.799
um which I happen to claim and believe

00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:17.000
and not not suspect I'm not suspect

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:21.720
what and then what happens is

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:26.040
we're what we're looking for is

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.700
a relate what is the relationship

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.900
between these

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.700
so

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.619
um

00:59:34.619 --> 00:59:37.559
in in a sense like Ian mcgilchrist says

00:59:37.559 --> 00:59:41.220
well the right brain is not just a pose

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.680
upon opponent processing to the left

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.099
brain

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:50.880
but the right brain includes it has its

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.579
own thing and it can see and include and

00:59:53.579 --> 00:59:55.380
envelop the left brain it can

00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.260
contextualize the left brain and what

00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.819
I'm saying is that

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:04.619
the body and mind aren't like this but

01:00:04.619 --> 01:00:05.880
the body

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.460
can see the mind

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:13.220
and includes and envelops it

01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:16.380
versus

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.420
either this or this one's above or you

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.640
know they're just equal and opposite or

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.619
ones above the other

01:00:25.619 --> 01:00:28.040
CIS

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:34.040
relation of uh in envelopment

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.020
that I would claim it it's it's more

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.059
like that

01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:41.119
um

01:00:47.099 --> 01:00:49.680
and you have to you know the whole thing

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.640
is hard to swallow in pieces as I'm

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.160
teaching in pieces

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.420
um because you have to in order to buy

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.520
into this

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.520
um

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.859
what is helpful is if you understand

01:01:07.859 --> 01:01:10.859
virtual perception

01:01:10.859 --> 01:01:14.460
as the evolution of our sensory motor

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.099
perception right so

01:01:17.099 --> 01:01:19.799
a sensory motor perception

01:01:19.799 --> 01:01:22.380
has uh

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.940
um two parts

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.520
it has an egocentric and an allocentric

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.740
subsystem

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:32.220
and when these when the virtual

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.440
perceptions become when the when the

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.000
sensory motor perceptions become

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.619
virtualized as they do in animals

01:01:40.619 --> 01:01:42.540
so animals can simulate their

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:45.359
environment to figure out how to solve a

01:01:45.359 --> 01:01:47.760
puzzle in the environment

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.440
um

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.460
then it gets virtualized in these two

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:57.059
subsystems the the subsystem

01:01:57.299 --> 01:02:00.720
structure is also virtualized

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.540
the egocentric virtual

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.960
patterns that are perceptions that are

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.240
patterns in your mind

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.260
um

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.760
run through the same systems that your

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.299
egocentric sensory X you just regular

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:22.140
perceptual Pro but they're microactions

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.599
right so your eyes go a little like this

01:02:24.599 --> 01:02:27.059
and your mouth goes a little like this

01:02:27.059 --> 01:02:31.559
and and you can actually see micro

01:02:31.559 --> 01:02:34.260
actions in Virtual perceptions

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.680
and the subsystem that becomes your

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.799
egocentric sensory motor subsystem that

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:43.020
becomes virtualized is your psyche so it

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.740
evaluates experience relative to you

01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:50.760
good bad is always reference to me

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.640
and your allocentric is what we call

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.579
your mind because it simulates things in

01:02:56.579 --> 01:02:58.559
the environment like Maps

01:02:58.559 --> 01:03:00.480
so you have this egocentric and you have

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.420
this allocentric thing Okay the reason

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.240
why I'm telling you this is because

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.640
this if you understand that then you

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.440
understand where the body envelops the

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.680
mind

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.720
because these sensory motor aspects of

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.720
your body become virtualized as a little

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.140
sub microactions

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.260
um

01:03:24.359 --> 01:03:26.940
and that's what we call psychian Minds

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:29.819
so the more you understand all the

01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:31.500
aspects of

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.359
what we've been going through the more

01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:36.180
you understand that

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.760
why the body envelops the mind and that

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.079
the mind envelops the body

01:03:42.299 --> 01:03:45.599
now I can convince you the mind envelops

01:03:45.599 --> 01:03:49.079
the body I'll do Alan B Allen Wallace

01:03:49.079 --> 01:03:51.920
he'll say

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.900
but to even ask that question

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.780
you have to use your mind

01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.180
and when he says that to me I notice I'm

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.880
in a simulation with him

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.260
and that's how I get them

01:04:14.339 --> 01:04:16.260
can you say more

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.380
because he says even to ask you that

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.359
question you have to be in your mind now

01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:23.280
I have a little mental model of of

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.339
course a test it's just everything that

01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:29.099
is now active in me is just in my mind

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:32.400
is a mental simulation

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.099
what it comes first the mind come has to

01:04:35.099 --> 01:04:37.500
come first because to us so thou is just

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.359
running a mental simulation of what's

01:04:39.359 --> 01:04:43.940
first and and it's outside of experience

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.940
and then he's got you

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:52.040
because you're entering his simulation

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.920
now if he when he argues with Penrose

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.140
Penrose says well you know the the big

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.079
bang was first and Alan Watts will say

01:05:01.079 --> 01:05:03.839
no in order to say that Consciousness

01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:05.339
has to be first

01:05:05.339 --> 01:05:07.859
well the Big Bang is a is a mental

01:05:07.859 --> 01:05:10.140
simulation too so

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.640
uh

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.079
you could you have to start with

01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:14.520
something like okay I'm sitting here and

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.180
you're sitting here

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.359
what do you notice oh I and like we

01:05:24.359 --> 01:05:28.220
started oh I can feel that that's a

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.099
we can enter we can enter a mental

01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:33.780
simulation called The Big Bang in

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.160
physics and all that it's very

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.380
profitable it's fun and it's interesting

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.180
we can enter a mental simulation about

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.960
consciousness

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.299
um

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.920
but if you need to feel that you're in a

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.260
mental simulation

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:54.599
that you're ex you that you're

01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:56.940
experiencing being in a mental

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:58.319
simulation

01:05:58.319 --> 01:06:01.680
or else you'd be like after you

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.240
've told each other where you're going

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.980
to put the plumbings you'd go and

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.559
in the toilet and you'd think it was all

01:06:07.559 --> 01:06:10.079
already

01:06:10.079 --> 01:06:13.079
done

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.920
it doesn't work that way

01:07:02.579 --> 01:07:05.640
I wanted to ask it is going into a

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.520
simulation that contagious

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.099
that if if somebody starts at

01:07:11.099 --> 01:07:13.020
communicating in a certain way to meet

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.420
in that Loop I'm gone

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.720
yeah it's contagious and like just

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.900
energetically when when like Magdalena

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.960
starts talking it's like contagious I I

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.420
meet I meet her where she's coming you

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:29.760
know like so

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.160
and so we and then you can get into Mass

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.900
hallucination and all this stuff but

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.599
just energetically like

01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:38.940
um uh that's why we like to watch our

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.220
pets running then we feel like

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.220
we feel like we're alive in our body so

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.940
we tend to track each other like what

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.260
energy is is is being emitted uh so yeah

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:55.500
I would say yes it's contagious

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.460
um and

01:07:58.799 --> 01:08:00.660
up to a certain point you know some

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.980
people

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.319
um if they're like real Galaxy brains

01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:05.700
and

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.160
people might get excited and then like

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.319
they can't then they're allergic to it

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:12.000
and they can't keep up and then the

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.339
opposite things happen you lose them and

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:16.080
uh

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.620
um but in in General within the

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.299
capacities that people share it's it's

01:08:21.299 --> 01:08:23.160
contagious

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.759
foreign

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.040
how do you feel about the word

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.560
dissociation here if I go off in

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.420
stimulation it

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.620
would direct dissertation apply or

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:39.960
so this isn't it no running a simulation

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.020
is not dissociation

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.819
um and even

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:47.040
um especially if you know you're running

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.980
a simulation okay so for example I know

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:51.900
we're running a simulation here you're

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:53.460
not sitting you're not a tiny little

01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.699
half person on my desk but whatever

01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.900
um

01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.160
um

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.219
um so so

01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:04.440
but

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.880
um

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.960
you can

01:09:09.299 --> 01:09:12.480
so what we mean by dissociation means

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.259
something in your experience becomes

01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:17.940
disassociated from your experience

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:22.799
so you we could be in metaphysical

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:25.380
like I've had this happen like me and

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.120
Tom Murray will go on these long drives

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.500
and we get into these metaphysical

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.299
discussions like I did this the other

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:31.259
day

01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:35.040
and I'm on Route 91 going north instead

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.080
of South because I'm pretty much

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.600
dissociated from the meaning making and

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.640
then I see this big sign welcome to

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.940
Canada and I swam on the brakes right so

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.400
so disassociating means that certain

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.679
aspects of your experience are are no

01:09:49.679 --> 01:09:51.600
longer associated with your experience

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.420
you know like in this case that this was

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.739
funny but

01:09:55.739 --> 01:09:59.100
when people go into disassociation like

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:01.140
that that term

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.120
um like one time I was in this we space

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.360
practice it was very intense and I just

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.300
I want my meaning making system was

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.640
exhausted and I was in this state where

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.800
I could see people's mouths move and

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.320
hear them talk but I had no idea

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.500
as like aphasic I had no idea what the

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.219
words meant so the meaning of words was

01:10:22.219 --> 01:10:25.860
disassociated from my experience

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.420
um and that would be what I just

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.460
described the classic case of what we

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.500
call disassociation

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:34.920
now this is a feature not a buck because

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.580
people with PTSD there's too much

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.400
Association in their experience you know

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.920
their their noise becomes associated

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.719
with so

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:50.520
I try to broaden uh this this this term

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.179
um to make it more precise

01:10:54.179 --> 01:10:56.699
um but yeah when you running simulations

01:10:56.699 --> 01:10:59.699
and like this joke I just this thing

01:10:59.699 --> 01:11:01.800
that happened with me and Tom

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.080
um you can

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.480
certain things that are normally online

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.420
and your experience can become take it

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.179
removed from experience

01:11:12.179 --> 01:11:14.719
um yeah

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.719
a lot of times in these spaces you know

01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:20.040
like

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.280
um uh in in ecstatic

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.040
States ecstatic dancing and stuff like

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.440
that which is not a simulation

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.739
um you you what gets disassociated is

01:11:31.739 --> 01:11:34.679
shame and then afterwards after you do

01:11:34.679 --> 01:11:37.199
something crazy this the your experience

01:11:37.199 --> 01:11:39.300
comes back and then you're like it's

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.580
very hard to like be proud that you did

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.800
that I mean everybody's looking at

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.420
everybody else you know this kind of

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:46.739
thing

01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:50.060
um so yeah

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.780
okay I'm fine with

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.260
um you know recap don't

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.940
um

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.060
being relegated there but there's

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.699
there's there's a part of me that was

01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:19.679
this thing

01:12:19.679 --> 01:12:22.880
um something about this distillation

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:26.040
because of the illusion of separability

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.940
I mean that anything is separable from

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.500
anything else really

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.520
and that's to me it's it's when you say

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.440
your body is the ground

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:45.380
how can

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.800
you you cut off you can't we can't hear

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.739
you you must have hit something to mute

01:12:52.739 --> 01:12:53.420
yourself

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:57.960
the body is right yeah if the body is

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.540
the ground of everything which I totally

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:02.280
went with you right there right there

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.560
right there rounds of awareness

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.260
ground of awareness yes my body doesn't

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:09.000
happen to be the ground

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.040
no no no the ground of aware of

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.199
everything we call awareness because

01:13:13.199 --> 01:13:16.159
even the word awareness is like

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:18.120
you know

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.020
um it's not a thing you know it's it's

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:27.000
you know this is why I I I I I go I go I

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.820
go I go and then I get to this moment of

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.120
like

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.659
yes

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.960
and then and then where did when we

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.620
start kind of like talking about it it

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.699
starts to separate again you know as if

01:13:44.699 --> 01:13:50.100
the ground the body is ground like how

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.560
could it be anything else

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.980
I mean what else do I have access to

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.280
um unless you know I'm I'm Dawkins and

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.280
I'm connected to all kinds of PODS you

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280
know I mean it

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.260
which is an interesting question what's

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.360
the

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.760
um some traditions that say your body

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.500
arises in your awareness

01:14:15.659 --> 01:14:19.820
so in a sense it's it's it's

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:21.600
a

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.739
condition of your mind and and there is

01:14:25.739 --> 01:14:28.860
some truth to that in the sense that you

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.620
know people who have body dysmorphia or

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.260
their their anorexic

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.739
[Music]

01:14:34.739 --> 01:14:40.500
they their bodies are distorted by their

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.280
their

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:47.300
perception of their bodies

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.760
so it gets very confusing that's I'm

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.100
just saying some people I'm just saying

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.320
there's a lot of people who would not

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.020
say that the body is

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.080
The Source or grounds of awareness

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.080
that there is this superordinate

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.360
thing of the universe called awareness

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.940
and your body arises in it like

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:11.600
everything else

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:17.760
but in general

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.179
taking the spiritual bent out of it most

01:15:21.179 --> 01:15:24.900
westerners do not believe that the body

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.739
is prior and envelops the mind

01:15:28.739 --> 01:15:31.260
for example you it would be impossible

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.480
to have body dysmorphia

01:15:36.179 --> 01:15:38.640
believed the body was prior to the

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.199
social construction of gender

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.320
the whole world has got it reversed

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.600
even if they would say oh of course the

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.100
bodies

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.480
primary but then you can say well I'm in

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.580
the wrong body well this is a social

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:58.260
construction

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:01.260
you know the the kids like to say well

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.460
gender is socially constructed but so is

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:07.980
lgbtq trans those are all socially

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.880
constructed too

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.800
and to get caught up in that is like

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:16.440
what Katie said is you're just like like

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.960
you can't see anything but socially

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:22.500
constructed and I'm saying that is

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.699
operating as if the body's in the mind

01:16:26.699 --> 01:16:30.000
that that the Mind includes and envelops

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.159
everything else this is maybe not a

01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:34.080
claim people would make but this is what

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.239
most people actually fundamentally

01:16:36.239 --> 01:16:39.060
believe

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.540
but that's how we've been conditioned I

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:45.239
mean again I I know I'm falling into the

01:16:45.239 --> 01:16:48.780
tautology of conditioning but I mean I

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.699
just found out I know that's why I have

01:16:50.699 --> 01:16:52.860
to spend hours trying to teach people

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.739
that it's ass backwards

01:16:55.739 --> 01:16:59.219
yeah and and and I don't get invited to

01:16:59.219 --> 01:17:01.620
parties because the parties people get

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.540
invited to are telling them something

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.239
like con you know your body arises and

01:17:06.239 --> 01:17:08.880
the world arises inside of consciousness

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.460
and the problem with that is that it

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.100
would be a cool idea except I believe

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.679
that's why we're destroying the Earth

01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:19.739
because we think that things like bodies

01:17:19.739 --> 01:17:23.100
and organisms and tissues and fabric

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:27.120
is somehow lesser than the ideas we have

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:28.440
about them

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.699
that's the problem

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.159
we like to use the metaphor you know

01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:37.140
when I was at Maple you know they used a

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.600
metaphor of you know they took a flower

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.480
and used a metaphor about it oh the

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.280
beautiful flower and then they want they

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.320
weren't cut you know mold down all the

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.840
flowers because they didn't want ticks

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:51.420
I'm like why is the metaphor of a flower

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.699
more appealing than the actual flowers

01:17:53.699 --> 01:17:57.000
and well it doesn't make any sense

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.580
we get all hyped on metaphors

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.460
and the beauty of the metaphors it comes

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.140
with like we actually really understand

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.560
how cool seeds and flowers are in their

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.020
generative nature but then we just live

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.239
with

01:18:11.239 --> 01:18:16.100
were satisfied living with the metaphor

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:21.179
it's it's it's ridiculous

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:23.659
yeah but that has to do with Harmony

01:18:23.659 --> 01:18:27.239
homogenization you know it's it's like

01:18:27.239 --> 01:18:32.420
because each each body and each com

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.699
constellation of everything that the

01:18:35.699 --> 01:18:40.460
pond life brain is is is so absolutely

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:43.980
unique and singular and it's come in

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.100
it's combination that it would not have

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:51.179
easily submitted to some kind of

01:18:51.179 --> 01:18:56.600
you know industrialized process at all

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.480
so I mean the conditioning I think has

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.179
to be brought I mean it's like my son he

01:19:03.179 --> 01:19:05.460
walked into my room one day five years

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:09.780
old he goes mom you know what's not fair

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.440
you said uh do you know tell me he said

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.260
that someone invented the word Fair

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:22.020
foreign

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.340
I mean we've made up words that we use

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:29.640
in this thing that we found that we make

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.219
with our throat that

01:19:32.219 --> 01:19:36.239
um are tonological I mean you know they

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:39.060
but this is an easy answer to that you

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.340
could show him the the experiment where

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:44.900
the chimps wouldn't take the the

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.460
Cucumber as a reward when their friends

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:50.040
were getting grapes and vice versa this

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.780
is it's not a word

01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:55.260
it's Entourage it's what what they call

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:57.620
anthro ontologically

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:02.280
grounded in our animal nature oh so

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.699
what's unfair is the way they use the

01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:08.640
word to distort what's fair or not fair

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.280
but let's look at where the word comes

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.580
from it comes from our animal nature

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:18.060
oh and look at the flowers do we see

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.420
fairness in ecology that's the answer to

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.239
it not to get all like post-modern

01:20:24.239 --> 01:20:26.940
linguistically like contortionist about

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:28.920
it

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:33.060
um this is this is again he's five years

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:36.239
old they you know the the the abstract

01:20:36.239 --> 01:20:40.380
mind is coming on faster and faster

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.360
um because we live under conditions

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.000
where things don't matter you don't have

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.260
to go

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.960
you know grow your food in this and that

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.960
there's no single Loop

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.159
experiences that children have anymore

01:20:53.159 --> 01:20:55.260
so that's that's something else to think

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.760
about

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.500
but

01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.760
um

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.760
I'm not trying to find the cause I'm

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.020
trying to

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:06.120
reverse

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.420
the process in in people I mean

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.400
ultimately why does it matter I mean I

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:12.719
think we're going to destroy just about

01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:16.520
everything anyways until

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.560
nature practically destroys us or

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:25.020
destroys us and then then life will get

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.420
on in a different way I don't think

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.300
we're gonna change really

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.360
um

01:21:32.699 --> 01:21:35.880
but for people who are here and happen

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:39.000
to be alive uh

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.820
if you can change

01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.540
your orientation to life

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:47.580
you will not only know you've been

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:51.600
robbed of the joy of life but you'll be

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.699
able to experience it again

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.620
and I would definitely invite you to my

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.440
parties

01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.640
[Laughter]

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.040
invite it

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.300
flat out

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:17.420
Algarve south of Portugal this comes

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:35.699
I should write a a series called Pond

01:22:35.699 --> 01:22:38.000
life

01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.860
I'm curious about why

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:50.900
awareness gets separated from

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.880
Aaron something is not working on your

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:54.960
your

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.920
microphone

01:23:02.699 --> 01:23:05.699
you're muted now you're unmuted but you

01:23:05.699 --> 01:23:06.840
have to like

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.760
it's very very very quiet

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.420
you know when you you can contact

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:58.739
thumbnail into pond life like this is

01:23:58.739 --> 01:24:01.020
why you know

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:05.159
certain narcotics and psychedelics

01:24:05.159 --> 01:24:08.940
work because it's like you know like

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:10.739
you're adding too much nitrogen to the

01:24:10.739 --> 01:24:13.020
pond or something I mean like you're

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:14.280
basically

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.980
changing the water in the pond and then

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.620
the activity changes you know like you

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:22.159
could think of

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:31.500
like if you throw if you throw corn into

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.659
the pond then all the like fish go like

01:24:33.659 --> 01:24:37.699
this you know you're always

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
these things trigger like different

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.460
life

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:47.100
procedures in your pond the pond of your

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.340
mind

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.440
and we use that term polluted you know

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.940
he got polluted last night

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.380
Pond is polluted

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.420
I'm stuck on something and if it's not

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:14.400
helpful just cut me off or if I'm just

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.199
showing that I don't get it then instead

01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:18.239
but you said

01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:22.040
um veronic simulation here now

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.679
um so so where is my body for example I

01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:27.840
can ask where is Bonnie that that's over

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.020
there

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.360
um

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.760
what's the difference between a

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.560
simulation of Bonnie that I'm running

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.900
and is there any way not to be in a

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.760
simulation here

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.420
with you

01:25:44.699 --> 01:25:46.920
um in this context but you you mentioned

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:50.520
the zoom thing yeah so

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.920
um right so this is I use it because

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:55.440
simulations aren't bad because if we

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.840
want all simulating this we need very

01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.940
confused

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.520
like I would hear something I'm like

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.800
what where's that man's voice coming

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.560
from I mean I think it would be very

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:12.420
confusing if we weren't simulating

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:16.280
a room and people in the room and and

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.199
carrying it together

01:26:18.199 --> 01:26:23.639
if I had to track this experience as

01:26:23.639 --> 01:26:26.639
code and pixels and electrons and this

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:30.900
and that it'd be very hard for me to

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:33.600
have any bandwidth to participate in

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.980
this way so the shorthand is we run a

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.199
simulation together

01:26:40.199 --> 01:26:43.920
and when I hear you talk I'm I'm not

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.239
like

01:26:45.239 --> 01:26:49.620
you know what I mean I'm not confused uh

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:56.639
um I normalize it in inside a theory and

01:26:56.639 --> 01:27:00.659
um and I allow we it's very easy just to

01:27:00.659 --> 01:27:03.300
simulate it and and makes it very easy

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.420
for us to do this just like again the

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:09.480
two plumbers trying to figure out

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.520
and someone says oh we need you know one

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.880
of those four ways and then I I see in

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.380
my mind that that's going to have a

01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:22.620
four-way and and and it's it's very easy

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:25.020
inconvenient

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:29.300
to be able to do that as as people

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.800
yeah so but it's also the case in a

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.639
physical meeting yes okay but the weird

01:27:35.639 --> 01:27:37.380
thing about this is not everything

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:40.020
that's even before we get to talk we

01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.520
have to run a simulate you know

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:45.239
simulation so this is not

01:27:45.239 --> 01:27:46.380
um

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:49.260
this one okay the interface of this

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:53.219
simulation is so beautiful that I ca I

01:27:53.219 --> 01:27:55.260
don't even feel the effort of running a

01:27:55.260 --> 01:27:56.520
simulation

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.300
however it is true that people get Zoom

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:03.420
fatigue and it's and

01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:05.880
um they've done some experiments on it

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.060
and and we think it's because there is

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.980
some

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:14.280
some running effort to to you know I

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.960
can't experience this too much as a

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.440
simulation but apparently there is some

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.699
effort needed required cognitive effort

01:28:22.699 --> 01:28:25.500
uh for us to

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:29.060
run this as a simulation

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.120
it's interesting because the trade-off

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.920
is we're so social we have so much

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.260
Social Anxiety that there's a lot of

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.060
effort for us to talk to each other face

01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.860
to face

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:44.400
versus the effort to run a simulation

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.120
like this

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.620
sometimes you know when we were doing

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:56.120
the four posture meditations

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.639
I was doing them too and I I and then

01:28:59.639 --> 01:29:01.980
we'd come back after the 20 minutes and

01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.639
it was really I had to like slap myself

01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:08.940
into being like it just seemed so weird

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:11.580
like I like what is like it just seems

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.980
like a TV show or something I couldn't

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:15.960
and I had to like

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.440
wake myself up and reboot the simulation

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.120
because I'd been in the like really

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.780
perceptual Zone you know

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.219
uh and

01:29:26.219 --> 01:29:28.320
and then I would let that

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.780
I would let that be the case for a while

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.719
and like you know this is it just seems

01:29:33.719 --> 01:29:36.139
so weird

01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:39.300
looking at a screen

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.380
um so sometimes that toggles for me

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:46.560
I think you don't seem like people

01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:49.560
yeah I feel like in this course

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:51.440
um through this reflectivity practices

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:54.179
again I'm trying like I'm entering in

01:29:54.179 --> 01:29:55.620
like I'm playing with it all the time

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.460
but I think as I just I feel like I

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.360
experienced what you just explained

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.820
sometimes like when I'm then I just see

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:05.340
the screen in front of me

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:08.820
then yeah I think I think I think I know

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.719
what you meant there yeah

01:30:11.719 --> 01:30:14.280
in the previous modules just like this

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.440
one uh at least I noticed that

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.699
yeah

01:30:17.699 --> 01:30:20.100
and that's that's when you can tell that

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.260
there is some effort in running the

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:24.320
simulation but in general

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.520
it's not it's not that

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.040
it's not that hard to hijack or

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.840
simulations you know so

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.880
uh

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.580
like can you imagine

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.020
I'm sure they're gonna make this movie

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:42.120
can you imagine really going through

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.340
like like let's say Collective

01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.400
presidency and being with people and

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:50.400
really going through all this pain and

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.699
suffering and then one day you just it's

01:30:53.699 --> 01:30:56.340
like it's like the Jim Carrey in that

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:59.100
show what was that show that what was

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:02.100
that show family uh yeah and then one

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:05.040
day someone shows you oh they're just

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.219
they were just you know AI it was just a

01:31:08.219 --> 01:31:10.080
big simulation

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:13.679
can you imagine like

01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:16.500
what a nightmare

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:21.860
I've met Sandra and Katie and Aaron

01:31:23.639 --> 01:31:26.040
so

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.280
doesn't mean that but anyways so that's

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.739
the stuff of like cuckoo right we have

01:31:31.739 --> 01:31:34.040
to

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:40.920
yeah but look at what you just did you

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.560
just said I've met Sandra I've met I

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:46.620
mean you know it's it's like it's gonna

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.040
take that kind of

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.020
um

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.460
I don't know I have trouble with the

01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.400
word simulation because I mean it's

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.280
etymology is imitation so what is this

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:02.540
imitating exactly

01:32:04.199 --> 01:32:07.020
did you understand the story of the two

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:09.440
plumbers

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.139
instead of them going and taking a pipe

01:32:13.139 --> 01:32:14.699
and then another thing and then yeah

01:32:14.699 --> 01:32:17.820
yeah that's what a simulation is you

01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.920
simulate a hypothetical environment

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:21.659
that's all yeah but if you talk about

01:32:21.659 --> 01:32:24.179
Plumbing I mean it's like

01:32:24.179 --> 01:32:26.639
yeah absolutely

01:32:26.639 --> 01:32:30.719
um but I don't know if all Realms can be

01:32:30.719 --> 01:32:33.659
reduced to a plumbing Story I mean

01:32:33.659 --> 01:32:35.880
simulation works the same way no matter

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:39.360
how complex flexes the same thing you're

01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:42.300
just running a simulation so what is

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:43.980
this simulating

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.679
this experience we're having that there

01:32:46.679 --> 01:32:48.780
are people real people in the room that

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:51.500
I'm talking to

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:55.020
and not that like if I wasn't running a

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.420
simulation and I heard William in my

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.139
head I'd be like

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:05.040
I'd be all freaked out

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:07.139
but

01:33:07.139 --> 01:33:09.780
I'm simulating that there's a man will

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:13.639
have somewhere in a room talking to me

01:33:13.639 --> 01:33:15.920
we

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.820
enjoy this simulation

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.420
trusting it in fact it could be

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:26.820
otherwise

01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:30.600
as we just said but I think I think the

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.699
fact that you said the word trust is

01:33:32.699 --> 01:33:35.280
very important yeah because we're trying

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:38.100
we're running a shared simulation and

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:41.340
and yeah it's and it's running

01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:44.699
effortlessly because I'm not except when

01:33:44.699 --> 01:33:48.659
as Samuel just said sometimes when we we

01:33:48.659 --> 01:33:53.159
did those exercises I come back and I

01:33:53.159 --> 01:33:55.620
don't the simulation isn't isn't running

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.600
and I feel like well there's a screen in

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.340
front of me I can't boot up the interest

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.639
I can't feel you guys there I can't

01:34:02.639 --> 01:34:05.580
and I just think I just feel this very

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:08.100
flat weird thing that I'm talking to a

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.620
screen that's because the simulation

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.420
wasn't running when I was in that deep

01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:14.940
meditation and then I have to like

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:18.060
oh yeah oh yeah these are people I have

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:19.380
to

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:23.760
I have to supply in my own body what

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.580
would be supplied to me by your body

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.440
that's the effort of running the

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:30.480
simulation

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.420
so if the simulation

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:35.280
um like some of the collective

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:37.380
presencing that we've done in breakout

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:40.320
rooms which is deeply moving and and

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.360
feels intimate

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.460
if you realize that I played a joke on

01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:47.900
you and those were just AIS

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.219
could I run simulation on you

01:34:56.219 --> 01:34:58.260
that could that tell I'm telling you

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.120
that's hap that's coming down the pipe

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:02.699
I'm not doing it but

01:35:02.699 --> 01:35:07.080
no I mean I guess I I'm I'm refusing

01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.460
you know the the main pipeline

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:14.040
um uh to be fear you know and and if we

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.260
are to say that absolutely everything

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:19.020
that's on the planet is of this planet

01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:23.400
that has entered modalities okay and we

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.340
can't really separate

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:27.260
um

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:30.239
you know what does the word artificial

01:35:30.239 --> 01:35:32.760
really mean and I'm not trying to be say

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.679
everything is a simulation

01:35:34.679 --> 01:35:37.620
I'm saying we need to be aware of when

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.659
we're running simulations or else

01:35:39.659 --> 01:35:42.300
they'll run us

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.179
okay excellent I love it

01:35:44.179 --> 01:35:46.739
if you can be aware of running a

01:35:46.739 --> 01:35:50.520
simulation it means you're not in one

01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.840
but

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.080
you're cantankerous and ornery today

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:58.560
oh no no it's just that the the intimate

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:01.820
realm around here from a kind of

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.800
organizational standpoint is blowing up

01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:07.500
and I didn't get to go in the woods and

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.020
dance and cry and been jealous I had to

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:13.320
be here so I'm stimulating uh my

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:16.620
participation somewhat but also very

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.380
hungry right right

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.300
exactly I wasn't suggesting that be

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.520
paranoid about this experience I was

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.800
just saying that pond life is running

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.679
simulation I know that's what's so

01:36:28.679 --> 01:36:34.199
amazing it's the you know right

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:39.679
okay Pond life running simulations

01:36:39.679 --> 01:36:42.500
forgetting it's running simulation

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.300
I hope the next time you talk you're

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.300
with Michael Taft or you can and you and

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.580
you start meditating all you can see is

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:54.020
like Pond life

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:57.600
how much time are you doing this it's a

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:01.139
it's a freaky it's freaky it's real but

01:37:01.139 --> 01:37:02.820
it's freaky I think it's beautiful

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.600
freaky

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.580
it's better than the metaverse

01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.920
it's better than the metaverse like it's

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.280
already too much what is well back to

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.380
the pollution right I mean you call it

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.199
pollution but like pollution is the

01:37:19.199 --> 01:37:22.320
emergence of something I mean of

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.199
something potentially novel that we

01:37:25.199 --> 01:37:26.159
couldn't

01:37:26.159 --> 01:37:29.000
predict

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.179
so let me give you an example

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.699
so horses

01:37:47.699 --> 01:37:48.900
um

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:52.620
don't have two stomachs and they can't

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:59.900
digest cellulose which is what hay is

01:38:01.739 --> 01:38:05.219
so how how do they survive how do they

01:38:05.219 --> 01:38:07.980
get their nutrients well horses guts

01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:12.060
have a very complex microbiome of all

01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.739
these different bacteria

01:38:13.739 --> 01:38:17.400
and the bacteria digests the legumes

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.139
and they release a fermentation project

01:38:22.139 --> 01:38:23.820
products

01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:28.679
that then the horses can digest this is

01:38:28.679 --> 01:38:31.560
why they also get fat on beer if you

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.060
have an underweight horse you can feed

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:36.000
them Guinness Scouts

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.699
um so

01:38:38.699 --> 01:38:41.880
so they're basically what a horse's

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.980
digestive system is they basically a

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.780
horse is a Rancher and they Ranch

01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.260
different gut biomes right this is why

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:51.060
if you have a horse and you feed them

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:53.340
the exact same thing every day for 10

01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:54.900
years and then it goes to a different

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:58.260
bomb he can die if the feed changes

01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:00.840
because you've selected for a single

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.239
microbiome and he doesn't have a complex

01:39:03.239 --> 01:39:06.179
Ecology of Flora and in the wild they

01:39:06.179 --> 01:39:08.520
eat a lot of different things right so

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.460
This Is How They so the the horses don't

01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:18.719
actually eat the food they eat they eat

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:21.739
the little micro

01:39:21.739 --> 01:39:24.300
organisms that they Ranch

01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:28.139
okay so what what it looks like eating

01:39:28.139 --> 01:39:31.560
is feeding they feed

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.300
they're not eating the hay they're

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:36.060
feeding them to their microorganisms

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:39.320
does that make sense

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:43.440
so that's a little bit of aversion like

01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.320
a pond life like their guts is like Pond

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.199
life and then they

01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:51.780
it turns into horse

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:55.080
like and this is something similar

01:39:55.080 --> 01:40:01.280
between Pond life and human life

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:16.739
it's also why in meditation you get to

01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:20.820
this point where you realize you don't

01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.000
um

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:26.219
you don't initiate your thoughts you can

01:40:26.219 --> 01:40:29.219
actually start to see them arise and

01:40:29.219 --> 01:40:32.060
where do they come from

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.900
this is this is

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.719
you know in that book the answer was 42

01:40:39.719 --> 01:40:42.780
and of course the answer is always Pond

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:44.610
life

01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:47.780
[Music]

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.780
[Music]

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:04.020
and then this of course is in I'm going

01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:05.460
to try to come back to the course

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:09.360
content and that we call reflection

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.440
and we said reflection has two meanings

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.199
it has a

01:41:16.199 --> 01:41:18.060
trivial meaning which is when you

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.920
reflect on something after the fact

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.679
right retrospective sense making but

01:41:22.679 --> 01:41:25.739
then there is a spiritual meaning that

01:41:25.739 --> 01:41:28.199
the inner and all outer worlds are

01:41:28.199 --> 01:41:31.139
perfect reflections of each other

01:41:31.139 --> 01:41:32.880
so think about that the next time you

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.199
look at a real pond

01:41:40.619 --> 01:41:43.940
it's not a metaphor

01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:00.480
it's what you know

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:03.300
at Master Eckhart said the eyes that

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:06.179
look for God are the eyes

01:42:06.179 --> 01:42:08.100
that God is looking with or something

01:42:08.100 --> 01:42:11.159
right so this is the you look at the

01:42:11.159 --> 01:42:12.840
poem you said the eyes that are looking

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.540
at the pawn

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:17.699
by the eyes that the pond is looking

01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:18.900
with

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:22.139
it's just there's two different ponds

01:42:22.139 --> 01:42:24.360
or maybe they're the same

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.159
because there's actually no separation

01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:28.580
but

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.900
this is perfect reflection

01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:43.340
why does it feel so sweet

01:42:45.659 --> 01:42:48.260
what

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.480
your mom

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:55.800
[Music]

01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.960
I didn't hang up on my mom like that

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:09.300
I wanted to ask why does it feel so soup

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:11.460
I wanted to ask why does it feel so

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.760
super good in my body when you say the

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:18.360
answer to everything here is a pond or

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.580
Pond life

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:22.679
something happens in my body

01:43:22.679 --> 01:43:25.739
and it's it's a good feeling and it's

01:43:25.739 --> 01:43:28.080
but and it's better than like getting an

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:31.020
ice cream or winning the lottery it's a

01:43:31.020 --> 01:43:35.360
different quality of feeling really good

01:43:36.719 --> 01:43:39.600
hey can you follow my question yeah I

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:42.900
mean that's great it's a biomarker I

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:44.820
would say no separation you know we're

01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:48.360
dying of the the basic uh problem we

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.820
have is we feel separate

01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:54.360
and that we don't belong and

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.659
this feeling of

01:43:57.659 --> 01:43:59.580
finding home or something I mean you

01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:02.100
might have other words for it but the

01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.239
sense of or the truth sense is sometimes

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:08.219
used as a word

01:44:08.219 --> 01:44:09.480
um

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.260
and

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.080
the obviousness of the

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.139
holistic entanglement of everything

01:44:22.139 --> 01:44:24.260
um

01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:43.320
it's interesting how like

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.179
I mean I've never

01:44:45.179 --> 01:44:47.880
this phrase I've never used before and

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:51.679
it came from Samuel's question about

01:44:51.679 --> 01:44:55.080
predictive processing

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.199
um

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.480
and that thing I said on Twitter what is

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:03.119
my brain doing when I when I'm doing

01:45:03.119 --> 01:45:06.619
math it's not doing math

01:45:07.739 --> 01:45:10.260
what's interesting about it is that it's

01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:13.020
a very obvious answer

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:15.780
that what your brain is doing is I mean

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:17.520
it wouldn't have been obvious years ago

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.440
but we have

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.480
all kinds of technology to

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:26.940
you know uh the perceptual depth just to

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.360
look at neurons in

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.000
you know in in

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.080
yeah

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.860
so

01:45:38.219 --> 01:45:39.800
you know you could say there's also

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.820
electrical happening but like Michael

01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:43.580
Levin's work is like that's what

01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.780
microorganisms are doing in ponds they

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.699
have Gap Junctions and there's

01:45:47.699 --> 01:45:50.639
bioelectric communication happening and

01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:52.260
stuff like that so we're getting closer

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.540
and closer to actually understanding the

01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:56.719
the

01:45:56.719 --> 01:46:01.940
isomorphism of pond life and brains

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.760
okay another obnoxious question the fact

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:23.639
that we use you know these very very

01:46:23.639 --> 01:46:26.400
sophisticated microscopes in order to

01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:29.820
see and observe what Michael Evans

01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:33.659
talking about and that obviously most

01:46:33.659 --> 01:46:37.380
people 10 years ago didn't even know or

01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:40.440
have access to that information

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:40.980
um

01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:41.880
um

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:45.179
you know is is the

01:46:45.179 --> 01:46:47.040
um

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:50.940
um good feeling that villain was talking

01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:54.659
about that comes from you know the pond

01:46:54.659 --> 01:46:56.400
life

01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.520
um

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:07.739
does it need to come from these these

01:47:07.739 --> 01:47:09.900
things that we didn't have access to 10

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.179
years ago or

01:47:12.179 --> 01:47:15.840
are there other ways of

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.880
and I'm not going to go to indeed all

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.699
indigenous or anything here but

01:47:20.699 --> 01:47:22.760
um

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:30.800
that inseparability

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.020
does it need that argument does it need

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:41.960
the micro ovens or is it possible to

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:44.719
um

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:49.980
I think it is

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:52.260
I mean I think it happens sometimes in

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:55.560
like poetry you know there's there's

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.860
something

01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:00.780
um right I mean I think we have people

01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.480
have the suspicion or this this knowing

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.440
that

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.780
that is like that's notion of perfect

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.940
reflection in the spiritual Traditions

01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.400
but it's just I'm just saying it's it's

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.080
we're at the point in history where it's

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.980
just obvious

01:48:16.139 --> 01:48:17.520
um

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.980
I mean there's no nothing in the

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:22.260
spiritual Traditions that says your mind

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.600
is like a pond but

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:30.619
um but this has become very obvious

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.560
um

01:48:38.219 --> 01:48:40.440
you know what's interesting that um

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.400
before we understood about the brain the

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.040
the reason why they thought the heart

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.619
was where their mind was

01:48:49.619 --> 01:48:52.739
is because they understood that

01:48:52.739 --> 01:48:55.739
the heart pumped uh blood to all the

01:48:55.739 --> 01:48:58.020
extremities and back and they understood

01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:00.619
that there needed to be a central

01:49:00.619 --> 01:49:03.780
feature that had contact with the whole

01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.060
periphery of the body and they could

01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:08.040
they couldn't see the nervous system

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:11.159
when they dissected it so they actually

01:49:11.159 --> 01:49:13.500
were looking for something that

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.900
functioned you know like the the brain

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.260
has effort and afferent now it turns out

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.360
that both are true that the blood

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.020
circulation is also

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:28.639
bioelectrically active so you have

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:31.860
yeah and then the and then

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:33.900
the respiratory system the same thing

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:36.480
you have centers that

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.760
air collects and then goes out to the

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:40.619
whole body blood collects and goes out

01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:42.900
to the whole body the centralized

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:44.699
nervous system collects information and

01:49:44.699 --> 01:49:48.540
goes out so we have these three organs

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:50.580
of

01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.780
um

01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:54.540
you could think of a digestive system as

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:56.580
all these up hierarchies you know that

01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.040
have access to the periphery which goes

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.920
out into the world and then

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:04.920
centralizes and there's many systems

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.800
like that but at first they thought the

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:11.820
heart and the circulatory system was

01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:13.219
the the

01:50:13.219 --> 01:50:16.260
what we now call the brain right the

01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:18.960
centralization of

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.900
information because they knew it had to

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:25.199
be something that had access to

01:50:25.199 --> 01:50:27.420
touch and say you know the whole body

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:30.060
and then centralized or Central

01:50:30.060 --> 01:50:32.780
organization

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:51.420
alrighty

01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:59.600
myself

01:51:01.199 --> 01:51:05.119
I shouldn't have used that word

01:51:43.159 --> 01:51:46.380
simulating simulation for the record

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:49.739
Bonnie you're invited to my party too

01:51:49.739 --> 01:51:52.320
and we're going to jump in puddles

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:55.760
got plenty of Puddles up here

01:52:05.639 --> 01:52:09.000
okay so now we'll end with a when it

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.699
ends with a kind of a mind Cohen

01:52:11.699 --> 01:52:14.340
it's it's this is not this is just

01:52:14.340 --> 01:52:16.139
something

01:52:16.139 --> 01:52:18.420
to torture your mind if you want to

01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:20.340
think about it so

01:52:20.340 --> 01:52:23.699
we said that the the what's in my head

01:52:23.699 --> 01:52:25.440
is just a pond

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.199
what if we reversed it and we saw the

01:52:28.199 --> 01:52:33.739
pine as cerebral spinal fluid

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:38.540
would there be an intelligence in there

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.960
see how I flipped it

01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.139
this is what we have to talk about when

01:52:46.139 --> 01:52:50.239
we come back in the fall is is

01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:55.400
when do collections

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:59.040
become the next level

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:02.040
awareness

01:53:13.219 --> 01:53:17.580
there's a pond a real literal pond have

01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:22.619
a superordinate awareness

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.980
the way our

01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:28.980
pond in our skull has a subordinate

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:31.520
awareness

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:36.739
it's a freaky question

01:53:42.719 --> 01:53:44.340
but that

01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:47.280
might be what my goal attack is trying

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.760
to say

01:53:57.119 --> 01:54:00.020
but I don't know

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.880
his Twitter Handle by the way is what

01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.619
Michael Taps simulation

01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.800
so we're going to dedicate this session

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:16.639
to you Michael

01:54:18.199 --> 01:54:20.280
good work

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.119
laughs


## Cohort 6

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.860
foreign

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.700
okay

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.000
uh welcome for the final installment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.839
of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.240
um the module on awareness reflection

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.660
reflexivity and awareness

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.779
um

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.719
we're going to go into uh breakout

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.899
groups to generate

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.660
um some Reflections and questions hi

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.280
Eric nice to see you

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.600
um just you know Aaron we're going to do

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.940
a recap of all these sessions starting

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.600
net they've already told you right so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.899
um yeah so this will be kind of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.579
interesting for you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.780
um cool thank you yeah

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.960
um

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.520
so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.939
um we basically just made some

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.100
distinctions in this module we have

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.340
something called reflection

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.180
it's there's a trivial uh meaning of the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.280
term which means you reflect on

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.740
something after the fact you make sense

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
retrospectively

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.759
um

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.080
and then we have this term reflection

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.240
that has a spiritual kind of term that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.000
we've been playing with when you'll read

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.659
that the mind is a perfect reflection of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.200
the world or the world is a perfect

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.600
reflection of something else what does

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.659
that mean there's this this spiritual

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.600
meaning that we've been playing with so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.060
that's that word

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.520
and then we're talking about this thing

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.240
called reflexivity and it's not a good

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.759
word for everyone wilham in German it's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.220
not a good word because we don't mean

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.740
something like reflexivity of the market

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.780
which means when one thing moves all

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.340
these other things move

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.180
we mean attending to all of one's

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.580
experience in the moment so you're kind

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.560
of how much

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
can you be aware of in the moment and

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.220
reflects it without oscillating like

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.580
first like usually what happens to us

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.580
I'm aware maybe that you're getting mad

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.220
and then I'm aware that I'm I go inside

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.379
and I have internal dialogue and then

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.140
usually we jump around and reflexivity

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.500
is can you have a Gestalt

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.620
uh that's aware of time and space and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.840
you're internally external as a Gestalt

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.099
instead of all these different

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.500
oscillations that we might have

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.120
and

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.239
um Kim described last time

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.099
um when she and her dog were on a walk

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.980
and they ran into a bear and a lot of

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.840
things were online

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.680
at the same time not a distraction so

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.459
um

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.940
and then we have this term so that's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.920
reflexivity and then there's this term

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.180
awareness that we've been working with

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.940
um that we're going to return to a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.760
little bit today and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.879
um

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.019
yeah so we'll we'll be we'll be working

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.459
with that are there any questions about

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.260
these three

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.239
units or

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.099
um something that we've done

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.459
last week or in the in in the videos

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.560
that you've watched or certainly clarify

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.940
clarifying questions David

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.000
please

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.340
I had a sense you were excited there was

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.159
a question maybe even me questioning

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.200
anyway

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.940
um

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.700
when I was cramming this morning um the

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.940
reason I raised my hand was to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.640
um share an additional element to this

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.980
module which is recursivity

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.819
okay okay

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.699
do it and the part the part that I'm

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.900
just starting to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.900
integrate is

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.520
getting a

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.360
a really a a visceral sense of what

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.919
infinite regression is not a rational

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.139
sense because I can't figure that out

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.360
right but I can feel

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.520
nature being reflected back and forth

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.500
and back and forth in the twinness

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.680
that feels real to me

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.639
and

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.340
recursivity the loop of returning back

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.759
to something

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.040
stops pauses

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.120
attending to the vastness of what what

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.060
we really are when we're in this River

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.699
of Life

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.639
so that's what I wanted to share yeah so

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.860
it's an important it's very important

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.380
to sit out because

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.060
because but um

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.060
um yeah so nature pings on itself pings

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.039
on itself pings on itself there's this

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.380
beautiful thing when people are doing

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.360
awareness practice

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.940
you can tell you're in your head or

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.919
you're running a simulation if you get

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.340
this Loop I'm aware that I'm aware now

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.440
what's aware that I'm aware that I'm

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.180
aware and that and there's there's some

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.000
versions of that that are less obvious

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.160
but

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.280
um but

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.100
that's a signature of when the mind is

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.280
trying to work with very abstract

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.320
Concepts

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.740
um it it it it gets in this Loop so I

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.560
talked about this famous conversation

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.259
that Roger Penrose had with B Allen

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:17.280
Wallace

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.800
where Roger Penrose was saying well we

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.060
know

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.699
the the fundamental origin of the

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.120
universe is the big bang and B Alan

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.819
Wallace says well you can't say that

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.919
because that's a thought that arises in

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.780
Consciousness so you have to first say

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.699
there's Consciousness before you can say

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.000
there was a big thing and they just Loop

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.740
over and over and over and over again

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.180
and so

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.960
um

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.080
um that's recursivity and a lot of

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.259
meditators if they're working too much

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:53.400
they get stuck with mental phenomenon uh

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.080
they'll get into the witness and then

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.759
wonder how can I see the then the

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.979
witness pops up out and then they wonder

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.560
how can I witness the witness well there

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.039
must be a witness behind the witness

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.919
so this is a a strange Loop that the

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.560
Mind does and it doesn't it's not

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.539
interesting it doesn't lead anywhere

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.419
what's interesting is to feel the Mind

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.600
pop and and pretend there's a

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.740
another viewer here but that's just

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.800
um what did I say the other day what's

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.479
actually happening is you're just

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.699
witnessing thoughts the thoughts are

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.319
getting more complex

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.720
so the first thought is there's a

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.220
witness

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.440
and then this then the second thought is

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.259
a witness witnessing a witness so you're

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.660
not really

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.300
you you're not taking stances that are

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.160
have any more depth it's just what

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.780
you're looking at the thought you're

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.780
working with is getting more complex

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.319
you're not somehow accessing deeper and

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.520
deeper levels of awareness your your

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.000
your working with a mental phenomenon

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.520
that's increasingly getting increasingly

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.800
complex in this stupid kind of stupid

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.400
way you see the difference yeah

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.680
so the construction of the mental model

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.080
is gives you the impression that you're

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.300
ontologically moving through some kind

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.680
of

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.440
depth but it's just the the mental

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.120
phenomenon the construction of the

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.220
thought itself has gotten more complex

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.819
that's it

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:37.399
that's recursivity it's it's um

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.800
it can lead to kind of it can lead to

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.740
psychosis you can see how psychosis is

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.380
recursive because I think you're doing

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.480
something and then you think and it just

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.060
goes back and forth like that so

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.100
um that's that's a normal thing for the

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.620
mind to do when it's

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.380
confused about the stance it takes when

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.120
it looks at

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.459
thoughts or phenomena in its own mind

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:06.120
yeah uh Joe or Katie

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.040
that is Katie

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.880
um actually I wanted to ask about uh

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.820
psychosis and recursion

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.940
um

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.040
just hearing you guys talk about this

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.360
um let me see if I can bring it back

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.339
because I had a way of thinking about it

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.740
that might have been helpful

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.480
um so

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.220
your mind is a reflection of what's

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.440
going on in nature and what you see in

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.060
nature is a reflection of what's going

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.959
on in your mind psychosis Maybe

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:39.959
could we see it as something like

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:42.779
the side like the internality the

00:09:42.779 --> 00:09:44.580
subjective experience what's going on in

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.680
your mind is so powerful that it is

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.980
imposing more and more of itself on on

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.860
what it's reflecting to where it like

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.160
loses like ground connection and then

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.800
this becomes a recursive Loop because

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.740
your mind is like really powerfully

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.980
reflecting itself it sees itself in

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.899
everything it sees so the story just

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.940
gets stronger and stronger until blast

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.160
off and now psychotic break was that

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.779
exactly

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:17.040
yeah

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.779
you know like common

00:10:18.779 --> 00:10:21.420
temporary psychosis that people have

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.339
it's their first time meditators

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:25.980
sometimes they end up having to have

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.440
triage at the end of like a 10-day

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.740
meditation because

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.240
there they

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.519
it's quite common for the mind to do

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:38.240
this so it's not like a full-blown

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.440
psychosis but

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.660
um it's it's it's quite common and it's

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.300
one of these uh you know you can read

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.920
all about that some dangers of

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.480
meditation but

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.620
um what would you say is the difference

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.980
between like meditators

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.360
psychosis and full-blown

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.880
psychosis other than just like

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.920
the practice that the person has with

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.220
working with these things and like

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.019
awareness and contextualization

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:07.019
yeah so I would say you know a lot of

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:10.440
times I I you've heard me say that

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.040
um

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.579
we need uh

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:15.480
psychotechnologies for the kinds of

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.360
Minds we have today

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.399
and uh the kinds of Minds we have today

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.480
do tend to have this loopy thing

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.180
um so so there's a lot of Proto protos

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.339
you know like Ian the Gilchrist and and

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:34.680
you know so there's so

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.600
um and that's because so much of our

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.700
experience is uh is virtual this

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.680
experience will happen we talked about

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.019
this last time we have to do a lot of

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:44.940
work to

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.339
um stimulate that this is real and not

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.980
to be skeptical about it uh you know the

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.440
technology makes it easy

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.839
um but but

00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.959
um

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.860
but full-blown psychosis I don't know I

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.180
mean

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.839
um

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.220
the

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.680
the story I like to tell with about my

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.720
friend who has full-blown psychosis he

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.700
had a breakdown here he lives in Germany

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.740
is

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.640
um

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.279
he he had someone bring him here because

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.620
he was having a breakdown and he was

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.260
afraid that he was going to end up in a

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.420
mental institution in the U.S and that

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.339
they were going to give him drugs that

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:27.839
had happened to him before and he wanted

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:29.940
to get home because he has a great uh

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.519
psychiatrist he works with that home

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:36.000
so he came here and uh someone brought

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.040
him here and he just had enough presence

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.980
of mind to say promise me you'll get me

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.740
on that plane no matter what I do or say

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.339
because right because he knew that it

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:49.019
could get really weird and he could

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:52.980
pretend you know and so I was having a

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.660
retreat that weekend and all these

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.120
people were coming over and for the

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.000
first two days I was with him and worked

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.279
with him and then I said you know these

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.300
people are going to come over and I'm

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.800
not going to be able to like pay

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.899
attention to you so if you need anything

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:10.139
like food or water he was staying in a

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:12.779
basement apartment or anything just ask

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:15.839
me and then two days later he was coming

00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:17.639
up and I was coming down we were just

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:21.860
crossing and he stopped he said you know

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:24.839
all I've been thinking about for the

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:27.000
last two days is what did you mean by

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.040
food and what did you mean by water you

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.040
thought it was cold for something and it

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.339
was just like

00:13:34.339 --> 00:13:37.380
yeah swimming in his own mind trying to

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.440
figure out what it was code for by

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.320
swimming in his own mind right

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.440
um so and then I promised him that I'm

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.079
always only talking about food and water

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:53.820
so uh so yeah it's this derealization of

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.740
the

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.959
the language and the thought loses

00:13:57.959 --> 00:14:00.300
contact with the signifiers in the real

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.279
world and if you're talking about

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:04.860
witnessing awareness

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.220
that already is kind of losing contact

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.680
with signifiers in the in the real world

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.720
so

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.200
um there's something something like that

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.279
um

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:19.880
Construction

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:25.579
yeah so

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.320
um these are all uh

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.040
um

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.160
parts of this this module these

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.399
questions

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.220
uh maybe it's a good time to share this

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.680
slide again I think because of what you

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.540
just asked

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.339
um

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:51.839
and

00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:53.839
um

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.940
what you will notice so as people we can

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.420
make it more like cognitive science

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.079
uh

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:04.880
and as people

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.680
somebody get too many things

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.339
hide accordingly videos okay so as

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:12.600
people

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.880
um go on this journey of metacognition

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.660
let's say or you know at first there's

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.720
an automaticity to things you're either

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.660
very objective or you're very subjective

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.839
people start off quite objective

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:32.699
then early on in life uh you learn

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:35.459
um that you know you have start to have

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:38.339
an interior you're aware of your

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:41.220
interiority so you learn to say please

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.360
and you learn you know different

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.579
uh you're not so automatic

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.260
um and then you spend a lot of time with

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.660
the playground is very objective and

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.720
then you might then get to high school

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.699
and you start having philosophical

00:15:56.699 --> 00:15:59.459
questions and then in high school it's

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.320
quite often for you know there's a

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.839
window for psychosis that happens I

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:05.760
think from something like

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.519
18 to 32

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:10.860
um and people spend a lot of time in

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.899
this objective realm

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:15.899
um and watching their subjectivity and

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:17.880
this is when we take drugs and we play

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.820
with the Psychedelic self

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.560
and we

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.500
um this is modern people uh if you're a

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.899
rural person you spend a lot more time

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:29.459
in the objective world because you have

00:16:29.459 --> 00:16:32.760
those kinds of tasks to do right but

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.220
um today's people they and then your

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.279
psyche starts to become transparent if

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:40.620
you meditate and ask these questions you

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.259
spend a lot of time here so there's a

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:46.380
long period of time in the modern world

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.019
today where people spend a lot of time

00:16:49.019 --> 00:16:52.500
you know investigating trauma and all

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.899
these past lives and all this stuff is

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:56.880
all subjective phenomenon that they're

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.940
very interested in then you might peek

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.880
over here and have a kind of uh Peak

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.579
experience in nature

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.780
and then what happens over time in my

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.079
opinion on the path or is that you

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.000
eventually

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.640
um work your way toward

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.939
instead of so much oscillation

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.980
um you work your way towards like this

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.020
could be like you discovering your body

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.480
like we do in this course then you find

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.120
out well a lot of this was simulation

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.120
actually my body lives in the real world

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.600
it has an animal nature

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.500
um I can I can start seeing some of that

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.140
um myself then becomes transparent as

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.840
phenomenon in my mind and then pretty

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.140
soon the oscillation stops

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.780
and you have what verbat you've got

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.760
trans

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.320
objective or what of all these words you

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.480
use and then and when the oscillation

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.780
stops you get this sense that

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.220
um so this is very cruel right it's a

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.679
very crude uh uh

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:10.559
um diagram but

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:12.840
it is this kind of Journey that people

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.480
people have and when the oscillation

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.600
stops life becomes a whole lot simpler

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.539
because it's not like you're just

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:24.900
objective like you were before

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.380
but you can start working with the world

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.320
in a much simpler way

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.960
um so instead of going in my mind to see

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.660
what the feedback loop of an action is I

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.280
just take the action

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.580
as mindfully as I can and I see

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.059
what the consequences so I start to work

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:46.620
with

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.559
what would seem you know this is the end

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:51.240
of the Taoist you know you go back into

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.820
the marketplace and you look like

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.799
someone who's just interested in the

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.900
world again you don't have such a

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.880
complicated psyche you don't have so

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.820
much going on but it's it's not the same

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.799
as when you started out and didn't

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.900
understand that you had emotions and

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.700
didn't understand the complexity of your

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.460
mind it's it's beyond it's beyond that

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.559
so

00:19:13.559 --> 00:19:17.400
um there is there is uh that's that's

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.440
one path

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.480
um of course there's different

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.799
traditions and some of the Traditions

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:24.539
you end up

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.559
um

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:28.620
um in what I would call uh mental

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.140
phenomenon quite heavily

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.320
um so the the uh

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.160
um

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.760
there's there's the class the cultures

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.919
where the Priestly classes didn't have

00:19:40.919 --> 00:19:43.740
to do work or touch the soil they they

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.340
ended up with uh religions where you

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.260
could have all kinds of fantasies about

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.919
that it's all just Lila and these

00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:54.780
suffering's not real the self is not

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.020
real to me that's all that's all mental

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.539
phenomenon but that's you know that's

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:03.360
that's from this perspective

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.140
um so this this movement uh perhaps is

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.539
actually a movement of the human species

00:20:09.539 --> 00:20:12.720
itself we're all kind of you know in

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.559
this virtual

00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:17.660
subjective

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.760
subjective uh or fascinated with this

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.400
subjective aspect

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.220
um of experience right now

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.059
not Elon Musk so much but most most

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:33.120
people that in our in our

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.740
communities

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.220
yeah

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.780
okay are we ready for Breakout

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.039
yeah

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:07.380
yes okay so I'm gonna put this in the

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.400
chat

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.380
um I'm not sure if you can see that it

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.260
it when you're in the breakout room so

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.480
maybe just

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.140
um

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.320
memorize this we're gonna use these two

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.299
different definitions we started with

00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:23.580
them a little bit last time

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.960
and so young Jang chosen gays and this

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.700
little both lines when we said oh it's a

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.840
great little book

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.020
she she uh

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.840
defines mindfulness at the beginning and

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.539
this is a very typical definition of

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:41.159
mindfulness when it's just like

00:21:41.159 --> 00:21:44.039
mindfulness practice you know like at

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:46.140
the center for mindfulness training in

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.240
Massachusetts

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.880
um she says mindfulness is deliberately

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.820
paying full attention

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.059
to what is happening around you and

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:02.880
within you in your body heart and mind

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.980
okay so all these little words are

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.260
important

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.620
and I want to say what

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.039
I'm interested in is modifying that

00:22:14.039 --> 00:22:16.980
we've we've said this in many different

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.900
ways

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.700
um

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.120
with respect to not having the isolation

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.460
so see there's an oscillation pays full

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.020
attention to what's happening around you

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.280
and in you right so and deliberately

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.380
paying full attention these are all

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.720
trigger words for me okay so think about

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.700
that and I want to suggest what we

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.400
should teach for the kinds of body Minds

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.220
we have today and this challenges we

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.600
face today is attending to what is

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.780
happening around you

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.000
with your body heart

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.400
and mind

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.900
so let's just uh have a conversation on

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.880
um

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.220
what what does that what do the two

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.440
modes that just so their instructions

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.320
that create a dispositional state right

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.880
the first one

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.280
creates a state where you're more likely

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.919
to do this and less likely to do that

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:18.600
what are the differences in the

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.980
instructions

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.200
what are the pitfalls and challenges and

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.600
what are the perhaps

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.380
um

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.440
what is missing in the second one

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.260
um if if you if you feel that

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.080
something's missing in the second

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.960
um and are are they stages like just

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.700
talk about

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.659
um

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:43.860
talk about these these two moves and

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.860
um I'm going to create breakout rooms

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.679
we're going to go

00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:52.400
um let's see

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.059
yeah we'll have three or four

00:23:56.059 --> 00:23:59.400
uh I don't want let's see that's fine

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.120
and we're gonna go for

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.900
um 30

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.419
let's see 33 minutes

00:24:09.419 --> 00:24:11.220
which will bring us to the top of the

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.580
hour enjoy your conversation and enjoy

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.240
your company

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:35.000
foreign

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.020
they are I'll put it in the chat

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.220
they're going to

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.100
talk about the different

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.840
definitions of mindfulness here and

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.820
reflexive awareness I think you heard us

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.880
talk about this before yes yes yes so

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.740
we'll see what they have to say

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.620
and by the way I didn't Advance on the

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.539
text these past couple of weeks because

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:17.820
I've been preparing for this but I'm

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.280
going back once this is over and I'm

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.120
back I'm gonna dive into the dad fly

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.600
awesome

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:30.000
I like that like that

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.600
no scrunched up faces this time

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.000
it's a darn well it's a ray comes back

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.799
I actually did the homework too I wrote

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:46.220
some things

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.840
and I asked chat GPT but I didn't like

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.600
the answer was kind of bland so thank

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.980
you

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.860
they're playing with the thing all day

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.040
uh

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.180
[Music]

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.900
yes Anna Maslow Van Der Blanc hello

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.159
bonita Roy

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:13.620
I've got a question this was amazing I

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.539
was in the room with Katie and John and

00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:20.279
a client and that was wonderful and

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:23.100
um I was listening yesterday to the

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.080
recap where and made Elena were there

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.940
and Katie were there and Sam was there

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.179
and yeah and Samuel was there and so

00:26:30.179 --> 00:26:32.220
everyone was there almost but it was it

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.020
was lovely and I was wondering

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.659
hard life yes and I had an inquiry

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:42.600
around the sensory motor perception and

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.460
the virtual perception and the

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.620
distinction between the psyche so you

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.500
and ego and the mind Alo Centric

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.600
because what hit me almost like a

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.120
thunderbolt was the mind is that like

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.360
the entry point and it's like is that

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.940
The Sweet Spot

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:05.179
okay well here's the thing

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.740
I just picked up a couple of things you

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.659
said

00:27:08.659 --> 00:27:11.400
because the question is too big and

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.419
it'll it'll come back around

00:27:15.419 --> 00:27:16.559
um

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:22.159
so this second thing uh

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:26.960
attend to what is around you

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.840
already puts you in an allocentric uh

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.400
frame right whereas pay attention to

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.279
um what is in your you know what is

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:41.460
around you and in your own experience

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.179
um

00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:46.260
has more of an egocentric frame so uh

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.779
attend to what is what is around you is

00:27:48.779 --> 00:27:51.419
already allocentric

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:54.900
and not egocentric

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.659
so that's one thing and what else did

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:00.240
you say so what's The Sweet Spot

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.580
yeah because I was wondering about

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.220
because you made a distinction around me

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.559
because I I'm I'm not sure about it so

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:09.299
that's why I want to ask and it wasn't a

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:11.820
question so here I go into a question so

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.299
is a sensory motor perception what was

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:17.100
the evolutionist virtual perception

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.140
evolution of that or is it the opposite

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.380
way oh okay

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.100
so

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.659
um no sensory motor is is

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.159
sensory motor is prior to Virtual

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:40.320
perception we can see that in the

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.080
evolutionary record the question then

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.600
becomes what is prior to sensory motor

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.600
perception

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.659
um we didn't talk about that you're

00:28:51.659 --> 00:28:54.240
going to get into

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.559
um where physics and biology interface

00:28:58.559 --> 00:29:02.360
um but I wouldn't call that virtual

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.760
I would call that

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.460
um I mean I'm building oath it's theory

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.120
around action protocols but but

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.200
um

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.419
yeah we have sensory motive perception

00:29:15.419 --> 00:29:18.779
and then we virtualize it into and even

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:21.779
animals have virtual perception right at

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:23.460
a certain at a certain

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.919
uh in a certain place in The

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:28.940
evolutionary history

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.320
so virtual perception comes from sensory

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.299
motive perception which is sensory motor

00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:38.880
perception come from I guess that's what

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.380
you're asking

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.700
we have to ask Richmond

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.880
no it comes from I mean

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.539
um when we get there we have to have do

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.840
some speculative philosophy right

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:58.799
um so but there's a lot are we doing

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:01.740
Plumbing there yes when we uh do

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.960
speculative philosophy in order for us

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.679
to both uh hold that in our jamboard we

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:11.179
will be doing uh simulating forming so

00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:14.159
uh which doesn't mean it doesn't get you

00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:17.880
to the right place because we have this

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.380
thing that we can do which is called

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.720
Pure abstractions that we think of these

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.360
things because they happen to be real

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.399
they're they're not there at the same

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:27.840
time

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.120
um if you listen to Sawyer's talk with

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.140
me

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.020
he said that he said

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.760
I don't know if I agreed this but he

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.260
said you know people have always been

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.080
suspicious oh no this is what he said he

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.279
said people use this term God

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:46.200
um because it's the best way they can

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.919
interpret the aggregor of of humans or

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:52.080
something like that but

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.299
yeah so that would bring us if we're

00:30:54.299 --> 00:30:56.299
trying to ask the question

00:30:56.299 --> 00:31:01.140
what is the book prior to sensory mode

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.000
of perception

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.640
we'll try to we'll try to answer some of

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.100
this in the fall like the origins of the

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.520
human itself or the origins of life but

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.600
this is now speculative we can't

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.120
I can see that an animal

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.880
has abstractions and I can see that pure

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.120
abstractions work in the world I can't

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.539
I I we have to run simulations to

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:30.299
inquire about these speculative things

00:31:30.299 --> 00:31:32.399
but

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:33.299
um

00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:36.200
the hook we have is that that

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.179
some of the ideas we're working with

00:31:39.179 --> 00:31:40.919
could be

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:45.720
real features of the world uh if because

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.419
we know that pure abstractions exist in

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:50.279
the world they're not there at the same

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:51.659
time blah blah blah all the stuff we

00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:54.059
said in the last module that I I know

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:55.919
sounds like woo-woo speech if we haven't

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:58.080
been there but

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.720
um but I would not say that virtual

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.820
perceptions as we've described them

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.840
comes before such reloaded perceptions

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.860
they wouldn't be sensory motor

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.520
um

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.039
this is where Greg Enriquez will talk

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:16.740
about what we call Century Motors animal

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.659
mind and then he says there's there's

00:32:20.659 --> 00:32:24.059
then he goes down to information so you

00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:26.159
can already feel that

00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:28.860
it's a concept what is information right

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.440
information Theory so what we're going

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.039
to do there is an interesting question

00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:35.840
um

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.360
that hopefully will get to in the fall

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.799
so that's an interesting question

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.539
what is before sensory motive sensory

00:32:45.539 --> 00:32:47.340
motor we would say it goes all the way

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.640
down through all of life

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.659
um

00:32:51.659 --> 00:32:54.240
and then there's things that beg the

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.700
question like viruses these things that

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.820
are like you can't tell you know the

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.120
category living or non-living gets very

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.340
it's very weird there

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.179
um but

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:13.019
maybe by the time in September uh you

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:17.519
will have solved it just a lot of work

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:20.220
what were you gonna say Sandra it's all

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:23.640
Pond life it's all pawns like well I'm

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.860
going to argue it's all kind of like

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.960
Bond life but at a certain point it

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.019
becomes more metaphorical than real

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:33.360
um and I'm writing I'm trying to write

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.919
an article on plant life but

00:33:37.919 --> 00:33:40.519
yeah

00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:42.679
um

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.580
there's so much more I want to ask but

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.220
I'm gonna wait watch and wonder and who

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.140
were you with just Katie because John

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.320
was kind of yeah sorry about that I

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.019
should have put no that was perfect and

00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:00.059
we had a computer joining us and we had

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:01.980
John's client joining us so it's all

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.720
good

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.700
all right cool cool thanks thanks bunny

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:38.700
hmm

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.159
I really liked um

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:45.300
the way that our group was um focusing

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.159
we were noticing just differences in how

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.440
we we felt

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.960
um with like the word the words like

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.359
deliberately and paying which kind of

00:34:54.359 --> 00:34:57.020
imply like a

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.820
transactional relationship and

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.940
um we noticed how the the mindfulness

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.619
instructions kind of set up a

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.420
separateness or like a duality

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.920
ironically and then the um

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:15.000
the reflexive instructions

00:35:15.119 --> 00:35:17.780
set up more of a

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.359
relational participatory

00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:23.400
um frame

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.020
and

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.700
um one other thing I'll throw in we had

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.920
a lot of interesting conversations about

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.720
um or I was thinking I thought it was

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.920
interesting about like the word

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.579
attention and like this hence

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:37.800
which has to do with like

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.859
in different languages like hanging or

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:43.680
Tendencies or

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.560
um tenderness or

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.880
um

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.180
waiting in a town just all kinds of

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.260
things about

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.380
um like literal physical positioning in

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.520
a web

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.740
um we talked about like the game cat's

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.740
cradle and like moving strings around

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.560
um and then um we also brought up like

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.359
when you're underwater and you can kind

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:08.820
of feel the physical position of things

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.260
even if you don't have any other sense

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.540
because the water moves

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.540
um so I'll just throw that into the soup

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.960
one question I had though um in the

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.500
mindfulness instructions it had um

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.359
both like what's happening around you

00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:26.099
and within you

00:37:26.099 --> 00:37:30.000
and in the um reflexive awareness it was

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.920
just about what's happening around

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.060
and I was curious why not within you

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.980
also

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.579
okay so that's a big Crux of the matter

00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:43.700
um

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.480
so

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.660
um

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.740
so I think it's easier to

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.760
um

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.579
advocate for the reflexive awareness if

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:14.940
you start with a person who's not

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.660
already kind of uh

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.000
modernized so let's pretend and then

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.520
we'll answer the question in reality so

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.960
for example

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.240
it's I use I know I use the same

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.920
examples over and over because it's easy

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.780
to remember

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.160
um you have little little Johnny

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.680
you see something it gets all excited he

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.859
jumps up and down and he hits your vase

00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:44.460
right and he breaks your precious face

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.760
and you have two choices you can

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.660
point at him and say why did you do that

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.780
and that has him attend to his interior

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:58.440
space okay and when Johnny's really

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.780
young he doesn't even know what that

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.359
word means

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:06.000
um and you see kids like they just their

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.440
eyes go like this they don't know what

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.880
the word means but you do it enough

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.940
times and this builds the ego at the

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.760
Fred would call the superego inside your

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.220
psyche this is how it gets constructed

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:22.020
so then once you have a superego you can

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.020
construct all kinds of things there

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.720
but what if instead when that happened I

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.160
go oh what happens

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.240
let's look

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.160
well now we're going to attend to cause

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.740
and effect and what happens

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.020
and

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.180
um

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.160
so

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.220
um

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.619
if you're

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:56.520
not polluted okay so this is not real

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.280
because everybody's kind of polluted in

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.660
a way

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.700
um

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:06.960
then attending to the real world

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.579
where'd they go

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:11.400
are they still here

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.859
oh

00:40:13.859 --> 00:40:16.079
I'll come back to it if they come back

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:18.660
attending to the real world

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.859
is the perfect equation because

00:40:21.859 --> 00:40:25.079
the real world is a perfect reflection

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:29.480
of your interior state

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:33.079
get it

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.300
and if you're polluted in your interior

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.579
State then your interactions with the

00:40:38.579 --> 00:40:40.440
world will be polluted

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.140
so if you could you can fix it on that

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.640
side of the equation

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.560
that's my point

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.300
this is like the grade I have

00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:52.619
now the problem with the second

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:54.599
definition

00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:57.300
is people have to care

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.940
you have to give a about the world

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:03.320
or else there's no Leverage

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.540
attend to what I can't even notice what

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.099
is needed here

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:12.619
parents can't even notice what's needed

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.420
then that's what's lost

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:36.420
so we go to intentional attention

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.339
practice

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:40.500
to control the attention

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:42.720
intentionally

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.619
somewhat recursive what's controlling it

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:48.300
it's all mental

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.560
whereas if you care for things

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.440
your attention will be controlled and

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.960
focused so it's heart based

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.940
when you care for something you pay

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.780
attention

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.300
it's not rocket science

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:20.720
and people just don't care

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:29.339
or don't know how to care

00:42:29.339 --> 00:42:31.619
they're so separated from even their own

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:32.760
kids

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.060
and their work their Works jobs

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.700
it's hard to care people don't care

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.859
remember we did the communal self

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:43.619
there's four dimensions of care and

00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:47.160
there is no non-recipical care a mutual

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.640
uh uh deep mutuality anymore we don't

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.000
care

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.099
so that's the hook in the second one and

00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:58.260
it's it's it's it's the hook in its

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.160
Achilles heel

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.380
yeah nothing you know

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.599
um I always put a g in your name and

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:12.839
your name doesn't have a jig nope no G

00:43:12.839 --> 00:43:17.160
not it's Natalie yeah I always say

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.830
Magdalena it's your Catholic I know

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.200
[Music]

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.400
um

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.760
you can just call me mad I've earned it

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.619
um

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:29.700
okay Maddie

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.420
all right so if one of the affects

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.720
streams I mean

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.780
subcognitive is is is care yeah you know

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:44.880
it's distinct from last place each you

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:48.800
know fear rage grief Etc yes

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.800
then we're hardwired to care as mammals

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.900
yes

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.300
and so it's not that we don't care

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.020
I think that we're always caring but I

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.000
think that there is kind of a

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.119
procrustian bed of logic that keeps

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:08.720
chopping off the possibility of caring

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.819
or worse than that commodifying it

00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:15.060
because it's because it's hardwired it's

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.700
very easy to financialize

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.800
right it's those four domains of care

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.859
but remember what the care is there's

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:27.240
care and then there's the there's it's

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.240
in the connection stream and we don't

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.859
care because we don't feel connected

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.079
the mind is not connected to the body

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:39.960
the body's not connected to Nature

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:45.180
so this these things go

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:48.119
go hand in hand

00:44:48.119 --> 00:44:50.460
okay salt

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.940
I had the big mic drop and you guys

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.540
weren't here

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.819
I know we lost internet connection and

00:44:59.819 --> 00:45:01.500
jolt's in the bathroom right now

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.540
oh

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.579
just a second

00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:08.760
we're excited about it though

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.839
so so I would argue

00:45:12.839 --> 00:45:14.940
I would argue that whether it's because

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.400
it's been commodified out of us or this

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.640
or that what the source is yes it's

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.400
we're hardwired it's latent in US it

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.720
can't possibly not be latent in us but

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.700
um

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:34.140
yeah the point is is that okay so did

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:35.940
you hear my story about the kid in the

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.180
vase

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.839
we just like lost connection right there

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:45.540
so the kid broke the vase and then the

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.040
mom's like why did you do that and he's

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.599
like oh my God like I don't even know

00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:51.260
what myself

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.800
this this is puts a super ego on the kid

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.839
this is beginning of the construction of

00:45:57.839 --> 00:46:01.079
a uh super Evo and then once you have a

00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:03.060
super ego you can tie all kinds of stuff

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.839
on it but what if you said instead oh

00:46:06.839 --> 00:46:09.960
wow what happened

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.260
right let's attend to the world what

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.319
happened positive facts have a

00:46:16.319 --> 00:46:19.079
conversation around it pick it up oh you

00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:21.240
know or when they get hurt you know

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.540
let's let's attend to it pick it up it's

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.000
always a responses to attend to

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.680
something

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.720
um then this bill Builds an allocentric

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.720
and then I said

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.880
allocentric yeah so Allison this means

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.680
you're involved in the world you don't

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.780
reference experience relative to

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.079
yourself which is egocentric you

00:46:43.079 --> 00:46:45.300
reference the world with

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.079
with you know relative to the world

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:52.920
ontological design the thing is broken

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.740
um so it's just it's it references the

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.160
state of things in relationship to other

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.579
the state of things their egocentric

00:47:02.579 --> 00:47:04.859
means you're positive and negatively

00:47:04.859 --> 00:47:06.900
balancing experience with reference to

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.000
yourself

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:09.660
um

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.839
so here's the thing and then I said well

00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:15.660
my reflexive awareness

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.839
the problem with this is we don't know

00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:21.780
how to attend two things

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.079
we don't notice what things need parents

00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:28.740
don't even notice what their kids need

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:32.420
and so the

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:37.940
mindfulness can help you

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.540
Focus your attention right but the

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.180
reason why we need intentional design to

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.220
discipline our attention

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.980
whereas in reflexive awareness your

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.859
attention is focused focused because you

00:47:52.859 --> 00:47:54.060
care

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.000
if you care about things you get really

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.380
focused

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:02.520
and basically we just don't care

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.160
we don't care about anything

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.859
you think about a lot of things but we

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:10.500
don't care about things and hence we

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.020
don't attend to things hence our

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.819
attention

00:48:14.819 --> 00:48:16.200
is

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.960
not there so then we have to go to these

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.300
psycho Technologies to concentrate our

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.760
attention through mental discipline but

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.800
if we cared about things

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.140
you would have

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.839
skillful attention

00:48:30.839 --> 00:48:32.640
and that's the big difference between

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.180
the two

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.900
now what about

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.460
um

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.440
the kid just caring about the kid

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.160
learning what his emotions are and how

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.920
to soothe them Etc like

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.140
Okay so

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.960
so we talked about this I'll say it

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.780
again I just feel bad that I'm like oh

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.619
sorry I only have five things

00:48:57.619 --> 00:49:00.180
just like fast forward and we'll no no

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:01.680
no

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.780
[Applause]

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:06.420
so it's good that kids learn language to

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.480
identify their emotions

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.420
but of course we know that that words

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.940
there's many many many many more

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:17.280
dispositional States than the words for

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.040
them and the problem with the way we

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.680
raise our kids is we ask them to use

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:25.020
their words really fast you know like

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.880
the kids getting all and they use your

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.980
words well the kid

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.920
learns against Crime so he uses this

00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.980
word I'm sad or something but many times

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.660
they're not sad when they're crying I

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.220
cry all the time when I'm not sad I'm

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.599
just overwhelmed

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:45.119
and so I meet young men usually who in

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:47.280
their uh late

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.480
20s or early 20s realize that they've

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.819
been using words but they never realize

00:49:53.819 --> 00:49:57.079
that words are supposed to point to

00:49:57.079 --> 00:49:59.700
biomarkers what their body feels like

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.400
because we have a language Instinct so

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.040
kids learn the language that is relevant

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.720
to certain socially appropriate

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.660
situations and never learn that they're

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.140
supposed to refer to us or signify

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.720
something that's happening in their body

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:20.280
and what happens in their body is is

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.920
there's you know the one word sad and

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.339
sad there's it doesn't it doesn't

00:50:26.339 --> 00:50:29.280
represent the range of things we use

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.040
that word for so basically we're just

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.740
all artistic that way we are autistic

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.140
people can learn how to use words that

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:39.780
have emotional reference because they

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.619
learn what socially uh relevant but they

00:50:43.619 --> 00:50:46.619
do not have the connection between the

00:50:46.619 --> 00:50:48.900
word and the lived experience

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.700
so

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.220
so we're too fast to go into the mental

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.800
the mental the mental the mental and you

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.140
know I talked about lots of things care

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:00.359
abstractions and mental and simulating

00:51:00.359 --> 00:51:03.180
all this stuff is really cool but that

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.420
mental is not we don't we we don't

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.839
integrate the body and then we're pretty

00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:11.940
good at liberating the mind and some of

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.619
these psycho Technologies but they don't

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:16.559
integrate the body so

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:19.680
um we need to to

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.839
seriously consider

00:51:21.839 --> 00:51:23.819
uh

00:51:23.819 --> 00:51:27.859
some of these these alternatives

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.440
I don't know if I'm gonna say this right

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.160
but you did assassinate around

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.579
trauma and inviting people

00:51:38.579 --> 00:51:41.280
to speak of the story of the drama

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.700
without using words but it just sounds

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.760
coming from the throat and I thought

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.660
that was extremely effective that on one

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:55.079
hand that comes out but you don't have

00:51:55.079 --> 00:51:56.579
to put names

00:51:56.579 --> 00:52:00.119
and and relive it in that way that it's

00:52:00.119 --> 00:52:01.559
a narrative

00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:03.599
and that's how you do this they'll get

00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:05.400
all upset and then they'll go into their

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.680
yeah

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.480
you know and then if you just with that

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:14.720
and you can you learn their language

00:52:14.819 --> 00:52:17.640
you're the adult you learn their

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.319
language well how do you know their

00:52:19.319 --> 00:52:21.240
language you can't learn it if you don't

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.960
have some effective resonance with them

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.420
and that's in a pro-age appropriate

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.380
stage

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.940
they're in their bodies

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.200
but you had us do it with you know as

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.720
adults and I think

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.839
this whole thing with with the trauma

00:52:42.839 --> 00:52:45.180
industry and whatever

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:50.280
um you know it presumes too much of the

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:54.680
coarse grain language and and keeps

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.720
re-narrativizing the story and it

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.720
doesn't necessarily offer I think a

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.460
space of affect ability which is what I

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.440
post I posted a video in the notes

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:10.559
section today Lisa Feldman Barrett she

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.660
says what I've been saying the body

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:16.260
doesn't keep the score the trauma she

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.240
says the Mind keeps the score and the

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.380
body's its scorecard

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.579
because it's a narrative that recreates

00:53:29.579 --> 00:53:32.099
the problem and complicates the problem

00:53:32.099 --> 00:53:33.540
and

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.160
can I can I tell a little story please

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:41.099
so um I'm a mother

00:53:41.099 --> 00:53:42.420
and

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:45.240
um I'm also a Dance Movement therapist

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.180
I'm very interested in creative process

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.680
and dance in terms of

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.160
um I guess psychological technology

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.960
new word for me

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:00.420
um that's what I do

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.760
when my daughter was this is a story

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.700
that I love because it illustrates the

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:07.980
point that you're describing about the

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.099
phenomena Bonnie that that it's it's a

00:54:11.099 --> 00:54:15.780
great success that parents of my like my

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.119
parents generation when they were

00:54:18.119 --> 00:54:19.920
children they did they weren't given the

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.740
words for language then therapists were

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.020
given whole maps to be able to be like

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.000
here here are all the possible emotions

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.720
right that you can name great when I was

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.180
a parent and I at my daughter I took my

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.260
daughter to

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.500
um and my son to go on a

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.160
um a fire truck

00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:44.040
and my son was like yeah he's you know

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.960
three years older than she is so he got

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.300
up on the fire truck he's like in the

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.020
seat driving and the firemen

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.440
picked up my daughter who was only about

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.140
14 months picked her up to put her into

00:54:58.140 --> 00:54:59.880
the truck

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.460
and she looked at me and she said

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:05.099
hot

00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:07.640
hot

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.800
and because I have my own relationship

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.339
with anxiety and heat as a phenomena

00:55:14.339 --> 00:55:17.460
that arises I took her out of his hands

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.859
and I said oh did that make you feel hot

00:55:19.859 --> 00:55:23.880
and I reinforced the phenomena and her

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.319
ability to describe them as it as it

00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:31.859
arose in the moment because

00:55:31.859 --> 00:55:34.980
that then could build toward her saying

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.440
wow when that dude I didn't know picked

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.000
me up it made me feel really anxious but

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.920
that's developmentally not where we were

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.660
right so

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:46.160
um I think this conversation of of

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:48.059
development

00:55:48.059 --> 00:55:51.180
um and the stages this came out a lot in

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.180
our conversation and it was really

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.640
fascinating and Rich like not everything

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.980
can be taught at the exact same time

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.900
that wasn't a moment for me to be like

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.660
what you're actually experiencing is

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:06.839
it was validating being able to track

00:56:06.839 --> 00:56:08.819
and report on the phenomena that were

00:56:08.819 --> 00:56:11.040
arising in her body that was my job as a

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.160
parent

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.500
yeah and so you can imagine

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.200
the parent who gets really mad at the

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:23.460
firefighter

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.220
and the whole thing escalates into like

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:29.700
like so you needed space

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:34.140
you needed awareness the child

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.839
experiences you as having the space and

00:56:36.839 --> 00:56:40.380
the time to yeah all of that is very

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.720
very important

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.839
um

00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:49.920
yeah and and also going back to this

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.140
idea of care like the attention itself

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:59.099
is the communication of care

00:56:59.099 --> 00:57:01.859
so what I was attending to was her

00:57:01.859 --> 00:57:04.140
description of the phenomena that we're

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:07.140
arising the heat right because that

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.640
mattered in that moment so this is

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.559
this is a huge one zakstan talks about

00:57:13.559 --> 00:57:16.500
about it a lot that a lot

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:19.200
most of what

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.540
childhood education is is joint

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.420
attention they're teaching children to

00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:26.880
have attention because you're jointly

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.680
attending to them

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.099
versus giving them a book and seeing if

00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:33.599
they can pay attention to what they're

00:57:33.599 --> 00:57:36.180
reading and this is what he says is

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.119
lacking in the teacherly

00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:41.640
that the teachers

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.619
um skill set and it's modern education

00:57:43.619 --> 00:57:46.500
but the way to teach attention and

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.160
attending is by

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.099
creating joint attention

00:57:53.099 --> 00:57:55.020
um and that's what you were doing right

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.859
so you and her were jointly attending to

00:57:58.859 --> 00:58:01.319
her body

00:58:01.319 --> 00:58:03.420
um this is the same thing

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:05.160
um if you you know I don't have kids so

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.960
I love the fact that some of the things

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:09.900
I say have actually true in the real

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.099
world

00:58:11.099 --> 00:58:14.280
um but I've rescued a lot of like abused

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.040
dogs let's say like and

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.040
um when they understand that you

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.900
understand what's happening in their

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:26.220
body then they pay attention to you

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:26.880
um

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:28.920
so it's neutral not whether it's right

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.520
or wrong it's just I know how you feel

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.559
um and

00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:37.980
um uh as soon as they realize that you

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.839
have an insight into their internal

00:58:39.839 --> 00:58:42.780
State then they very very much bond with

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:44.280
you

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.140
um

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:50.940
nobody gets it right all the time but

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:54.359
um this is one of the foundations of

00:58:54.359 --> 00:58:56.819
pro-social mammalian life

00:58:56.819 --> 00:59:00.480
uh is even you see these wonderful

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.000
videos of animals and their babies that

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.280
them the baby knows the mother knows

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.839
it's internal

00:59:06.839 --> 00:59:09.420
state

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.859
and

00:59:10.859 --> 00:59:12.240
um you know and this is if you're going

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.700
to use the term trauma which I agree is

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:19.680
is also uh one of the reasons why people

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.819
who

00:59:20.819 --> 00:59:23.760
may not have been abused as children

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.260
still have some

00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:30.299
uh psychological trauma because they've

00:59:30.299 --> 00:59:32.220
not had this experience of joint

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.700
intention

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:49.260
um I was fortunate enough to be in

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:55.579
Kimberly's group with uh Marie and Susan

00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.500
oh God

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.500
and

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:10.160
it was very Dynamic and very

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.059
enlivening and happy making

01:00:15.059 --> 01:00:17.900
and

01:00:19.859 --> 01:00:23.760
I'm speaking to

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.280
add to this discussion

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:32.520
what I tried to see what was missing

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.799
between the two

01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.839
definitions

01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:40.020
and it may be

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:44.780
the filter that I'm looking at

01:00:45.299 --> 01:00:47.700
um reflective awareness definition

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.220
through and

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.040
it's been what I've been scratching away

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.099
at for three years in the pop-up school

01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:57.599
I think

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:00.900
and that's what you called intimate

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.280
coupling

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.119
of heart

01:01:05.819 --> 01:01:06.660
um

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.480
body and mind and in that second

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.579
definition

01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:17.819
I didn't really get that coupling as the

01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:21.480
um entry point into the flow

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.559
of reality

01:01:27.299 --> 01:01:29.880
so maybe if there was another and in

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.220
there or something I don't know how to

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.200
but

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.440
so I just want to point that out and it

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.339
maybe it's me because I have lived a

01:01:41.339 --> 01:01:42.540
long life

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:46.440
with my mind over here and my body down

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.380
here and my heart somewhere in the

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.720
middle of all that maybe entangled and

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.680
all that

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.440
so I just wanna

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.339
um note that as a uh uh

01:01:59.339 --> 01:02:02.480
a thank you

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.319
for this the infusion

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.859
uh into my

01:02:10.859 --> 01:02:14.760
room allowing me to clean up my room as

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:18.559
you said Peterson said

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.200
for my soul's sake so thank you for that

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.619
um having said that

01:02:28.619 --> 01:02:35.160
I took Anna's question to be about that

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.260
the virtual being the mind

01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:45.540
and what I came to in our group was

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.940
without the mind how are we creating

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:55.760
how do we create without the mind

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.339
isn't the mind giving us some Clues

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.720
that we create with

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:06.839
like when we're dancing we talk Kimberly

01:03:06.839 --> 01:03:10.079
was dancing talking about dancing

01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:12.480
feeling into the body and moving and I'm

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.400
you know I do that sometimes when I

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.500
dance but sometimes I also

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.640
you know

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.220
I remember that I do the if I do the

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.319
twirl alone I'm gonna get dizzy and hurt

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:25.500
myself so I twirl a lot and then I don't

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.920
so the Mind helps me create

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.559
and then the last thing I pointed out

01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:35.640
was that and it's about and it's in my

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.819
heart this notion of care and so thank

01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:41.700
you for bringing that in the the story

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.980
about the the hungry person and you're

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:46.559
walking by the hungry person

01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:48.720
and you you can't relate to him because

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.579
you're privileged but you reach your

01:03:50.579 --> 01:03:52.140
hand out or you stick your hand in your

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.420
pocket and give him a piece of candy

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:57.540
that you know that doesn't that come

01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.359
from including the mind and values and

01:04:00.359 --> 01:04:02.940
morals and all those things

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.380
so um that's just a flavor of more about

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.319
what I came to in our group but it was

01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:13.880
really a special Breakout

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.020
so

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.280
um

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.200
I was struck by

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.680
what you said Bonnie with

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.140
um how

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:18.359
the attending to what is happening

01:06:18.359 --> 01:06:23.700
around you that you have to care

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.680
and

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.000
um I've been reading about burnout

01:06:30.299 --> 01:06:31.559
um

01:06:31.559 --> 01:06:35.520
lately and what happens for people when

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.380
they get burnt out in in their jobs and

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.220
one of the

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:48.070
one of the dimensions of burnout is

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:48.480
[Music]

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.319
um

01:06:49.319 --> 01:06:51.960
is is cynicism

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.640
and negativism and feeling like just

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.140
this distancing with

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:04.079
what it is that

01:07:04.079 --> 01:07:06.599
um we're doing and it just it just

01:07:06.599 --> 01:07:08.220
really struck me

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.220
um

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:15.539
and it um

01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:18.059
yeah the ways in which our lives are

01:07:18.059 --> 01:07:19.980
organized so that it becomes really hard

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.460
to care

01:07:25.079 --> 01:07:30.140
yeah so this is you know

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.359
it's all kind of circuitous

01:07:36.359 --> 01:07:39.059
you have to attend to your life so that

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:41.880
you have the space and time to be able

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:45.359
to attend to things you know I mean

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:48.180
um I'm a you know me I'm a big believer

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:51.180
in I've advocated

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:55.260
in the like the coaches Rising thing is

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.180
you need space

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.500
you need bandwidth

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.940
if you don't have any bandwidth you

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.119
can't

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.500
especially if you have you want to

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.319
transform the way this thing works

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:12.480
because you realize it's just on

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:13.980
automatic

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.980
you need bandwidth

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:19.920
um and this is one reason why you know

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.420
doing

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.540
weekly Retreats or month-long Retreats

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.239
or meditating for two hours a day it

01:08:27.239 --> 01:08:29.880
gets you comfortable with your

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.100
relationship to time oh I have four

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:35.219
hours a day to meditate

01:08:35.219 --> 01:08:36.900
um and and hopefully it gives you

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:40.160
bandwidth and so

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.219
yeah I you know it's not really

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:50.640
that's the Practical that's the

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.040
Practical piece

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.520
um the the amount of time we spend here

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.259
hopefully you know I think a lot of it's

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:01.759
really hard work but

01:09:03.299 --> 01:09:05.580
it does take us out of the world you

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.799
know and

01:09:07.799 --> 01:09:09.920
um

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.580
yeah I just call it bandwidth you know I

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.160
think you know what that means and me

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.540
to uh

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.940
yeah you can't be exhausted all the time

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:26.040
and then expect when something happens

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.660
to respond in this open kind of

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:31.560
reflexive

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.279
way

01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:36.960
not because

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.600
it costs you more energy to be like that

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.000
but it costs you more energy to have to

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.100
change from the way you are to being

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:46.080
like that at first

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:48.660
then you see people who are like

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.880
liberated or whatever

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.179
they they do 10 million more things than

01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:55.800
the average person does and they always

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.219
seem to be fresh right so they have a

01:09:59.219 --> 01:10:01.500
lot of bandwidth but

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.160
having to pay attention and changing

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.040
your life requires it's kind of like

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.739
when you're trying to

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:13.080
rearrange the furniture in a crowded

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.160
room

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.500
right first you have to like put some of

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.940
the furniture out because you just don't

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:22.260
have enough space to rearrange the thing

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.480
and it's very similar to that so like

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.500
one of the great gifts

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.800
is to have

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.860
the right kind of time

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.260
the bandwidth

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:40.159
to change

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.640
and everything in our LA and our reality

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.960
is stacked up to uh not not allow you

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.920
access to that

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:59.940
I'm curious um with this hard work

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.940
like transitioning out of being very

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.260
very subjective

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.239
and trying to come back to more

01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:08.520
objective

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.679
um one like what is the hardness like in

01:11:13.679 --> 01:11:15.659
that process and two like what

01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:17.159
or like practically speaking what does

01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:20.100
that look like if you were too gently

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.320
intentionally move

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.679
yeah it's a great question

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:27.659
um so what

01:11:27.659 --> 01:11:30.360
like is

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.719
um is you have to you have to have a

01:11:33.719 --> 01:11:36.620
certain uh

01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:40.500
experimental attitude let's say

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.199
um and

01:11:42.199 --> 01:11:46.980
you have to but so for me it was like

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.159
starting to realize that

01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:50.300
um

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.219
[Music]

01:11:52.219 --> 01:11:55.380
that I was doing a lot of work before I

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.580
decided

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.280
planning and having the narrative and

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:03.060
this and that and then realizing that

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.440
it was quite irrelevant upon reflection

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.179
retrospectively I would make

01:12:09.179 --> 01:12:11.699
um and

01:12:11.699 --> 01:12:13.500
um so

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.920
a lot of it is just like

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.600
um

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.179
running an experiment like you notice

01:12:21.179 --> 01:12:23.280
that you always say yes

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.640
in a certain situation and then

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.679
you say well what if I just say no

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:33.480
you don't want to say no

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.400
you don't know what's going to happen to

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.400
say no you realize

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.159
I mean some part of you wants to say no

01:12:41.159 --> 01:12:42.900
but you always say yes because this is

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.600
whole context and narrative and

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.820
and then so you just said well what if I

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:49.620
say no and then you say no and the other

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.960
person says oh God I'm so glad you said

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.360
no like that's just like it was costing

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.380
them energy too

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:02.100
so uh you have to it starts with just

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:05.040
having an experimental attitude about

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.880
what Behavior you take on

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.600
and not and and and understand realizing

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.840
that you don't know anything about

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.460
what's going to happen except you're

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.820
running an empirical test

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.940
then pretty soon if you're lucky I guess

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.060
maybe you have to be lucky or

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:31.020
um you realize that a lot of the

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.300
subjective aspect of your decision

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.640
making actually was not helpful it just

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.780
made you more confused

01:13:39.239 --> 01:13:41.040
um and then you start being interested

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.600
in working

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:47.600
in a more objective sort of way

01:13:49.739 --> 01:13:52.560
um so it starts with an experimental

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.100
attitude

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.840
um and then once you get some success

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.900
you think Hmm

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.000
this is there's something to this you

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.580
don't know why and then you can take you

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.980
can take bigger risks

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:09.780
um so

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.640
um and sometimes

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.060
uh you'll the experiment will tell you

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.179
well that was not a smart thing to do

01:14:17.179 --> 01:14:19.980
but if it's a small enough rescue you

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.920
still learn as as you go so I don't know

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.140
somebody might have I can't think of an

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:26.520
example right now but somebody might

01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.380
have an example where

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.120
uh

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:33.860
or something like that for them

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:54.540
foreign people I know you had I knew you

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:58.100
had a story I knew it was you

01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.900
I had another story I was going to tell

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.540
about yesterday but I I think I'll just

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.520
leave that one now

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.179
um

01:15:06.179 --> 01:15:08.640
it's it's quite cool though I was

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.199
interested in what people had to say

01:15:10.199 --> 01:15:14.580
about that but um so my

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:19.500
my remembrance of all of that is that I

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.300
used to do busy

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.699
so I'd be busy busy busy busy busy doing

01:15:23.699 --> 01:15:26.040
this doing that and end up with like a

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.659
list

01:15:27.659 --> 01:15:30.420
and then someone would ask me something

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.000
and I would know I couldn't do it but I

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.440
put it on the list

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:37.560
and then in the end what would happen

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.739
for me how it always unfolded for me is

01:15:40.739 --> 01:15:43.440
that I would get sick

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.380
it wasn't earth-shatteringly requiring

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:48.060
anything major it would be just like a

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.540
cold or a flu and I would have to rest

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.500
and for me

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.540
I didn't really do it I don't know that

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.060
I did an experiment I just got sick of

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.100
this because I haven't had enough of

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:01.500
this and then I realized this lovely

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.840
word bandwidth I love that

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.320
but it was just

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.199
shifting it was a shift

01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:12.900
and to at first it was like having

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:16.500
enough space that spaciousness then it's

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.640
a shift

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.739
to

01:16:19.739 --> 01:16:21.800
being open

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:23.760
listening listening was really

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:27.719
significant word as in being reciprocal

01:16:27.719 --> 01:16:30.120
and this enabled

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.000
really decisions that were I am quite

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.520
practical really but decisions that

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.739
needed to be made

01:16:37.739 --> 01:16:39.480
are quite quick

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:43.340
I just don't and there wasn't as much

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:45.020
involvement

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:48.840
exhaustion all me me me in the whole

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.159
thing

01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:52.020
actually that relates to my little story

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:53.640
I was going to tell should I tell you my

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.400
little story of yesterday Okay so

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.460
yesterday I go I take the kids some kids

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:02.520
that I love or um it's our holidays so

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:04.080
we go rock climbing well I don't know

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.600
rock climbing they go rock climbing okay

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.940
so I get there and the little guy

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.739
William is five

01:17:10.739 --> 01:17:14.100
and William comes up to me and he's sort

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.420
of hanging around and I know he's

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.699
wanting to tell me something but then he

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:19.560
cuddles up and he says

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.840
I'm scared

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:24.000
now once upon a time

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.219
I would have done a big talking talking

01:17:26.219 --> 01:17:28.500
to him blah blah blah blah blah about

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:31.980
all of this and I didn't do anything of

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.060
the sort

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:35.640
because he isn't actually scared

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.679
at all he sounds skeeted and I know he's

01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:40.380
not scared so I give him a big hug and

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.239
then like we we look while I'm hanging

01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:45.300
him I I point out the climbing frame and

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.280
I say we're here to climb these today

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.080
and that's what you're doing

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.760
and they also into that and he climbed

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.420
them

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.460
and this is a really

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.800
so I don't have to use much energy

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.800
really I don't have to do all the

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.020
psychological talking about how he's

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.560
feeling and what's going on because I

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.300
don't even think he was scared

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.520
just he just wanted someone

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.199
this is what we're doing and it's

01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:12.840
nothing much it's fun but it's easy

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.940
we're just doing it that's what we're

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.520
doing it was my message I don't know if

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.320
that makes any sense but that's what

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.500
happened

01:18:21.719 --> 01:18:23.760
it makes a lot of sense and you know

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.360
some people will have experienced that

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.340
story as an impoverished life

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.480
because they're addicted to the drama

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.000
and they're addicted to the

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.699
to that stuff but you should see this

01:18:41.699 --> 01:18:44.820
kid when he climbs up he's so excited

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.460
and he came down the highest one he got

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.860
to he comes down he says to me I'm

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.380
Really Brave Sue I'm so brave and I'm

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.480
like yes we have another hug and then

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.520
he's off come to another one it's just

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.699
like

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.040
I'm simple

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.800
is not easy

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.040
it's my horse Guru told me

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.480
simple is not easy

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:23.940
for the impoverished life is when you

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:26.699
don't have people see that because of

01:19:26.699 --> 01:19:29.159
the drama and the complaining and the da

01:19:29.159 --> 01:19:30.360
da da da

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.280
is that what you're saying yeah

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.600
interesting well and I think part of it

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.860
is because

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:40.940
if if

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.780
well I don't know it's just

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:49.040
I know that

01:19:51.659 --> 01:19:54.960
when some people think about what it

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.000
would be like to live a simple life as

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.520
you're describing they just think it

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.460
would be meaningless or something when

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.620
it actually

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.260
so the beauty and meaning of life

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:11.040
actually has room to to show up

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.960
but

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.280
um there is a

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.360
immunity people have to

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.860
um

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.400
when they imagine themselves in this

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.880
what so called Simple Life

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.440
they can have like an immunity to to it

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.940
because their identity is all about

01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.800
running here and running there and doing

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.600
this and being involved and fixing this

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.159
kid and fixing that kid and then getting

01:20:41.159 --> 01:20:44.040
mad at the mother because you trying to

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:48.140
fix the kid you know all this stuff so

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.580
okay I have another question

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.260
um

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.980
kind of inspired by David sharing of the

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:45.420
role of the mind if I observe

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.420
how you Bonita

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.460
um

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:53.760
uh translate into

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.620
whatever you want to call it words

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:57.980
Theory

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.380
experiences when you're in that exercise

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:05.280
in that experimentation

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.600
um

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.659
what is your mind

01:22:09.659 --> 01:22:13.140
how does your mind work

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.290
in

01:22:14.290 --> 01:22:18.900
[Laughter]

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.940
fact because it's actually doing a

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.840
time you know in this translation I'm

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.699
calling it translation because it's

01:22:26.699 --> 01:22:30.659
Realms you know so I think I'll just

01:22:30.659 --> 01:22:34.620
answer the question and end with a

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.659
quote that

01:22:36.659 --> 01:22:40.980
I wrote I think in the last Socrates I

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:42.600
can't remember where I write these

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.640
things anymore I've got so many

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.580
but it's a little quote that I wrote

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:50.340
It's from me and it says I want the

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.940
words to come out of my mouth the way I

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.020
want the dance to come out of my body

01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:01.219
entirely free of my mind

01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:04.380
that's how I write

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.000
that's how I wrote

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.170
[Music]

01:23:09.179 --> 01:23:12.600
Kimberly knows what I'm saying

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.000
I want the words to come out of my mouth

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.280
the way I want the dance to come out of

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.360
my body

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:23.360
I'm entirely free of my mind

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:27.080
thank you all for a wonderful

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.360
2023 session putting the Mind back into

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.120
the body and the body back into nature

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.100
will come back for a recap open

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.320
discussions

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:37.980
um

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:41.239
I'm gonna take a summer breath

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:45.739
thank you so much
