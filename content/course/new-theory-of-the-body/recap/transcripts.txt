## Cohort 1

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.060
good morning good afternoon good evening

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.359
Wherever You Are

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.760
One Planet many time zones

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.119
okay can you hear me oh something's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.140
wrong here let's see

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.980
um all right so it's open kind of open

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.640
conversation session

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.899
Holly did you cut your hair

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.040
oh

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.280
it looked like you had a real boycott

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.379
which it was cool that would have been

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.700
cool but

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.920
um okay sorry get distracted

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.180
um so we have two questions two prompts

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.059
and we could do this

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.680
uh in

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.840
um just one session or we could have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.640
maybe we should have breakout groups and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.079
see one two three four

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.640
three four seven eight nine

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.280
and maybe we could have two breakout

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.140
groups

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.060
and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
let's see and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.100
we'll mix up who you're with the second

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.020
time okay

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
um and or I'll just let the computer do

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.000
it it'll be somewhat mixed up or

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.420
something like that but we're gonna have

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.180
two questions and when you go on your

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.220
first group

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.580
okay I know how to do it okay

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.900
um

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.380
there's two questions so when we first

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.960
break out we you choose which question

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.700
you want to talk about okay in your

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.140
group

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.880
and then

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.119
um when we come back we'll

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.820
we'll make it so that you go in one room

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.560
if you want to tell about this question

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.119
you go in the other room it throws away

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.159
that question so you will be in groups

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.619
that talked about both questions does

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.880
that make sense

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.640
all right so I won't assign the question

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.380
to the first group you just feel like

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.700
what does that group want to talk about

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.159
but you'll get a chance to be with a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.659
group that wants to talk about the other

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.759
question in the second half

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.679
all right because one's kind of an

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.120
intellectual

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.840
um

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.720
lens and one is more of a feeling lens

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.099
so uh that's what it's the same question

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.680
from these two different lenses okay so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.760
I'm good

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.180
all right so the two questions are what

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.060
is new in a new theory of the body

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.700
so that's kind of the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.220
intellectual or propositional question

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.739
what is new in the new theory of the

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.980
body

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.660
thank you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.239
the second question is how do you relate

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.680
to your body or bodies differently now

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.959
Samuel said something wonderful about

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.140
the course on Twitter about how much how

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.780
different it is when

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.780
feels like a child in his body again

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.580
so it made me think of asking this

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.739
question so you see that they're really

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.379
two different lenses

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.440
um

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.040
and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.260
um yeah could you say the second

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.959
question again I missed it yeah how do

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.500
you relate to your body core bodies in

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.360
general uh differently now

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.060
and obviously there's overlap

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.099
um but in the first question we kind of

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.580
want to have

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.440
material for the the essay

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.239
also does that make sense

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
okay so if everybody takes the same one

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.580
then when you go back everybody can take

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.819
we can just have the same groups uh

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.659
force them

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.340
uh in some way to do the other thing

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.140
okay

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.799
um

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.640
let's see

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.620
oh I think I'll do three three okay

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.220
that's good and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.759
absolutely cool all right good

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.400
uh I'm gonna move this person John are

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.500
you real are you here here

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.040
well I didn't realize uh so I wasn't

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.199
prepared and I've got my day lined out

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.380
so okay so I'm gonna

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.080
yeah don't add me yeah you know I'm glad

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.120
you but I'm gonna add a fourth one of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.100
the rooms after four people and I'll put

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.720
the fourth person

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.280
in

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.300
um

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.139
uh I'll put the fourth person in with

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.500
you so that but I want this I don't want

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.000
this to happen either

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.560
and what are their instructions the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.060
people okay all right so

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.479
it's a person

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.199
uh this person

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.560
to that room whereas and then John's

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.060
gonna have

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.360
the fourth person not these guys so

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.680
okay

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.180
there

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.340
all right so John's in a room with four

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.900
people because there's one room who has

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.520
four people but he's not might not be

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.960
able to participate so it's actually

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.560
more balanced out now

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.380
um so let's do uh

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.780
let's do 45 minutes on the first one and

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.440
we'll do a shorter one on the second one

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.500
um yeah and you can go back and forth

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.479
between the questions obviously this is

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.180
not real rules okay enjoy your company

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.020
enjoy your conversation

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.300
so Brian the last the last edit you sent

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.759
me I don't even know which one it is

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.319
oh okay I I didn't know

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.259
I'm sorry I hope you understand I don't

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.360
sit here doing this I know they're good

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.539
if they pop out you know but I that one

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.940
I I read it I'm like well I could have

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.780
been

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.300
you know I get into these zones and I

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.060
start writing things and and it can be

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.240
powerful but like I don't even know what

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.160
the hell this old one was cute because

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.840
it could be that or it could be that so

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.080
I just left it done once I changed yeah

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.259
and that word inimical

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.139
that is I can't believe it doesn't mean

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.060
when I've always thought of me and I

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.680
always use that word

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.020
yeah I

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.780
I and I you know I've looked I look up

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.500
words I don't know yeah like really this

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.240
is the opposite of what I was trying to

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.180
say yeah it's like and then like like

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.259
yeah

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.660
so you didn't correct one that I that I

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.539
included in the PS well you have to send

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:38.580
that to me again then because it was

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.419
like

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.660
H low you know instead of I think it

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.860
can't tell if it's glow or flow or oh if

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.039
I don't find it I'll let you

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:51.240
know okay

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.680
okay

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.620
so how'd we do you had some sneaky

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.840
visitors come into your room some of you

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.560
um so my recording yeah all right so

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.720
what'd you come up with

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.800
I'll take notes

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.039
um aloha

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:19.099
yeah

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.080
I think maybe the sneaky visitors were

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.860
here all along

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:40.860
is that Zoe's mom

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.700
yeah that's my mom hello nice to see you

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.640
you couldn't tell you look alike

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.580
sorry I said you look like each other if

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.220
you if you changed glasses

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.820
all right we hardly know who was who

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.440
watched this watch the transformation

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.600
she looks more like her dad I think

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.800
really

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.600
he looks more like her dad yeah

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.360
all right yeah

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.720
go ahead Atlas was saying I I've not

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.380
visited before so it's like it's always

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.440
just introducing me to to what you're

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.080
doing and it sounds really really lovely

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.980
yeah yeah nice to meet you

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.360
yeah

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.620
just

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.660
crazy way we meet each other okay what'd

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.040
you guys talk about

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.500
did you it's okay if you just talk about

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.399
something else but

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.839
I can say that Samuel I did

00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.519
um

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:01.800
see your comment on Twitter which

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.680
created the second question how do you

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.019
relate to your body in a different way

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:08.040
now

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.220
and that you were saying that and I

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.320
guess combined with Alexander technique

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.399
which is a great methodology that your

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:20.160
feeling more like a younger

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.899
child like a young person

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.899
yeah yeah I was referencing this this

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:30.240
tweet uh I did like when I went when I

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.220
learned Alexander technique and there

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.959
was a moment where I really felt it so

00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:37.100
strongly and this was like

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.180
surprising shift

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.279
and and I remember saying okay that

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:43.019
that's going to be my default that I

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:44.600
want I want that as my teeth forward

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.420
exactly and yeah and I just could remind

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.660
it back to that uh

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.420
now with this module the last module and

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.320
just try to connect it in some ways uh

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.500
felt like yeah and just yeah just yeah I

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.720
mean this whole body knowledge makes it

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.700
even more like

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.660
um

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.519
before that was just like expanding

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:11.720
awareness whatever it can mean

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.540
reflex awareness is all just a word but

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.540
I know so much more about it yeah

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.040
and

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.140
there was like there was another course

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.180
that it was kind of technique and it was

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.279
some practice and I felt like man this

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.360
is this is

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.880
I felt it there also too and this was

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.760
just like connected out this way

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.980
uh

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.440
yeah so I would say that you know

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.790
obviously

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.860
[Music]

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.459
but like when I when I was doing this

00:11:47.459 --> 00:11:49.860
you know it was like I had my practice

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.899
with the horses in nature and then I had

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.760
my intellectual life and there was no

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.100
Bridge it was just like bouncing back

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.579
and forth and there was this sense that

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:02.760
the embodied work yeah that's good but

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.260
that's like

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.940
you got to get over that you know

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.959
everything is is all the

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:12.300
you know like the way you grow in

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.579
developmental stage there is you get

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:17.640
more and more sophisticated as a thinker

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.920
in this this has this uh I think what

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.660
you're saying or what I would add to it

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.600
is is that now someone who also is

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.600
interested in

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.120
Concepts and and

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.260
um

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.720
and all kinds of intellectual I mean we

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.920
all are

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.899
um we can see that there's a direct line

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:42.240
right down to the Bodywork you know it's

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.920
not like you do this and then you do

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.220
that or you do this so you can

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.079
get your energy out so you can do that

00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:51.060
there there

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.339
yeah they're one kind of

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:56.100
it's more integrative so

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.160
um

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.399
I was talking to Jonathan Rossum of

00:13:02.399 --> 00:13:04.440
perspectiva the other day and

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.300
and I was telling him how

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.360
that makes a difference when people

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.120
are saying young people who were born in

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.260
the internet age the digital Nomads

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.220
um

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.399
when they when when they realize that

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.320
rats consent you know other animal

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.600
animals can create simulations and then

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.100
rats can create hypothetical

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.899
environments in their sleep

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:33.600
are saying they just it's so meaningful

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.880
to them and he's like why

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.639
and I'm like because

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.920
you don't feel like you just cut off

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.720
like okay we're people we can run

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.420
simulations we live in a simulation

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.660
there is nature we're destroying nature

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.959
and you know and I was just saying just

00:13:51.959 --> 00:13:56.779
people knowing that it makes a big deal

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.420
then you can get curious like wow how

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.839
can I figure out like

00:14:03.839 --> 00:14:05.639
you know use that term like Michael

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:07.680
Levin does this how can I use that term

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.500
and not it's like Elon Musk we're just

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.079
in a simulation anyways or the Zen we

00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:14.820
don't even mean it like the Zen thing

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.519
like we don't mean that

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:19.740
it's a simulation and there's nothing

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.760
real

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.660
that's not what we mean we we mean

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.560
something else so anyways

00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:35.700
um

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.079
so

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:39.000
this is what I shared in the group I

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.940
haven't I've been involved

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.480
um with um my son who's fixing up a

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.199
house

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:48.480
but more than that and so so I've been

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.180
drawn physically I've been drawn to be

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.899
quite engaged and less

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:58.019
um I don't have I don't have a space to

00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:00.480
read right now and I don't have space to

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.220
be in in here as much as as as as as

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.000
following like

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.120
this much larger sense of energy moving

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.620
and participating

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.579
and um

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.339
a question I wanted to answer but here's

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:19.699
the answer

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.260
um

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.019
and so I thought okay I haven't been

00:15:25.019 --> 00:15:26.760
part of the pop-up

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.540
and as much as I would like and

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.320
um

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.480
but the feeling is

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.160
in the body

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.019
that um that all of that that's

00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:42.660
that's it's all like my body is like

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.720
this huge antenna or something and that

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.880
and that it's

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.880
and the trusting

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.779
um

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.380
where I'm drawn and and being as wide

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.019
open as I can in that that that's that

00:15:58.019 --> 00:15:59.880
that's part of it and that I'm part of

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:05.060
this uh unfolding and um

00:16:07.079 --> 00:16:08.519
I don't know there was something that

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:10.199
you said earlier that both of you said

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:14.240
that I wanted to respond to but um

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.880
and it feels like that that like the the

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.459
locus

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:22.920
of

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.260
understanding

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.560
and the locus of New Life

00:16:32.579 --> 00:16:35.880
is all over all over the place

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.459
and it's not

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:40.980
uh it doesn't come from

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.019
figuring anything out

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:47.540
that's way too slow

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:51.660
but but it comes from

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.720
um

00:16:54.899 --> 00:16:59.100
being as available as I possibly can

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.100
um

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:04.140
you know to

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.839
to what's moving me and then having the

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.660
understanding

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.620
to trust that

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.339
um which is which is developed

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:21.199
it isn't I don't arrive at that

00:17:21.199 --> 00:17:24.360
just from experience experience sort of

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.980
has to be

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.880
um

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.880
questions

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.679
it's like if you were playing incredibly

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.960
beautiful music

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.500
and you're very very skilled

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500
so that the music itself

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.760
can come through your hands

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.720
um

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.000
your hands are part of it but they're

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.100
but they're skilled enough to get out of

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.400
the way

00:17:57.299 --> 00:17:59.580
I don't know if I said anything no no

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.500
you know dude I've had this recurring

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.179
dream

00:18:03.179 --> 00:18:05.700
and I've never been actually able to do

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.940
it well in real life and that is

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.919
I'm this pianist

00:18:10.919 --> 00:18:16.700
and it's kind of like uh what's his name

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.740
he did lausanne and Bremen he's this

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.360
jazz pianist he's amazing

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.299
anyways we're like you just speak

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:35.100
directly through the playing the piano

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.360
you know and when I've tried to do that

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.620
um

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.539
you know not in front of an audience or

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:45.840
anything I I find I get into I get into

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.960
habits that I've learned it's very hard

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.260
to like know the piano so well that

00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:00.780
there's as much character in what you're

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.120
playing as

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.820
is arising in your

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.740
yeah

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.740
um

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.200
a kind of similar when you do extratic

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.559
Dance I mean like you you also

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:27.059
have to find yourself in repeated

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:29.100
patterns and then you see your breakout

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.140
but then it's still kind of like a

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.360
pattern

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.480
and it's really

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.240
feel like there's uh there's a

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.760
completely new happening it's

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.419
so easy

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.360
oh we're I'm still unmuted

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.480
um

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:08.520
we spent our breakout mostly talking

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.020
about

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.020
the second all the way we were all

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.660
talking about the second question

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.400
and it was really

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
from my

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.580
Viewpoint intimate

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.620
rather than

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.500
conceptual

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.000
and um

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.480
I think that that's symbolic of 2023

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.280
pop-up

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.960
that we've

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.320
come into relationship

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.820
in a clearer

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.580
caring way with each other trying to

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.440
figure out this thing called the new

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.360
theory of the body

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.160
that it's

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.160
through

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.880
our bodies and we spent very little time

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.240
talking about

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.900
relating to bodies differently

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.200
it seemed

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.720
our focused in the breakout was more

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.840
about how we relate to our bodies

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.799
differently

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:30.500
and my sense is that

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.980
we need to dig a Little Deeper to get to

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.240
the first question

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.260
how now

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.400
are we sensing a new Theory of the body

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.720
through how we relate to

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.059
the world differently

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:55.260
other bodies human non-human visible not

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.760
visible

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.940
that was my clip about new people

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.340
entering the rooms maybe they're here

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.159
you know the invisible bodies maybe

00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:08.640
there's something else here you know so

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.900
um

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.179
I think that that the two questions

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:14.480
aren't separate I think they're really

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.440
dovetailed into each other and there is

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.840
a beauty in

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.000
starting at home where you're sitting

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:32.700
and there's there's a a spaciousness

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.320
that I feel

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.220
In My World Views this year in the

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.880
pop-up School

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.559
my experience has been slightly

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:18.900
different from what David was describing

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.900
and that I've been noticing that I'm

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.200
actually drawing on the world around me

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.600
to know my own body better

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.520
and so

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.159
um that there's a choice to

00:23:32.159 --> 00:23:34.620
look around me and

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.440
tend to

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.000
the world

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.360
which has a lot of Stillness and dynamic

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.179
movement in it

00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:46.919
and to see how that is actually

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:49.140
reflecting

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.039
what's here

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.340
the whole thing is like a

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:09.059
yeah

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:11.039
they also came to the conclusion in our

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:13.320
group which was great that the pop-up

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.840
school is actually a rehab center for to

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.840
rehab all the malware so we're all

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.360
addicts getting help

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.380
no the malware goes very deep you know

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.940
um

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.320
which is

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.559
uh yeah

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:34.620
it's um

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.220
that's the actual you know I get what

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.340
David is saying it the we're using our

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.120
bodies more and interpreting less but

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.340
people have also been very good at being

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.100
able to notice and let go of the malware

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.780
uh even when there's nothing to put it

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.780
in its place like sometimes we have like

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.120
little theories you can hold on to or

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.900
but even when we had like

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.059
some of these sessions where we come to

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:07.860
a conclusion and it's really cool then

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.840
the next session is fresh again it's not

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:14.100
like we don't like latch on to

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.100
um

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.200
and then make it all about what that

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.820
great Insight that we experience

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.799
together at the time before which is

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:25.380
what communities usually do and then

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.299
they latch onto it and become a cult or

00:25:27.299 --> 00:25:29.520
they have a doc you know it becomes the

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.100
Dogma the Dharma so

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.140
um yeah so

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.419
it's not

00:25:36.419 --> 00:25:40.320
it's not easy to so they call a hand in

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.360
hand so the more everybody trusted each

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.820
other the less

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.940
scary it is to

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.039
actually allow some of the deep

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:51.779
criticisms of some of the things you

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:56.340
really love or spent your time doing

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.039
um allow that to dissolve

00:25:59.039 --> 00:26:00.779
um

00:26:00.779 --> 00:26:04.080
it's not easy you know it's not

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.940
it's not easy and

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.279
there's something going on where you you

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:13.679
you know that the purpose of the pop-up

00:26:13.679 --> 00:26:17.039
school is to be not contracted

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:19.140
but a lot of the

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.620
Journey you know you you go through

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.039
these contracted states that are part of

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:27.740
the

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.980
attacking the mental malware

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.960
um not some you know David's going like

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.600
this you you all are pretty good but if

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.539
you remember early on it's a lot it's a

00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:42.440
lot harder because

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.659
and even like our new theory of the body

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:55.940
is more of a

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.600
[Music]

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.260
a handbook for for going through a

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.539
journey then

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.640
creating an actual

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.500
you know they're just like the Alexandra

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.000
technique it's

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.400
when you're teaching it yeah you have in

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.860
qigong's the same way you describe

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.900
things in certain ways and you have

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.260
ideas and stuff but it's really just the

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.200
physical Journey that uh

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.140
is you know 99.9 of everything

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:05.419
so we um

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.240
I'm not sure we did a great job of of

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.940
deciding to answer one or two in our

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.559
group we

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:18.179
we so we I think we focused on

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:19.440
you know

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.960
the how we relate to our own our bodies

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.179
but we but we also

00:28:24.179 --> 00:28:26.520
drifted into

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.500
question number one

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.539
you know the

00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:33.840
you know for me the the

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.840
I forget where where I where you wrote

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.240
it but you talked about the bee in the

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.940
city being brought out to the

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.620
Countryside and and that disorientation

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.220
of of

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.600
re connecting with their beingness and

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.200
that toggle

00:28:57.659 --> 00:28:59.640
um

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.380
of you know

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.919
in in in in in that in that for at least

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:11.100
for me it was like oh you know and and

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.559
maybe this is combining some of the the

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:18.059
before Socrates work you know that that

00:29:18.059 --> 00:29:21.059
picturing

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.799
a human human before language and before

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:32.539
um and and then not not not not uh

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:36.120
recognizing that that that

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.059
in toggling to this

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:43.940
humanness you know didn't didn't

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:46.260
um

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.720
you know and Christopher Alexander came

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.500
up

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.659
um in our group as well something that

00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:52.559
that

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.960
a quote that that you'd used

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.260
you know and thinking about his work and

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.380
you know he still built he still shaped

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.320
the landscape he built buildings and and

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.140
um

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.120
so not thinking that

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.020
um

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.899
it was just that that toggle of being

00:30:15.899 --> 00:30:20.220
disoriented and reoriented and that this

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.960
has been this

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.120
Journey for me in answering that

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.220
question of how I relate to the bot you

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:26.940
know

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.700
this to my body differently and

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:34.380
continuing to experience that

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.360
um

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.360
in in this process this year and

00:30:57.899 --> 00:31:01.140
so in in in our group Holly Holly has

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.179
already spoken but Sandra was in it and

00:31:03.179 --> 00:31:06.659
Samuel came a little bit later and we we

00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:10.020
tackle the second question

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.940
and but we quite quickly moved to

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.360
describing bodies as well initially like

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.679
bodies of people automatically

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:21.799
coordinating crazy traffic situations

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:25.740
like cyclists and trans you know moving

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.559
really fast and somehow not crashing a

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.120
kind of

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.500
um so we spoke about that and then

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.899
Sandra spoke we spoke about

00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:36.919
storm that Sandra had experienced and

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:39.779
what nature was saying what that body

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.240
that what that nature was what what the

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.159
storm was saying what

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:48.659
so body became nature quite quickly and

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:52.020
body also became reality

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.460
quite quickly in terms of

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.799
I was talking about how there's a kind

00:31:58.799 --> 00:31:59.460
of

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.960
I keep getting saved by my reality

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.840
um a kind of Regulation

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.620
um

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.620
comes in and I think and

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.380
when when I when I notice it it's it's

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.659
it's there um and then I think Holly

00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:17.580
took it

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.799
a step further

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:22.700
into into

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.980
a kind of communication

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.100
um

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.520
so these were all beautiful Reflections

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.220
I thought on kind of quite personal

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.279
Reflections on on how we related to it

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:40.500
and then we you know we also brought in

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.899
a little bit of the the sadness for me

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:45.120
anyway I felt the sadness of how often

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.700
it's occluded you know we were talking

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.880
about the malware we wear malware as a

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.980
kind of sensory shroud right

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.779
um and we become

00:32:57.779 --> 00:33:00.600
well we can't see but we also can't be

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.000
found somehow we're not findable and we

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.460
were we had a little anecdote of birds

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.580
screaming at us saying you know

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.760
come on you know wake up you know you

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.740
you can't see us you're not findable

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.559
right now and how often maybe nature is

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:18.539
saying that

00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:19.559
um

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:21.840
and you know that came with with with

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.220
with some sadness

00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:34.080
new line I have a new line malware a

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:35.580
little fashion line

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.720
up

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.120
uh and you're not findable so these are

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.720
all great

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.159
yeah it goes to both ways right

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:08.399
yeah there's something about that you're

00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:12.800
not findable which I mean I I get

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.060
and

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.440
it means immediately it uh it just drips

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.020
with sadness

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.540
and yet I'm wondering if that's

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.480
if it's I mean it's accurate on one

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.720
level

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.700
but the fact of saying it

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.639
um

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.560
if I can recognize the observation

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.940
I'm immediately findable

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:50.399
um

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:53.339
and so it's

00:34:53.339 --> 00:34:57.540
I I don't have to imagine myself as the

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.820
perpetrator or the victim of my

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.540
separation

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.119
because I'm immediately findable

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.160
even when I'm not

00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:25.320
so would you say then it's more like I

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.200
think we understand the the move but

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.839
it's more like we run we walk around as

00:35:30.839 --> 00:35:34.440
if we're not findable hence we're not we

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.960
go that's our Mantra we're not findable

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.320
but then it's immediately as you notice

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.300
the as if

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.079
then you get the switch that Rey Rey is

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.579
talking about

00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:50.300
correct

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.980
and and for me anyway to recognize that

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.900
they're not I mean the presence of one

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.339
is the presence of the other

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.500
that actually pings back on the Good

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.660
Samaritan very much so I've been reading

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.940
a lot of iliads because I'm going to be

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.579
doing a course for parallax

00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:16.020
and

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.140
um

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.220
he talks about that how with the

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.520
institutionalization of the service

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.140
uh

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.960
with the institutionalization of care

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.500
erad people of the need and the

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.900
possibility of discovering the other

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.300
who's in need and they're no longer

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.280
findable I mean that's a it's a

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.160
interesting thing to that

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.140
um and he's and he says

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.060
it creates a society where there's never

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.720
enough Health Never Enough education and

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.560
never enough money

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.680
so that that touches on uh something

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.440
that came up for me right at the end of

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.900
our group

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.339
um

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:20.339
where

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.420
um

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.359
that was

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.640
uh reminding myself of different

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.700
um ways that I've experienced like the

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.920
the the the curriculum of the course

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.000
over the over the years and what's

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.520
what's being integrated what's not how

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.740
does it show up and

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.640
um and then right at the end I came to

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.579
uh thinking about my work and how I show

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:52.740
up in work context

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.220
and particularly

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:58.500
like I often have to travel great

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.400
distances to get to places that you know

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.140
where the work is

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.880
and

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:08.880
um and a lot of the work is I guess

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.820
you could say it's framed around service

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.599
which means that there's an elaborate

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:20.280
justification system that is sort of

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.640
built into it and it's so easy to get

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.859
kind of

00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:28.040
um

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.300
multiple visitors

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.540
excuse

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.540
me

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.800
yeah go ahead and Marie

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.520
[Music]

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.140
um

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.119
well it's a photo bombing you but just

00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:59.060
yeah

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.940
which helps to make my point that when

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.579
you know when there's elaborate

00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:08.280
justifications that are surrounding the

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.320
work that we do it makes it harder just

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.740
to drop into being a body in space and

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:16.020
showing up and letting that sort of all

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.000
fall to the

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.599
to the Wayside and let it be enough to

00:39:21.599 --> 00:39:24.000
just show up and

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.339
um uh

00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:29.460
uh and be present to what's what's

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:34.400
actually there and uh what's possible

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.160
so this is actually a big question for

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.780
me because

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.359
you know I was at uh

00:39:42.359 --> 00:39:45.300
uh Symposium in Vermont and Greg

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.760
Enriquez was there I had occasion to

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.420
talk to him

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.420
and we really tried to get on the same

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.540
page with this notion of justification

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.000
and and

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.520
it was very frustrating you know because

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.579
he was trying really hard

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:09.240
um and and I was trying really hard and

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:13.260
it was like two people having a zero

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.079
communication literally like like

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:18.480
literally I just couldn't

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.200
like like

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.560
because

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:29.940
everything I said he's he because he has

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.180
this this model

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.300
and then you have mine three is

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.240
the justification system The Narrative

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.040
and justification system

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.800
so everything I said he was like well

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.079
that's just justification but I was

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:49.500
trying to point to something that wasn't

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:54.960
justification right and I I was not able

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:59.099
to say yes but

00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:02.280
we happen to be talking but we could

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.339
actually

00:41:04.339 --> 00:41:07.380
climb a mountain

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.960
and something could happen right so

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.060
don't I know I'm justifying my position

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.640
right now like I was in this Loop do you

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.980
see what I'm saying because because we

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.320
were talking about everything to him

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.200
nothing could Point outside of the

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.599
dialogical loop

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:27.000
and

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.220
you know I started with the animals

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.619
consumerately went and then we got to

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:35.040
the justification system for him

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.740
it tops off you know the next thing for

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.079
him is AI

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:43.260
Ai and it's an it's an emergent new

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.660
level of mind

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:49.579
and I thought wow like

00:41:52.339 --> 00:41:55.200
this it's so claustrophobic like you get

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.960
to mind the type of Minds human have and

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.660
it's all the justification system

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.060
and then the only the only thing out is

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.960
to level up is what they like to say and

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.380
now you have mind four which is a i

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.720
interface with

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.859
humans and I'm not 100 against AI

00:42:19.859 --> 00:42:22.020
interface with humans but you see how

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:24.300
it's laid out in his mind that was just

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:26.400
not going to only accelerate the Justice

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.040
there's no orthogonal move

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.220
like like there's no move to be like in

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.760
your body and then use AI

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.260
cleverly like I said to rear back what

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.839
if what if we used AI

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:42.000
what if we invited AI into Collective

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.480
presidency

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.220
because people get these hits and they

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:50.460
they say a phrase and then they get

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.680
to stay in their body get too locked up

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.780
and you can't talk

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.119
now ai won't make much sense out of it

00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.619
but it can generate all kinds of

00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:00.359
gibberish and then you can get a hit

00:43:00.359 --> 00:43:03.000
like oh you know what I'm saying anyways

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.700
my point was is I'm not totally against

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.200
AI but

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.240
the way it's set up is it's it's

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.420
everything is jammed into this

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:19.520
this ladder that keeps you know

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.000
he asked me to weigh and watch his and

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.359
John's first two

00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:30.000
transcendental naturalism videos and

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.099
they just like yeah something's emerging

00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:34.319
we're leveling up like everything is

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:37.079
just jammed in on top of all the malware

00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:39.599
there's no way to get out there's no

00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:42.000
there's no exit

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.040
there's no exit

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.720
in

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.319
what they how they View

00:43:49.319 --> 00:43:51.119
the world

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.680
that we're just going to be more and

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.900
more similar you know more and more yeah

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.780
I find it very

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.480
frustrating because I can tell he's you

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.119
know he's positively motivated to

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:07.500
understand

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.040
sort of a little bit of a one-track mind

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.700
there but

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.420
it's like he you can he he has

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.020
because I complained he did add he used

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.760
to call it behavioral mind and now he

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:27.060
calls it animal mind not animal behavior

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.579
which is a big improval

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:30.900
sort of

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:33.540
but for him

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.480
it's like it's one and done okay now but

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.339
now that's in our past

00:44:38.339 --> 00:44:40.500
we have that but now we have the you

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.220
know

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.119
and that's not the way I see it like

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:48.800
it's not one and done

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.760
but the justification I've got to think

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.700
more about that because I wasn't able to

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.380
make

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:02.300
clear enough distinctions

00:45:06.839 --> 00:45:09.180
I did point out the difference between

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.599
Barack Obama's Nobel Prize speech and

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:14.700
bios

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.540
article

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.859
but he would just see them as different

00:45:19.859 --> 00:45:22.680
justification systems

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.280
like

00:45:25.319 --> 00:45:28.460
I don't know it's weird

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.760
it sounds like you would have to do some

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.400
sense breaking

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.220
to even

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.420
move through that

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.640
it's it's that point at which I think

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.339
this pings back to

00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:58.859
David and that is

00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:01.740
when I'm talking to Greg it's just a

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.680
language model and you can't no matter

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.540
like in the pop-up school there's a

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.579
point at which someone uses like this

00:46:08.579 --> 00:46:12.300
this what Ray just said it's not the

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.640
words the words was doing something to

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.099
our bodies right so that's real

00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:19.980
communication like it's what happened

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.280
between Holly and Claudia and Ray like

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.880
something actually

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.060
moved us moved our innards right like

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.460
and so that's how those words were

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.380
functioning

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.420
um and

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.960
with talking to people like

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.400
Greg

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.480
like every once in a while I'll drop in

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.660
and and he he got he melted he felt

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.780
really sweet right but then once you use

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:56.240
language you can't use it as

00:46:58.319 --> 00:47:02.220
an action protocol you can't use it to

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.079
switch

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:08.280
ah I see you and I looking at it from

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.880
different what perspectives okay now

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.040
we can talk about this whole other way

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.859
of looking at it and it was impossible

00:47:16.859 --> 00:47:20.220
very you know it's the same challenge I

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.200
had with verveiki when I talked to

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.260
verbaki and Thomas duninger

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.880
um

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.000
a little bit challenging with soyu that

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.339
that video interview wasn't great but

00:47:32.339 --> 00:47:35.880
I've had experiences with him that are

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.560
cut through language so

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.339
so I'm I'm wondering if I'm using the

00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.800
term correctly or in the way that you

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.079
intended it with the with my example

00:47:49.079 --> 00:47:51.000
because

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.500
I think what I was trying to get at is

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.460
the way in which like

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.480
um

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.880
certain

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.440
um

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.160
uh

00:48:08.099 --> 00:48:13.079
in in my case so the work ends up being

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:16.079
um it has certain language it's built

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.579
into

00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:22.619
um uh structures of bureaucracy and and

00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:25.079
um and that's how it's carried out and

00:48:25.079 --> 00:48:26.700
you have

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.220
um all of these systems that sort of

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:31.260
enable

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:35.099
um the work to take place and and and

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:37.800
and what I was more and more noticing is

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.740
how everyone is relating to that that it

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.380
ends up structuring what it is how we're

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.960
in relationship with one another and

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.960
what is sort of lost are uh bodies in

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:53.160
space

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.160
and and how

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.819
um and and this relates to

00:48:59.819 --> 00:49:02.339
um a trajectory of my experience with

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:05.460
this work where I had to there was a

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.760
disintegration of the sense of what kind

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.420
of impact is this work having or what is

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:15.180
its intention or how best to do it and

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.280
being preoccupied with those kind of

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.800
conversations and having those like

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:23.160
completely fall away and just not have

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.260
any grip at all anymore and not having

00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.680
anything to replace them for a long time

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.900
and then coming to

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:34.680
um this last trip I took was like just

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.640
um

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.000
being interested in

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.119
who's in the room and who am I and

00:49:42.119 --> 00:49:45.119
what's possible here yeah so those

00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:48.119
systems those bureaucratic systems and

00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:51.540
you know and this is how he uses the

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.700
term justification system so there's a

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.720
law there's international law there's

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.480
rules of in all these things

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.540
um are

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.540
his claim would be that without

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:08.400
justification systems you couldn't have

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.900
collective intelligence and I mean there

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.060
is there look there's a great deal of

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:17.819
practical truth to that you know and in

00:50:17.819 --> 00:50:21.300
terms of but everything is very holistic

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.579
right because

00:50:23.579 --> 00:50:25.319
um

00:50:25.319 --> 00:50:28.560
nature doesn't have any uh justification

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.720
systems and there's obviously it's

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.880
collective intelligence right it's

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.079
integrated holistic intelligence and

00:50:37.079 --> 00:50:40.619
um but once you everything we talk about

00:50:40.619 --> 00:50:42.180
is all

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.400
Kings back to everything else once you

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.160
imagine a future of global Mass

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.260
coordination of bodies

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.599
then you need justification systems

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.160
because you need to standardize

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.099
everything right and

00:50:56.099 --> 00:50:59.880
um so yes on a certain level

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:01.940
um

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.540
I'm not saying they're all bad but what

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.119
happens in his model is eliminates the

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:11.280
possibility that

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.579
you can feel like but there's a way out

00:51:14.579 --> 00:51:16.980
there's a way of being that that doesn't

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.440
have to be inside and then of course

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.380
your your dream is what if I could do

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.380
the work that I want to do work and I

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.220
could

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.339
leverage this way of being that's not

00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:31.380
like that I mean and then you start to

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.020
imagine it so clearly you can taste it

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.119
and then it's

00:51:35.119 --> 00:51:36.740
profoundly

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.420
impossible right because

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.700
because of the density of the

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:44.579
justification system so

00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:45.839
um

00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:47.700
uh

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.099
yeah that tension is frustrating but

00:51:50.099 --> 00:51:52.800
it's also very interesting like to keep

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.839
going through the emotions and always be

00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:57.619
asking like

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:00.540
you know that thing I talked about and

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.640
the wisdom is like yeah this feels so

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.859
claustrophobic and yet I know there's

00:52:04.859 --> 00:52:06.359
like a rule

00:52:06.359 --> 00:52:08.400
like a natural

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.760
law that there is enough space right for

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.680
the light to get through so this

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.119
interesting way to

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.960
keep it in your face and keep asking the

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.599
question you know

00:52:27.599 --> 00:52:30.240
I love your expression the density of

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.540
the justification systems and and it's

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.359
as if once you're inside of that the

00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:39.839
only way through is born more elaborate

00:52:39.839 --> 00:52:42.960
and maybe more subtle justification

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.720
systems but they're not

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.500
uh they're still staying within the

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.640
Safety and Security of that density and

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.220
what happens if we

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.420
Trust

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.140
that there's something that's more

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.140
porous and something that's more alive

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.420
and uh

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.599
and one way that I am learning to

00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:13.980
practice that is if it doesn't feel good

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:17.359
it's not true

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:21.660
and so then the question is what feels

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.559
good

00:53:22.559 --> 00:53:24.240
what is true

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.400
and to lift myself like yesterday I had

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.859
a very reactive

00:53:28.859 --> 00:53:31.380
to something that wasn't true but I was

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.000
engaging

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.599
at that level and there's no new space

00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:39.480
in that so

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.079
what is true I have to find a place

00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:45.359
where given that

00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:49.020
I can feel something new I can feel

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.020
expansive

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.680
um

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:55.140
and I can feel

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.200
um that I am not

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:00.300
the source

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.160
of the new

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.940
but there is something that is

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.140
um available

00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.240
um

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:14.420
and um

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.500
my response when you tell a story about

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:21.000
this guy is anger and it's like it's

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.260
like

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:25.260
um hubris it's like get off your

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:29.460
freaking head you know and

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.160
um and so I want to say that

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.920
the other day

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.839
I'm at David's house

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:41.040
and these two young men came plumbers

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.339
and they were glorious

00:54:44.339 --> 00:54:48.180
they just were beautiful and I said to

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.260
them

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.180
you are such

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.720
beautiful men

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.040
and they had

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.099
so much uh

00:55:01.099 --> 00:55:04.800
positivity and and uh

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.359
I don't know if I can recreate but

00:55:06.359 --> 00:55:10.380
they're just full of the life force of

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.640
service

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.900
and kindness and creativity and problem

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.319
solving and it was so beautiful and

00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:21.300
humble

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.180
and this young man Paul said nobody's

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:27.000
ever said that to me before

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.680
it's like we've lost the robustness

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.559
uh and the and the um

00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:37.559
limitlessness

00:55:38.579 --> 00:55:40.680
of male

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.579
prowess

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:47.040
and male goodness

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.820
in this

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:49.020
[Music]

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.020
um

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:54.119
battle

00:55:54.119 --> 00:55:57.119
to conquer

00:55:57.119 --> 00:56:01.020
the mental territory in a way

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.220
um

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.680
and and

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.000
it all feels doesn't feel good and so

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.359
what feels good is

00:56:12.359 --> 00:56:13.980
uh

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.440
well I won't answer that question that's

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.720
an ongoing question laughs

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.720
yeah so my my failure came yesterday to

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:26.940
shoot the horses and he has a broken leg

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.640
he's kind of

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.280
hard luck guy but he has

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.040
a helper who just started out with him a

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:37.140
few months ago who had to do a lot of

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:39.540
the work right and

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.300
I noticed that in the 12 weeks that

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.520
between when I saw him last time like

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:48.180
how how how how good that kid had gotten

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.579
you know and I and I told them it was

00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:54.020
the same thing like he

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.119
he goes around showing horses for people

00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:58.920
I'm not rich but a lot of rich people

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.260
and they're just they're just peasants

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:03.000
you know like they're just

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.500
because of this whole

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.260
inflation we have we have this like

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:14.099
secret ladder of values where this you

00:57:14.099 --> 00:57:15.900
know that's just that's just peasant

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.040
work or something but I uh when you were

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.599
saying this I got this

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.300
um what came into me is another kind of

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:28.859
integration of what we were talking

00:57:28.859 --> 00:57:31.200
about and that is when Marie was talking

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.480
and we were talking about being dense

00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.599
and claustrophobic also you could have

00:57:36.599 --> 00:57:38.400
this thought experiment when you're in

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.980
that situation of

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.200
you know so it's very bureaucratic and

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.940
you got to do all this stuff and then

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.280
you could keep telling yourself but I'm

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.180
findable like me Marie at this desk then

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.500
that doesn't look like they're looking

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.579
at me

00:57:53.579 --> 00:57:57.079
but if you just like but I am findable

00:57:57.079 --> 00:58:00.720
and this can really help just shapeshift

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.960
your posture or something you know where

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:07.859
where and then someone is like oh that's

00:58:07.859 --> 00:58:10.319
not the lady who who shuffles paper

00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:14.940
that's Marie and that also is a is a and

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.700
and and so you what the plumbers weren't

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:21.059
doing that but they were surprised you

00:58:21.059 --> 00:58:22.619
know they were surprised that they were

00:58:22.619 --> 00:58:24.780
findable

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:27.480
then you found them right so somehow

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.240
this is all that cool little

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.559
conversation

00:58:31.559 --> 00:58:34.200
I just want to say that that's a

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.059
beautiful way of thinking about they

00:58:36.059 --> 00:58:38.640
didn't know they were findable and yet

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.680
here they were

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.640
um

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.460
fixing the pipe

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.920
for the washing machine that washes the

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.160
clothes that was so

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.660
uh

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.520
um closed in

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:56.000
uh with gunk

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.180
so so the work they did was to come

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.460
clean the pipe so that the water could

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.440
come through and the clothes could be

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.480
clean it's such a beautiful metaphor of

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.440
um

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.440
yes we have to be awake to being

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.480
findable

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.240
but and uh

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.040
maybe I don't know that's all I wanted

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.799
to say you know what breaks my heart if

00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:27.180
I can expand on this is

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:28.680
um

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.260
like years ago I've been in the trades

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:33.059
for a long time right in landscape

00:59:33.059 --> 00:59:35.339
construction hired a lot of years ago

00:59:35.339 --> 00:59:38.940
you would never see

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:41.819
less than a two or three man crew fixing

00:59:41.819 --> 00:59:43.980
the telephone poles

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.920
and now you see one guy in a truck

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.260
I think that it breaks my heart all

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.920
these traits like it's hard work and the

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:55.740
and part of what is good about it is

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.720
doing it with another person and it's

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.260
jovion it's got this male like you said

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.079
this young thing and when I see those

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:06.900
guys like in the pouring rain

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.180
because they have it's all automated in

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.880
their own but it just it breaks my heart

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.520
they spend all day alone

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.599
it breaks my heart

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.880
yeah Phoebe I don't know if this is part

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.640
of your experience but like as you were

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.740
talking about those plumbers and

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.780
revealing something in them you were

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.000
helping reveal something already in the

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.619
I almost get this since too at least

01:00:34.619 --> 01:00:36.299
when I've had similar experiences that

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:39.240
something in you also gets revealed you

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:40.740
know like it's

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.980
it it moves and so it's beautiful

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:45.480
because it draws something out in you as

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.240
well to to notice that and to highlight

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.540
that

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.359
well I'll be more

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:58.140
transparent I was so

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:01.799
odd by the beauty of these men and this

01:01:01.799 --> 01:01:03.660
one in particular one was named Luke and

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.180
one was named Paul talk about biblical

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:10.500
names and I was talking to Paul

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.839
and the more I

01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:16.260
I just felt the hunger for being

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.960
findable to use that language and the

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.859
more I felt him the more findable he

01:01:22.859 --> 01:01:27.000
became and the and more real it was it

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.740
was uh and his own then he started

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:29.819
talking about his own meditation

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:33.240
practice and and going to Indonesia to

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:36.240
go surfing and but it was very tender

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.520
and very beautiful and at the same time

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.880
I just felt this streaming energy coming

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.619
through me

01:01:43.619 --> 01:01:45.960
um that uh

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.220
uh I I was such Grace that

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.119
that I could

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.780
um

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.780
be in this dream of findability

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.200
of goodness of

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.880
care and

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.980
seeing

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.619
uh I just want to paint a picture of the

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:18.119
situation I was standing there writing a

01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:19.140
check

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.940
or the service

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.140
and I hadn't been given the amount

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:30.079
and this energy came through Phoebe

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:35.220
and I was able to open a door for my

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.220
robust

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:40.940
manhood as well

01:02:41.339 --> 01:02:44.339
and I think that the um

01:02:44.339 --> 01:02:47.339
the uh pop-up School

01:02:47.339 --> 01:02:52.740
percolating and bubbling in all of us is

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.220
to find

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.319
opportunities that present themselves in

01:02:58.319 --> 01:03:02.880
real life just in the daily living

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.020
to

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.240
break through

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.839
just to break the F through

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.720
but when I'm getting uh from

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.839
because we have we're having work done

01:03:33.839 --> 01:03:35.700
on our roof we've done a lot of

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.440
Renovations we have workers coming

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.460
through here all the time and I love

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.880
knowing how like becoming familiar with

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.740
their

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.619
their culture and how they they relate

01:03:49.619 --> 01:03:51.960
to one another either like within a

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.900
group and across groups and I don't

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.260
think it's that dissimilar in my own uh

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.380
job situation where I know how to

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.920
operate in that system and

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.819
um and that can either be what drives me

01:04:08.819 --> 01:04:11.700
or I can just know that in order to be

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.000
how to function and then

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.140
and then something else can also happen

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.940
um so it's not that

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.040
are yeah

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.680
um what I was calling the justification

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.140
system it's more than that it's just

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.720
it's it's ways that we know each other

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.260
in a context and we can understand

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.180
uh you know this person belongs here

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.579
that person doesn't and then you get

01:04:38.579 --> 01:04:41.220
that kind of fluentness in a certain

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.760
context and

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.380
um

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.040
and then more possibly can happen

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.819
I don't know

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.140
you can hear the birds

01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:24.020
outside

01:05:32.819 --> 01:05:35.400
okay I think this was a very great

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.920
conversation

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.540
thank you so much for

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.640

these wonderful insights

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.640
um

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:49.980
they're very powerful you know it's a

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.119
very powerful in science

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.000
thank you so much

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780
video

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.799
I'm trying to remember the name of it I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.280
sh I'll put it in the in the show notes

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
of the recap of this video

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.479
and it's about these

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.400
three women

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.119
who

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.579
conceive of an expedition conceive of

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.619
something they want to do and what they

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.020
want to do is roll

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.159
around the world

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.000
and so

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.659
and there's a crew of three no crew of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.520
four

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.740
and what they do is something like I'm

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.640
gonna get it wrong but like

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.420
they're couples in the first pair of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.000
rows for like eight hours

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.280
and then they eat and go to sleep and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.819
the second pair Rose to eight hours and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.580
they eat and go to sleep 24 hours a day

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.379
seven days a week 30 days a year a month

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.379
this is their routine like that's all

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.560
that's all they're doing that's all

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.319
they're doing right

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.840
and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.640
but

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
they realize like the first four people

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.940
one of them

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.519
can only make the first

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.580
uh phase it's like it's in four three or

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.099
four I think in three phases like they

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.160
can only make it from San Francisco

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.140
California to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.379
okay Hawaii or something and then Hawaii

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.500
to whatever and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.860
so they have to lose one of the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.920
participants in each one of these stages

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.879
and what's very very interesting is

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.300
when they get to the next stage and this

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.819
they start off with three p four people

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.440
who are rowers like like competitive

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.319
athletic Olympic Olympian rowers

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.140
and then when they get to the next thing

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.420
they take someone who like

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.780
kind of knows how to row

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.420
but has a good attitude and when they

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420
get to the next phase

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.640
they take someone who's never been on a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.239
boat before

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.739
and then when they get to Australia then

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.959
they get to someone I think no the next

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.299
space they get someone who's never rode

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.519
before and they get to Australia to make

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.360
the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.040
final round

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.480
This Woman's never been on a boat before

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.379
and oh uh losing side of shore it's a

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.640
great video

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.319
and why it's an amazing it's an amazing

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.000
documentary

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.600
because they begin to understand

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.359
that they don't need to add a fourth

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.979
rower

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.040
they need to add a naive perspective

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.720
a sophisticated naive perspective

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.040
to get them going

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.380
it's a completely underrated film

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.080
because most people just see it as like

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.639
some kind of like

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.120
physical documentary about like some

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.759
physical

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.840
exceptionalism but this decision this

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.060
thing that they understood and what's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.720
really interesting is like the woman in

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.380
the first two phases that was like

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.600
the other physical people were falling

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.060
apart and she's just like I just love to

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.180
see I just love the work she starts to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.340
fall apart in the third phase

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.100
and this Australian woman who doesn't

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.080
even know how to swim

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.440
literally they brought on board someone

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.539
who didn't know how to swim and never

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.400
been on a boat

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.600
she ends up being complementary

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.740
and saving this woman it's the I it's

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.720
the most brilliant

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.259
uh I don't even I so I come to this

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.300
course tonight I don't think about

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.000
saying this I see Catalia and I'm

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.660
thinking like

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.460
this is the energy

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.360
of new enthusiasm right like like this

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.080
is what we want to bring uh

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.020
to what we're doing in this course and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.880
the rest of us have lots and lots of

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.100
blah blah blah to say about what we've

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.139
been doing the last six months

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.919
but just as an invitation like

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.020
um and when I post this video of

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.080
tonight's course I'll put that video

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.720
link to that video how many of you have

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.400
seen that I think I've linked it maybe a

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.080
couple of times before

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.780
uh it's just it's just an amazing video

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.500
and it's underrepresented because if you

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.139
watch the video it really pays more

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.900
attention to like the extraordinary

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.360
feeds of this and

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.000
but it's just it's this decision they

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.240
made

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.800
you know they put out like

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.600
this social media thing who wants to do

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.020
this and they started in each phase

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.000
uh

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
choosing

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.919
according to different

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.919
parameters or whatever I don't know so

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.620
like I'm projecting that all on on the

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.100
new people here Eric I've seen before

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.000
um Catalina is new but like like I'm

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.580
kind of just telling the people who are

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.039
veterans of the pop-up school not to be

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.440
like veterans but to have this other

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.300
foreign

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.880
maybe someone can help me out here

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.419
and yeah

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.539
and then we'll go on to tonight's uh

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:42.199
topic

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.960
another bedroom

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.400
so

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.699
I just reread uh the beginning of a book

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.160
called The Feminine face of God

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.460
and in the beginning this woman has a

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.960
Jewish woman

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.720
here here's the word Shekinah or

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.240
Shekinah and she doesn't even know what

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.620
it is she's never heard it before but

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.900
she hears it twice and she and she's

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.639
really intrigued it seems to have a lot

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:11.220
of input and so finally she's looking

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.199
looking it up asking her friends or

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.479
family and finally uh so her friend

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:18.180
comes over with um

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.240
something a book about the Kabbalah and

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.800
they look it up and she finds out what

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.599
it means it means the feminine face of

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:25.319
God

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:29.099
and she gets deeply you can tell me if

00:08:29.099 --> 00:08:31.379
I'm wrong I just read it to David she

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:33.479
gets um

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:36.120
well it touched deeply a dream that she

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.479
had and in the dream

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:42.060
I won't go through the whole dream

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.459
but she comes

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:47.100
I guess through a dragon she comes to a

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.080
a place where there's open doors and she

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.779
walks in and she meets uh

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.399
a man

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.260
with a saber

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.080
she gets a saber but he's he lets her

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.440
lead the way and she goes into

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.839
um I can't remember but open some doors

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:06.000
and into the back and Away in the back

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.440
she has this awe because there is the

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.980
Torah and as a child she's never

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.459
was able to see the Torah being female

00:09:17.459 --> 00:09:21.060
and so when she gets up there

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.839
they open it and it's blank there's

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:27.540
nothing on the scroll there's nothing

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.680
there

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.720
and the

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.320
um

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.600
person that she's with

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.920
says um

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.700
puts it

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.120
inside of her body from her head all the

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.980
way down to her knees

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.420
and the message that she gets is that

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.220
um it's hers

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.200
to write

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.519
and

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.220
I can't remember the sequence but as

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.640
soon as she at one as soon as she gets

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.160
that then there are all these men that

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.920
show up and traditional Jewish Garb

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.100
including Moses and King David and King

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.959
Solomon and they're all dancing and

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:11.519
they're all joyful

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:13.880
and she has this feeling of

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.480
indescribable kindness and she asks you

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.120
know something about how am I supposed

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.640
to do this and he says you know just

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.060
talk to your women friends women it's

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.440
women's

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.500
um we our ways don't work anymore

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.680
we don't know the way and it's up to you

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.160
to write the Torah going forward I

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.839
butchered this but that's the basic

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.620
feeling and it

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.600
I just love the um

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.640
it's a similar realization

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.800
our ways don't

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.860
won't get us where we want to go

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.040
so you said

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.560
Indescribable in not able to be

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.560
described

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.320
this is the Torah that is not able to be

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.040
described described

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.579
I just would like to add when Bibi read

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:24.839
me this

00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:27.360
preface to the book

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.600
I felt like

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.540
the story you were telling about the new

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.320
energy coming in is the only way to

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.500
create a novel future

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.660
it's not about

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.880
dissecting

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.540
through reflection the past that's the

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.300
only way to create a new future and the

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.680
and and

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.180
um

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.760
the other thing that struck me really

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:01.860
deeply is that this idea of the Torah

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.339
being inserted into the woman who is

00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:09.440
going to teach the other women

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.860
how to move to this novel future was a

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.360
blank Torah in her body

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.980
through her body to find the way

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.839
so I thought it related to

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:31.079
getting the mind okay

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:34.320
I have not recorded

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.480
I thought you did

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.480
oh I am okay sorry okay

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.560
sorry continue

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.180
so

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:50.519
for her to teach the way for women to

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:52.399
lead the future

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:56.100
is through her getting her mind into her

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:02.279
body and writing the Torah in her body

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.740
I just thought it related to our course

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.399
this year

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.959
thank you David and PBI

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.000
I shared something a while back in

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.380
Collective presidency which I've been

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.680
doing what for three years or so now

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.139
um and part of perspective I have on new

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:24.600
people coming in is there's a there's a

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.940
gravity to the group that is there most

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.220
often and people are not in the group

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.260
are coming from some energetic distance

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.660
and as they get pulled in there's a

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.339
velocity with which they're being pulled

00:13:35.339 --> 00:13:37.740
by this sort of joyful and they're

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.720
radiating that sort of like a comet

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.680
comes close to the Sun there's this

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.880
off-putting of energy that falls into

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:46.680
the space and they're getting high just

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.000
from a velocity with which they're

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.600
moving towards us

00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:59.279
but I also experienced like we have to

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.019
we have to

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:04.680
be aware of the other because like like

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.240
when when a group gets really

00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:13.320
intimate and and Collective on itself

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.540
it's hard for it to like

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.760
have the attraction energy move out

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.120
so this is a problem in a lot of my

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.760
res-based practices is like this group

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.720
got really like

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.420
mind melded and people had their own

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.579
ideas and then new people would come in

00:14:38.579 --> 00:14:39.899
and they're like what the are you

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:41.339
talking about and they felt like really

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:46.380
so like what it is to expand in into

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.600
that so pretty soon we're gonna ask

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.279
Catalia to talk or just like just like

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:55.260
scream or something whatever you want to

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.779
do because we're pretty we're pretty

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:59.639
open to that but

00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:02.459
uh we'll pick on Eric first because he's

00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:05.639
been here twice and second time yeah

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:08.579
yeah we'll see if we you and Eric yeah

00:15:08.579 --> 00:15:11.760
maybe you can paint social dancing off

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.959
of uh sure Catalia yeah do it sure here

00:15:15.959 --> 00:15:17.760
we go

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.940
um

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:23.760
like it's it's a fascinating topic isn't

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.480
it the the I've NFL uh I've been a

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.920
newcomer to a like an established space

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.320
more than once and

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.180
um there are similar feelings that come

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.660
up which is like that like what what the

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.339
hell are you guys talking about what's

00:15:41.339 --> 00:15:43.320
actually the purpose of this that's

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.079
that's that's typically uh at the heart

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:49.199
of of uh how I

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:52.260
um start to engage with what goes on and

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.459
then

00:15:53.459 --> 00:15:56.639
the the I really like the the challenge

00:15:56.639 --> 00:16:00.660
of this this naive energy that's

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.920
required to be kind of nourished or

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.600
allowed uh to spark the Innovation to

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.600
ensure that rigidity is not maintained

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.660
or that Innovation can occur

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.199
um

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:19.260
the challenge I guess in a set space in

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.579
a group with

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.380
um you know in this I want to say an

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.300
established hierarchy I'm not not saying

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.800
that there necessarily is a hierarchy

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.620
here but like they're they're is a set

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.860
kind of there is some sort of order and

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.720
then a newcomer

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.800
coming in with A New Perspective while

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.680
the the group view has been established

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.240
somewhat

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.600
and then allowing space for the the the

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.839
input that that could be coming that

00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:51.120
could be fruitful input or could not be

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:54.420
or could just be naive stupid input

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.199
um and then allowing the evolution of

00:16:58.199 --> 00:16:59.459
things

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:02.220
it's quite a powerful thing uh and I

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.699
think somewhat under utilized typically

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.540
leave it at that

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:16.980
yeah in in in in in conversational space

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.980
I call it naives

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.040
sophisticated naive Observers

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.100
so it's not that like you have no clue

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.100
but

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.400
um

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.240
the the naivete of the observation and

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.059
you're sophisticated is extremely

00:17:39.059 --> 00:17:40.919
important

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:43.860
at a certain phase in development of a

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.400
like a theory or a new model of

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.380
uh the body or something like that and

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.539
um this is something that we have to do

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:58.440
intentionally because as tribal you know

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.020
people sit around a circle and then the

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.039
circle feels really good and like

00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:07.100
um

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.720
that's just we have to understand that

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.720
as a first phase so

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.020
um yeah yeah I I would really like to

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.120
respond one more time if that's okay oh

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.620
yeah

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.799
um

00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:27.600
so as a newcomer my experience is that

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.179
you know you you notice an established

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:33.539
form you notice you you notice you know

00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:36.240
the the energy or the you know the

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.559
approach

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:40.260
and then

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.840
you also know you can also sometimes

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.039
spot the rigidity

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.100
but it's almost I know I wonder if if

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.679
there's something like a bit counter

00:18:52.679 --> 00:18:55.740
intuitive to allowing the because

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.960
there's almost a challenger energy that

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.340
comes with the in

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.020
um in the um pardon with with the

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.880
newcomers View

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.419
that naivete their the

00:19:09.419 --> 00:19:12.120
sorry I'm just uh

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.179
just trying to find the right words

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:18.080
the Navy

00:19:20.039 --> 00:19:22.260
enables a

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.740
so spotting the rigidity understand the

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.320
limitations of the current construct

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.620
the fresh set of eyes enables you to

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.380
maybe get some kind of critical

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.840
um commentary you know to form some

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.440
critical commentary I don't think but

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.660
there's some kind of not wanting to hear

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.340
the critical commentary in the way it's

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.100
intended because there's a stronger

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.220
drive to maintain what is then to evolve

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.080
necessarily because there is all this

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.179
discomfort that is associated with

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:56.700
having to evolve again after

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.940
establishing a certain level of comfort

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.179
Yeah just something I'm wondering about

00:20:03.179 --> 00:20:05.780
I mean

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.140
[Music]

00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:16.400
and in the stowa

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.960
um the way Peter Lindbergh was running

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.480
it is like he just featured a lot of

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.880
different perspectives

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.720
and so a lot of people came from the

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.520
store and I had to say this is not like

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.340
the store like this is my thing like I

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.799
teach my thing my view

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:39.419
uh where are you my blah blah blah but

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.600
over time it's become much more

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.100
co-creative because people will say

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.419
things

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:47.580
and so

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.220
I might put it into words or put it into

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.640
a model but it's definitely something I

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.100
would not have thought of when I did it

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.760
so there is kind of like you know I talk

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.620
about it like

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.820
um new theory of the body okay so when

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.880
your insulin levels

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.700
your sugar levels I guess go too high

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.440
all the cells in your body suffer

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.900
but only your pancreas can do something

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.600
about it right only your paint and so

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.919
it's like

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:26.340
like we were different organs of

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.360
something

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.460
and I have a certain so so

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.880
yeah so there's a strong asymmetry and

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.580
that's okay because like

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.700
like there's a strong asymmetry in your

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.860
pancreas what the pancreas can do for

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.740
your the rest of your body but

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.799
um

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:52.740
that should also and this is what I hear

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.039
you saying that should also be open to

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:58.320
transformation

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.900
yeah it's almost like an ID board sorry

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.820
yeah no

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.280
it's almost like an ID box it's required

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.020
like you know where can you deposit

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.740
these ideas that that for for evolution

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.260
um you know any kind of simplistic way

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.940
of looking at it but

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.159
it is kind of like that how do you how

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:19.799
do you transfer that idea in a

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:22.320
constructive way and how does it get the

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.299
attention it requires to be considered

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:26.880
properly so that Evolution if if it is

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.480
indeed an evolution a positive evolution

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.360
is gonna create it

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.340
exactly and and how

00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:45.539
we want a better world we want better

00:22:45.539 --> 00:22:48.000
futures for our children we want to

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.400
plant that flourish I mean

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.220
it's it's very

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.620
frustrating that there's all these

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.539
common goals common

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.740
and then there's this

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.820
there's something misunderstood between

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.120
having common vision

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.240
and the lack of execution

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.940
and

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.179
um in the middle there's all this

00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:23.760
chaos where it's like yeah yeah but no

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.400
but yes but no but yes because we're

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.720
trying to marry

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.100
the fundamental desire of life

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.799
to to

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:40.020
the outcome

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.299
and in the middle we're confused

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:43.860
basically

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.600
as a species I would say I mean myself

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.380
including

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.640
for me purpose comes up a lot and then

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.360
like you know re get having Clarity of

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.000
purpose and then understanding the scope

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.039
that therefore is yours to play in and

00:24:08.039 --> 00:24:09.600
then you know if you if you get over

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.179
ambitious and there's scope creep uh in

00:24:12.179 --> 00:24:14.640
regard in the alignment with the actual

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.299
purpose that's sometimes where you know

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:20.880
where the sub-optimal stuff starts to

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.500
happen and we're pretending to be

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.900
something we're not or

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.299
yeah interesting uh it's interesting

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:30.679
Dynamics right yeah

00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:40.820
um so Eric got me curious as he was

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.520
describing what a naive Observer coming

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.880
into a group can see and I was just

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.159
wondering if uh Eric you might be

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:53.460
willing to share any of the observation

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.280
that

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:56.940
um

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.679
uh

00:24:58.679 --> 00:25:01.559
yeah that you might have of the girls

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:03.360
sure

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.940
so

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.220
um I just gonna I'm just gonna preface

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.659
it with um saying that uh

00:25:12.659 --> 00:25:16.500
the I've got two key examples that that

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.600
that and in the back of that of

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.500
experienced that uh made me kind of uh

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.020
wonder about this and this this setting

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.880
is not one of the examples that I have

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.700
in here in my in my head around hey this

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.100
is very clearly where where the naive

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.740
new uh or the new person with the naive

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.799
mindset comes in and has a view that

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:40.380
isn't being heard yet or there so this

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.960
is this is my second time here so it's

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.200
too early to have any kind of big ones

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.240
it's it's more like I was in the senior

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.760
leadership team at work where this was

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.559
really clearly kind of observed when I

00:25:52.559 --> 00:25:54.900
was just new coming in and I I spent

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.480
some time with Collective presencing and

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.820
I I you know I felt very strongly there

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.520
that there was this this this situation

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.400
where all the feedback could could have

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.100
been heard and for the evolution of of

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.279
it that you know I didn't feel

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:14.279
um uh uh there was any kind of fertile

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:16.380
ground for or anything or an opportunity

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.779
so

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:21.779
my first impression I I'll share that if

00:26:21.779 --> 00:26:23.700
that's required if that's the request

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.600
Mary uh if if that's appreciated at all

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.500
um

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.240
first impression it's fascinating

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.419
um uh field

00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:39.299
uh really strong

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:42.779
um uh input and

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:45.659
um very skillful

00:26:45.659 --> 00:26:46.700
um

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.799
guiding by Bonita on a uh on a a a

00:26:51.799 --> 00:26:54.539
fascinating topic that's kind of like at

00:26:54.539 --> 00:26:58.799
the edge of things so I think the the

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:01.620
the many the the big kind of continuous

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.140
evolution of the of the

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.120
of the let's call it the literature

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.059
around that that is uh for the pop-up

00:27:09.059 --> 00:27:12.840
school is as phenomenal and a lot of

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.020
hungry nurse around engaging on the

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.380
topic is my first impression

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.400
um

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.100
what I think will what what I'm

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:28.860
interested to learn is where the

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.840
Practical

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.260
um you know so is it is it is it

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.980
philosophy

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:39.000
philosophizing so I think well

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.320
philosophying or is it going to be also

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.000
adding to how I position myself in the

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.580
world and you know how much of it going

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.679
is is it going to be the practical

00:27:52.679 --> 00:27:54.480
application at some point After

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.720
experiencing it for a while or will it

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.520
be more of a

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.299
conceptual theoretical uh experience and

00:28:03.299 --> 00:28:05.880
I have no idea so because I'm this much

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.820
this might like what my my tuna first

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.460
I've spent two and a half hours here so

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.559
I know nothing really

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:15.659
but I'm yeah I'm super intrigued and

00:28:15.659 --> 00:28:18.720
it's fascinating stuff and uh it feels

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.700
really

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.419
it feels like uh they feel uh I feel

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:26.520
there's a whole lot of depth there and a

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.200
lot of quality so yeah I'm super

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.740
intrigued

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.860
okay I have to run for just three

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.039
seconds three minutes but but

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.059
um

00:28:51.059 --> 00:28:57.679
yeah so I I I maybe people can help uh

00:28:57.679 --> 00:29:00.900
make the case for practicality and I

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.179
know you have stories and I'll be right

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:04.200
back

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.380
I'll um I'll share

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.720
um so I'm kind of having the experience

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.419
of I've been away mostly but I haven't

00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:14.159
really been present for like six months

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:16.320
or so kind of other things that I had

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.740
been uh at the top of school since the

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.000
start of it

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.320
um

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.960
and you know it was I'd wanted to be

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.760
here but couldn't for various reasons

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.340
but like also in that I

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.320
recognize that actually there's also

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.960
maybe some some good in that for me in

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.820
the way of like

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.980
it gave me opportunity to

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.080
see all right how am I actually

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.240
practicing this how am I embodying this

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.460
like in relationships with people who

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.960
don't have all this lingo who aren't

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.340
coming to these classes who aren't

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.720
necessarily interested in having these

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.140
conversations uh from uh a point of like

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.360
philosophizing about it but like

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.700
just people in my life

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.000
um who I have just various different

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.840
kinds of relationships with how

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.240
yeah how does this translate

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.299
um and also making sure that I guess

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:14.940
there was a there was also a way of like

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:18.240
making uh just checking myself to be

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.919
like am I just like aping this stuff

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:22.200
because I'm around hearing about it a

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.360
lot and I kind of it can you know you

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.220
can think oh yeah cool yeah I know this

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.679
this stuff conceptually so this is where

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:30.600
I'm at you know

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.740
um

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.559
and serving the time away has given me a

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:37.860
good chance to sort of have that

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.500
reflection space but also yeah the

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.880
practice

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.840
um

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.240
and yeah like I can see there's there's

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.580
loads of the you know terminology and

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.500
things like that that just that goes out

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.700
the window like eventually you know

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.799
isn't the thing that's at the Forefront

00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:56.880
um

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.620
but just little things about just

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.779
learning to to notice more like kind of

00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:02.159
being more in touch with my body and

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:04.559
being able to just even even little

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:07.679
tricks of like uh like kind of hacks of

00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:10.500
being able to kind of move into

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.080
um like Alison Chuck mode more like kind

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.720
of thin kind of egocentric just even

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.340
little things we learned early on we're

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.299
just like

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:20.159
you know focusing your eyes on the

00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:23.039
peripheral and noticing how just

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:26.340
employing those like yeah those things

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.600
like kind of in different situations

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.779
that helped me to navigate and move in

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:32.880
another way

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.840
um

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.460
you know there's there's loads that I

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.159
could go back and I'd love to like I'm

00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:40.860
here for the recap of this last session

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.260
um and now it's this lasts uh six months

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.360
or so

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.260
and

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.559
yeah there's never gonna be the same

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:52.080
just like having that recap or even just

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.820
watching the videos back you know as

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.320
being in the space of people and

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.820
developing those relationships and

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.620
practice

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.399
um

00:31:59.399 --> 00:32:02.279
yeah I've also been on on my other

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:05.460
Journeys and and bringing

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.559
what I've also gathered

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:11.520
there back into this space now

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.640
um

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.919
I'd also say uh

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:22.799
kind of similar I guess but

00:32:22.799 --> 00:32:25.799
I find this a lot of stuff here like

00:32:25.799 --> 00:32:27.659
even though it can get like

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:31.399
theories and stuff theoretical

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.080
I don't know just the way maybe

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.720
she presents it or it's presented and

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.120
just little pieces of advice here and

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:41.279
there it's almost like it doesn't

00:32:41.279 --> 00:32:44.340
like maybe some Frameworks or courses

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.080
and stuff can kind of Silo people into

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.279
different

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:51.179
ways of thinking and it can kind of

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:53.100
make it difficult to talk about with

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.760
other people but I find this stuff

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.620
maybe it's just the ways presented as

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.539
being like don't focus on the theory too

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:03.720
much but it kind of it doesn't do that

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.899
for me anyway like it

00:33:06.899 --> 00:33:09.360
I find I get more engaged with other

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.140
people and the world as opposed to you

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.539
know being a siled sort of yeah

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:18.440
framework

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.960
I think I'd like to share

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.220
um as sort of new to this group

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.559
I've been to I think

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:38.399
um three or four sessions

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:40.380
um

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.960
and I think it's it's interesting to

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.120
hear what you're saying Eric because I

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.039
definitely feel like I'm walking into a

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:50.159
space that's very different

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:50.760
um

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.159
but has a different

00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:56.760
culture horizon line than the one that

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.039
I'm from I come from

00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:01.679
Dance Movement therapy which is a very

00:34:01.679 --> 00:34:03.720
matrilineal

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.899
community and it's very focused on

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:10.440
creative process dance in the body so

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.919
this is the language with which I

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:16.760
have been have been trained

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.919
and the thing that I feel so gratified

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:24.300
by and encouraged by is within this

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.060
space when I

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.720
move into it when I offer something I

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.080
have an experience of it being

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.300
um

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.879
Landing in a different way than it does

00:34:38.879 --> 00:34:42.740
in a lot of the rest of the world

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.300
um

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.639
and so that first of all feels really

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.320
really wonderful

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.099
I'm also very conscious of myself as

00:34:53.099 --> 00:34:56.839
um I think you said maybe disruptor Eric

00:34:56.839 --> 00:34:59.820
like something like David do you

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.380
remember when I came in and I just sang

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.380
to you guys in the small in the small

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.200
group I was ready to bring in something

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.599
that was like what

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:12.480
Let's Dance right it was a dance it was

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.020
a song an invitation to dance and

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.700
um

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.520
and it go it goes like this it's David

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.400
both you probably heard it but it like

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.020
let's dance put on your Red Shoes and

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.020
Dance the Blues

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.839
yeah so it's it's I was trying to see

00:35:33.839 --> 00:35:37.200
like what happens in the body like

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.359
that's I guess the inquiry like what

00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:42.900
happens when you hear a call to dance

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.859
when you hear a song like

00:35:46.859 --> 00:35:49.740
do we move into the the thoughts of the

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.579
song do we do we connect somehow into a

00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:55.859
memory or into you know um build that

00:35:55.859 --> 00:35:58.440
observational piece through an

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.400
instigation or like a provocation that

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.280
hopefully is playful

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.960
um so

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.020
yeah I think that that's that's what I'm

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.020
feeling is just a lot of gratitude to be

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.079
in a space where although the languaging

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:21.660
is different we are we are creating

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.099
uh scaffolding together

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.579
so and I you know I I love the vision to

00:36:32.579 --> 00:36:34.920
to shift something and I wonder like

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.920
there's a lot of something in the world

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.440
and I think when we are called in in a

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.839
way that is

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:47.220
um joyful pleasureful engaging like like

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.720
that's how I want to change the world

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.800
so

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.420
that's awesome for me

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:05.960
I think I would like to share

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.800
um

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.500
I loved the phrase you used Eric

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:20.579
fascinating guiding

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.000
and

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.160
for me the pop-up school has been

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.000
practical

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.520
I've

00:38:37.859 --> 00:38:40.859
digested

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.099
through an open

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.260
consciousness

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.920
ideas that have come from the

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.579
fascinating guiding

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.440
and opened myself up

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.480
to

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.280
be more clear about who I am as I walk

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.859
my walk

00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:15.359
and how is that practical

00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.000
I don't have

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.640
that many

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:26.220
interpretations and judgments about the

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.240
sun shining I'm feeling in my body the

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.560
Sun's shining

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.480
that's really practical

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.160
the day is the day

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.640
so it comes through

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.099
the philosophy

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:52.740
exploration

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:56.700
you know for me to ask myself so what's

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.220
my disposition before I hit my feet on

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.099
the ground in the morning

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:05.640
kind of an interesting question

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.339
in the middle of my lunch to say hey

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:10.320
wait a minute what am I participating

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.680
with

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.440
kind of simple stuff and yet this is the

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.760
way

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.800
that it's practical for me

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.300
there is this whole

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.200
you know peace

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.079
I mean it's a big piece

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:40.579
let me just look around here

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:44.820
oh it's just Marie and Bonita

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:48.180
and maybe one of the horse that inspired

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.780
that picture but we've had a personal

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.260
Direct

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.859
connected

00:40:55.859 --> 00:40:58.260
experience of each other

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.119
we know we were present with each other

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:07.500
so there's this uh camaraderie that's

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.960
very real as well

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.180
and that is practical

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.700
okay having said that is is Kimberly

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.320
still oh yeah

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.920
one thing about what Kimberly shared

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.839
she didn't come into the breakout

00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:27.180
thinking she was going to sing a song I

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.160
mean I'm projecting that or I'm thinking

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.119
that

00:41:30.119 --> 00:41:32.400
it was something that just arose for her

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.800
and she just did it and we just kind of

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.000
flowed with it it was this kind of

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.640
the unfolding

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.940
of the connection and the committed

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.760
listening and being together in that

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.760
that happened so I was glad to have her

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.500
remind me of that

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:57.839
that broke something to mind and I'm

00:41:57.839 --> 00:41:59.220
going to say it's practical research

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.260
practical in my life

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.260
I was Thursday I was flipping through

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:08.160
the Washington Post online and I passed

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.280
something and something in me

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.260
flipped back

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.099
and I saw the word Embry now I'm retired

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:17.760
and

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.920
this guy

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.020
um his wife died and I worked with him

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.940
before I retired

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.940
and the Wake was the next day I said I

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.099
need to be there I know I need to be

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:31.280
there

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.140
so I went

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.420
and I hugged him I told him I was sorry

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.760
I told him I loved loved him and he

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.220
cried and I cried and I spoke to him for

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.900
a while and I left

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.339
but

00:42:44.339 --> 00:42:47.099
what occurs in these spaces in this

00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:50.460
space is it loosens up

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.160
thoughts that I have shells that I

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.040
created of knowing something so that I

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.380
can pick up stuff like that and act on

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.220
it when it's time to

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.780
yeah it resonates just these last few

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:17.579
weeks um I've come to see my uh mum at

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:20.520
Spain and it was

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.920
well I came here to support her through

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.780
her husband passing

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.880
um we got here like five days before and

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.460
I've been out here another like almost

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.980
two weeks since and

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.319
yeah just even in that and just the way

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:35.579
that I'm

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:38.700
just being present with her and even

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.800
just trying to

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.540
um

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.579
yeah it's just I'm you know I'm trying

00:43:44.579 --> 00:43:46.560
to just help her like kind of through

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.859
this moment but also kind of like set

00:43:49.859 --> 00:43:52.140
herself up for like kind of going

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:53.400
forward

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.980
um I just found that so much that

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.119
there's like there's lots of little

00:43:57.119 --> 00:43:58.920
things it's just hard to name

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.680
but just ways that I'm able to kind of

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.560
show up and kind of move energy and like

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.920
kind of really be attentive to like her

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.520
and her energy and also like

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.980
yeah just knowing which bits to kind of

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.079
I don't know sometimes just to

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:17.940
to give some

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.400
support to and like kind of and like how

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.500
to maybe yeah see it see a kind of a

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.819
thought or a line that's kind of maybe

00:44:23.819 --> 00:44:26.400
going somewhere that like uh and just

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.380
like little ways of just

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.520
um

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.920
yeah just I guess just really really

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.300
being present

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.119
um with her and just like

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:38.520
no encounter

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.579
kind of take on like

00:44:44.099 --> 00:44:46.380
I guess like kind of yeah be be with her

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.420
without like kind of taking on things in

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.040
a way that's also like kind of not good

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.079
for me or like kind of just again just

00:44:52.079 --> 00:44:54.420
there's ways of just

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.940
yeah moving energy that I feel like I've

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.819
definitely developed a lot of skill in

00:44:59.819 --> 00:45:02.819
spaces

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.740
moving energy

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.920
on it speaking of having embodied 3D

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.560
memories of people I have that with JJ

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.640
and

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.400
hearing the story about his caretaking

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:23.339
brings up memories of how JJ shows up in

00:45:23.339 --> 00:45:24.900
the world which

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.140
uh it's just yeah

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.180
brings up a lot a lot of very good

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.099
feelings for me um

00:45:32.099 --> 00:45:35.400
and that phrase moving energy

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.000
um

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.460
often yeah the public school is the

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.660
place where I come to have things

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.000
pointed at that like I have a hard time

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.640
seeing I'm like what is I

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.579
I get what are you pointing at uh and

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:52.800
uh but part of what

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.099
I've noticed a lot of arousal energy

00:45:55.099 --> 00:45:58.380
I'll put it that way moment it's like

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.859
damn this is a lot as I'm sitting here

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:04.980
but part of and that's an image having

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.900
something pointed at that I can't see

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.780
trying to like bring that image back

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.359
into my body and be with this arousal

00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:15.240
energy in a different way that I am

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.700
being challenged or provoked into

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.760
holding uh in new ways and I still don't

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.560
still

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:24.960
still trying to figure that one out and

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.839
then even in real time right now right

00:46:27.839 --> 00:46:30.300
here and I suspect it has something to

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.920
do with what Bonnie wrote down I want

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.200
the words to come out of my mouth the

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.819
way the dance comes out of my body

00:46:35.819 --> 00:46:40.380
entirely free of my mind so that's a big

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:43.260
yeah yeah

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.720
how to how to let this

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.220
what's right here uh

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.319
blow out to everything that's out there

00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:55.560
in new ways uh potentially

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.420
still squinting though

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.480
yeah

00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:06.660
okay I'll have to tell a story

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.599
are we ready for a story like that has

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:11.940
nothing to do with this but

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.319
has something to do with this

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.480
uh so you know I

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.599
just spent 30 years trying to figure out

00:47:21.599 --> 00:47:26.579
horses and what a horse is and I had

00:47:26.579 --> 00:47:27.900
this

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.180
I still have her she's quite old now

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.119
this horse that I was doing 100 mile

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:35.700
endurance races with

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:39.060
and the problem was she was too

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.680
competitive like

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.500
I had to start two hours after everybody

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.400
else started because if she saw like

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.060
horses in front of her she just got like

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.060
way too competitive and I'm like

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.560
yeah but

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.020
we gotta go 100 miles you can't like

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.339
expend your whole energy

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.319
you know like so endurance writing you

00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:06.359
have to be very patient and understand

00:48:06.359 --> 00:48:10.560
the long Arc and I happen to have bought

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.040
a horse that was very uh short-term racy

00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.780
so

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:20.160
I started working with this horse Guru

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.280
um

00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:25.619
I don't know how much you want to know

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:27.359
about her but she's

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:32.160
she was lived in a very rural area and

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.180
her father made these living by training

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:37.680
ponies

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:40.440
but he had his young children train

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.960
ponies because they weren't

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.079
big enough to push them around so they

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:49.560
had to actually use clever ways to train

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.760
ponies

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.920
and this is how this woman got to be

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.900
uh so clever about

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.300
horses because she trained them since

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.220
she was like four or five years old

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.359
didn't go to school

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.680
and

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.540
um because if you're that little and you

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.760
have a pony and you can't push it around

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.079
you have to figure out how to

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:15.000
communicate with it

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.460
so

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:19.640
um

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.460
now I have I got lost in my story and I

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:28.200
tried to figure out how I'm gonna get it

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.380
I wanted to bridge this with Sam but the

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.020
whole point is it's like

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.140
um

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.579
what were you saying Sam okay I have to

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:44.540
bring myself out of the story and two

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.099
uh reality here

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:49.980
and that is

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.160
um

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:04.500
so the whole journey was like I made it

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.339
too complex

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.380
like I I confronted the horse and I was

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:12.300
like why isn't she like me what isn't

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.180
she care about me what you know the

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:18.119
whole situation was too complex and my

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:21.060
point here which I'm trying to make is

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:25.040
that I have nothing to teach

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:28.740
all I'm trying to do like I have this

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.740
this this thing I say all the time you

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.020
know you see these videos of cows

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.319
getting on grass for the first time and

00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:38.880
they think it's an extraordinary

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.780
experience because literally what

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.420
they're feeling is like this amazing

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.339
State experience

00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:50.760
but cows and grass

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.700
it's just natural right but if you've

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.760
been deprived of that when you get put

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.819
in this experience you're like

00:50:58.819 --> 00:51:02.099
whoa like this is like some high State

00:51:02.099 --> 00:51:03.480
experience

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.180
and all I'm trying to do in the office

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.540
go is put the cows

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.640
on the grass

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.220
everything else is the complexity of

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.099
language and all this stuff

00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:20.339
once I started to realize like

00:51:20.339 --> 00:51:22.980
what is a horse

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.680
they're not that they're they're complex

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.540
in the sense that they're complexly

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.740
embedded in nature and stuff like that

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.160
but they're the complexity is elegant

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.240
that as on Old Nas would say

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.819
we want to understand elegant complexity

00:51:43.819 --> 00:51:46.800
which is life-bearing or life-giving

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.140
those words sometimes are too

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.920
what is elegant complexity you know like

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.579
so

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:01.559
and I'll tell one other story so because

00:52:01.559 --> 00:52:03.839
I didn't get from here to there

00:52:03.839 --> 00:52:05.220
uh

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:06.559
quickly

00:52:06.559 --> 00:52:10.079
and with my horse Guru

00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:11.460
oh

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.460
who ate squirrels when she was kids when

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:16.559
I talked about

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:17.339
um

00:52:17.339 --> 00:52:19.700
she also was third in the world

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.500
championships five times and you know

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:24.920
like

00:52:25.319 --> 00:52:28.440
but one time she's like she took me to

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.920
this

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.720
workshop with horses

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.319
I took my my mare this

00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:40.819
hyper uh competitive mayor

00:52:40.819 --> 00:52:42.310
and

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:42.780
[Music]

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:43.740
um

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.559
we were in this really really she was

00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:48.540
not a fancy she didn't have fancy

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.880
facilities I don't have fancy facilities

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.839
but

00:52:51.839 --> 00:52:55.140
we were asked to demo in this really

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.380
fancy facility and we were in this huge

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:02.119
Arena and there was like there's glass

00:53:02.119 --> 00:53:04.680
Amphitheater where like these rich

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.079
people were looking at us working with

00:53:07.079 --> 00:53:09.619
my horse

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.700
and

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:16.319
that was really weird to me and

00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:18.780
my horse and so I'm trying to do these

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:20.880
things that she taught me my horses all

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.440
over the place

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.020
but it's really like my horse she's

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.819
she's jumping she's wearing shoes

00:53:29.819 --> 00:53:31.200
like

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.960
a lot of Chaos

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.780
and my horse Guru comes over to me and

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.040
she says

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.119
um

00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:42.180
Margaret Beeman she says like you gotta

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.520
slow yourself down

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.099
and so then I try to slow myself down

00:53:47.099 --> 00:53:49.800
and it's still not working and then

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.300
she's like no slow yourself down and she

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.380
took my hands

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.900
and she pushed me on the ground like

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.160
that and she walked me like this one

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.559
two three

00:54:07.559 --> 00:54:10.859
four and I'm like no I'm quit

00:54:10.859 --> 00:54:13.260
people are watching

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.000
and she's

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.220
stuck her finger up her nose and said

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:19.859
well what are you worried about whether

00:54:19.859 --> 00:54:21.780
you can control your horse or the

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:24.599
 people are watching

00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:29.119
I mean literally she did that

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:32.760
this was a reflection of how up I

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.000
was

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.839
literally

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.579
it's not complex you see what I'm saying

00:54:44.579 --> 00:54:48.900
it's not complex it's not rocket

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.319
science

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:56.660
it is laws that we understand

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.800
intuitively as people and we neglect

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.180
you see what I'm saying

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.319
you see what I'm saying this is what we

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:13.380
have to teach

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.800
the rest is like the complexity of

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.540
getting from here to there getting

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.359
someone who's got like all these ideas

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:23.400
and this and that

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:28.680
getting the rest is just uh

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.940
getting from here to there

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:36.559
yeah so what do you think about that

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:50.640
what do you think about that I

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.839
I had like I had goosebumps running

00:55:54.839 --> 00:55:56.640
um on my back

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.339
um and I feel it in my face I had tears

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:01.079
coming to my eyes when you said about

00:56:01.079 --> 00:56:04.140
the cows being on the grass that's what

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.760
you're trying to do here

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.099
I'm in awe that's what I think about

00:56:08.099 --> 00:56:10.400
that

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.640
and I want to say for those who are

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.500
listening if they watch this recording

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.859
we're not talking about humans getting

00:56:34.859 --> 00:56:36.540
on the grass

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.540
in a physical sense because humans want

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.700
to get on to language humans want to get

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:46.680
on Concepts it's not we're not trying to

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:49.380
negate

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:52.980
the other expressions of Being Human

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.859
but we want us to really really

00:56:55.859 --> 00:56:59.099
understand what is the grass

00:56:59.099 --> 00:57:01.680
for humans

00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.319
versus the machine

00:57:04.319 --> 00:57:05.880
right

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:11.099
so one we're not saying grass like okay

00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:13.440
so you become a vegan

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.420
we're not reductionists like that but

00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.880
what is

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.240
grass for human versus maybe the machine

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.240
whatever

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.359
yeah and I know that's not what you're

00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:30.480
saying Eric but I just wanted to

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.180
uh make sure people understood that

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.660
all right so I have something unrelated

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.920
to say

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.119
or maybe related

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:51.480
okay I want to say it's never unrelated

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.619
when you speak

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:00.800
um now I forgot what it was

00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:05.819
so

00:58:05.819 --> 00:58:09.140
a friend of mine says

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.599
okay so Charles eisenstein says

00:58:12.599 --> 00:58:15.720
that uh I'm totally into

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.540
um the leadership possible leadership of

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:22.319
uh Robert Kennedy I'm very excited I'm

00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:25.800
very deeply moved and excited and but

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.359
the thing is what Charles eisenstein

00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:28.980
says is that

00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:31.700
uh

00:58:31.819 --> 00:58:36.119
he can't change anything

00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:40.020
without us like he can't anyone any

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:42.240
leader quote-unquote leader cannot speak

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.599
something new into a field if the field

00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:50.160
isn't eating it you know hungry for it

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.799
so there's nothing that can change in

00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:54.540
our world and whether or not you like

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:57.660
RFK there's nothing that can change

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:02.339
unless we are an embodiment of the

00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:05.640
change that we want to see catalyze

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.020
somewhere

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:10.880
and my friend says

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:15.000
you know we have to become

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.720
we have to come into our own

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.460
purest

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.020
finest

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.020
vibration ourselves

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:30.020
and that we have we um

00:59:30.359 --> 00:59:34.400
and maybe that's like eating the grass

00:59:35.339 --> 00:59:38.400
and meanwhile

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.740
I was watching a congressional hearing

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:44.460
and there was a a Democrat a couple

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.859
Democrats who got me so

00:59:46.859 --> 00:59:49.020
pissed off

00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:52.380
I became so hateful

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.619
listening to what I thought was hateful

00:59:55.619 --> 00:59:58.619
so here we have this hateful hateful

00:59:58.619 --> 01:00:01.740
that's the world we live in polarity

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.200
reactivity

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:04.859
um

01:00:04.859 --> 01:00:07.319
and

01:00:07.319 --> 01:00:10.680
and meanwhile in this particular the

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:14.240
censorship thing I was watching

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.819
he had some stuff leveled at him that

01:00:17.819 --> 01:00:20.400
was hateful that was trying to censor

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.920
him in the censorship thing and what I

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.220
watched him do was

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:28.079
well the first thing he did addressing

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:31.260
this woman was refer to something that

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:32.339
she said

01:00:32.339 --> 01:00:34.559
that moved him

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:38.520
that touched him and lift up

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:41.520
the the the beauty in her own life

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.119
purpose so I saw him go from this

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.579
hateful hateful

01:00:46.579 --> 01:00:48.359
to

01:00:48.359 --> 01:00:50.420
um

01:00:55.079 --> 01:00:57.240
curving space

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.720
by being more

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.700
um

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.059
really who he is and by lots of things

01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:08.760
taking ownership all sorts of things but

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.380
so the challenge is

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:21.200
to go so far beyond

01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:25.400
how we know how to be with each other

01:01:25.559 --> 01:01:30.599
and also to take responsibility for

01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:33.540
every time

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.780
I see something out there

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.559
that uh gets me angry

01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:43.380
that I don't like

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.960
um that I contract around

01:01:48.059 --> 01:01:51.920
and now how can I be

01:01:53.339 --> 01:01:55.680
somebody new

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.819
in that context

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.160
so that that person

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:05.040
has something new available

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.960
there's new energy

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.720
and it's like the idea of Mana

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.299
you can't carry it with you

01:02:12.299 --> 01:02:16.079
it's always something

01:02:16.079 --> 01:02:17.400
uh

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.799
that's available if we're available

01:02:24.059 --> 01:02:27.319
so that's what I'm working with

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.700
so one thing we might

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.160
um do

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.160
or not it's completely up to

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:24.260
what we feel here is to

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:32.099
integrate this with

01:03:32.099 --> 01:03:34.819
like

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:38.099
we've been working on this new theory of

01:03:38.099 --> 01:03:41.220
the body like like

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:43.339
um

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.460
how does this um

01:04:07.579 --> 01:04:10.799
redefine what a body is

01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:12.599
or

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:15.799
um integrate with

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.319
um

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:24.540
I got Justin wrote a comment

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.359
today that takes a little further or it

01:04:27.359 --> 01:04:30.180
takes it takes this this course

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.339
trajectory

01:04:32.339 --> 01:04:34.440
because we've been working a lot with

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:38.660
putting their mind back into the body

01:04:38.819 --> 01:04:42.780
um and Justin wrote a comment today I

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:48.720
can't remember what and what thread but

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.099
um

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:53.160
which we're going to return to in the

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.260
fall and that is like and then put the

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.920
body back into nature right

01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.579
um

01:04:59.579 --> 01:05:01.920
so maybe we could think about the

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.140
trajectory

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.140
um

01:05:08.819 --> 01:05:11.780
just a thought

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.280
um my thoughts with that is that

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:26.339
the mind never really left the body

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:29.700
the body really never left nature

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.579
however there's many models or ways of

01:05:32.579 --> 01:05:34.319
thinking frames of viewing the world

01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:36.720
which locate the Mind somewhere outside

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.119
of the body locate the individual or the

01:05:39.119 --> 01:05:41.640
self somewhere outside of nature

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.540
um

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:44.460
so it's really nice to have models and

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.040
Frames to help us see the models and

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.420
frames that kind of

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.760
separate mind from body and body from

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.020
nature

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.280
um

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.380
and can kind of

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:58.400
break that spell

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.839
that's one of the things I've been

01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:06.180
really benefiting from in this course uh

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.059
just having

01:06:09.059 --> 01:06:13.140
some tools to look at what frames

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.660
are kind of presupposing mind outside of

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.940
body presupposing body outside of Nature

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.880
and um

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.799
seeing that Napier it's actually a lot

01:06:22.799 --> 01:06:25.079
simpler than that maybe I don't need to

01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:27.960
do Parts work and maybe

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.020
um

01:06:33.539 --> 01:06:34.859
yeah

01:06:34.859 --> 01:06:36.420
Parts work is the thing that's come into

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.339
mind right now but there's there's so

01:06:38.339 --> 01:06:40.200
many therapeutic modalities leadership

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.880
modalities

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.599
um

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.660
community building modalities that

01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.299
actually presuppose a separation deep

01:06:48.299 --> 01:06:51.059
down at the core

01:06:51.059 --> 01:06:54.980
and they've they don't feel right

01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:59.640
so

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.700
yeah I'm interested in um

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.180
how to act from a place that is

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.619
where we don't even have to talk of

01:07:07.619 --> 01:07:09.960
about mind back and body body back in

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.480
nature just like that's the way it is we

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.280
all agree let's let's act from there

01:07:22.619 --> 01:07:25.859
yeah to uh

01:07:25.859 --> 01:07:27.660
say something along those lines I kind

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.039
of come at it from a little bit of a

01:07:29.039 --> 01:07:31.039
different angle because I

01:07:31.039 --> 01:07:33.539
feel like I've put my body back into

01:07:33.539 --> 01:07:36.299
nature first like and it's just been

01:07:36.299 --> 01:07:38.160
really interesting

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.000
um

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
because the body knows the body knows

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.299
how to be like in nature it's it's I've

01:07:45.299 --> 01:07:47.520
just been noticing as I've been out in

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.160
this pretty open

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.920
landscape that I lived on

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.420
um I haven't had to have much

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.880
instruction my body has just kind of

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.240
known how to move and

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.339
um it's really

01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:04.980
changed my thinking and

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.680
um but yeah I think it's going back to

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.020
that thing of simplifying it's not

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.880
nearly as complicated as we make it and

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.520
if we can get our body back into nature

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:18.060
more freely readily easily our body will

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.500
just know our body just kind of knows

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.819
what to do at least that's how I've

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:22.920
experienced

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.199
my my participation in that

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.600
yeah I realized when are you speaking

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.420
Eric for the first time it occurred to

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.520
me oh I've been here for a little while

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.660
now

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.020
and I thought oh that's interesting and

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.380
then what arose or what I was aware of

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.359
is that

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:56.640
and and this has occurred to me a few

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.980
times just recently

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.640
that what is happening for me here

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.679
there's a lot of things happening but

01:09:04.679 --> 01:09:07.920
what is initially happening always

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.199
is that

01:09:10.199 --> 01:09:14.400
there is an invitation to come and see

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.000
and I love that and I can see it's

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.779
beautifully like I know I hear what

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:23.759
you've been saying about

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.679
where you see

01:09:25.679 --> 01:09:28.140
yourself Benita

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:32.400
um but I I see a beautiful that's an

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.819
elegant structure it's beautiful how the

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:38.160
invitation is given and how it's put

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:42.600
together and how I can enter and be in

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.100
that space and it's not even a space

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.440
um it's to be with what's real

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.719
and it's really simple

01:09:51.719 --> 01:09:55.380
and I really love that and I would just

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:58.380
share one experience which I can only

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.620
use metaphors but it's real because I

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.960
don't I can't quite get the words we did

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.360
the session on awareness

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:09.719
I I came to the second session and all I

01:10:09.719 --> 01:10:11.820
kept doing was smiling

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:14.460
and I'm still smiling I'm always smiling

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.120
I go places and nothing's changed really

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.699
like there's a sense in which nothing at

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:22.800
all has changed my life just people are

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.960
like they are and situations are like

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.659
they are but everything has changed and

01:10:27.659 --> 01:10:29.580
I just smile

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:34.020
and how it is for me and partly your

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.860
Holly I can't quite

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:42.420
see or be we same as you but it's like

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.460
what happened was after that session

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.800
it's like there was a knock on the door

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.060
right

01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.900
and I just opened the door and it's like

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.780
the whole world says well where have you

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.380
been like

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:00.420
we're here haven't you don't you

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:02.219
remember all those little and I do I

01:11:02.219 --> 01:11:05.280
remember all those not all of them but I

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.179
remember lots of incidents where yeah

01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:11.820
I didn't know the world was here I did

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:15.239
feel that but now it's like

01:11:15.239 --> 01:11:18.780
yeah I get the grass

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.199
I think it's a very very beautiful

01:11:22.199 --> 01:11:24.000
um and I have quite a lot of energy

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.860
around

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:26.580
um

01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.560
a lot of stuff that's been said like a

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.960
lot of sparkings going on

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.360
um and I would like to respond to shreky

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.179
now or srina if I may

01:11:36.179 --> 01:11:37.080
um

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.780
as as the

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.719
the feminine Divine I just would like to

01:11:42.719 --> 01:11:45.719
say that the presentation of that in the

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:50.460
1300s was was not about a separation

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.820
there was no separation offered in in

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.239
the Zohar in the Kabbalah about

01:11:57.239 --> 01:11:59.640
the masculine and feminine it was like

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.840
oh no it's about a union about you don't

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.360
have the separation at all It's Tricky

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.800
now

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.080
um you might call it presents

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:15.239
and I really I hear all this talk here a

01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:20.280
lot today about something new but what I

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.040
really love about the Zohar is it's

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.719
ancient anew

01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:27.900
it's it's it's you you you're just not

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:29.760
doing the separation game

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.040
I really love that

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.699
um and that feels also real to me

01:12:35.699 --> 01:12:37.920
um you know I'm not separating the

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:41.880
separating

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.500
yeah I don't know if any of that makes

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:46.080
any sense but it's been

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.179
I really love being here and you people

01:12:48.179 --> 01:12:50.219
are absolutely amazing and thank you

01:12:50.219 --> 01:12:53.420
very much they're very cool

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.260
okay so we know at some point we're

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.920
gonna call on Catalia

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.420
but not right now maybe

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.659
um but I feel the energy there and uh

01:13:30.659 --> 01:13:33.060
David who has extraordinary

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.120
interpersonal

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.199
intuition uh maybe the person

01:13:39.199 --> 01:13:44.000
who can open that portal

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.120
I'd rather just quote a friend of mine

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.040
stand up and say something anything

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:01.940
Catalia

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.300
hello

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.460
um so happy to be here I've been

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:09.780
watching you guys like I've been

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.760
watching videos for like months and

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.620
months now so it's actually really

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.840
surreal to be like actually in it I keep

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:17.640
forgetting that I'm actually in the

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:19.500
video call now

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.900
um right now I'm actually terrified like

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:26.219
we're like nervous and like shaking

01:14:26.219 --> 01:14:28.679
um but like kind of chill as well but

01:14:28.679 --> 01:14:30.840
just talking about

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.219
I don't know I find my words um

01:14:35.219 --> 01:14:38.000
I like it's

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.239
like undeniable to me that like I'm very

01:14:42.239 --> 01:14:45.600
trapped in the mind or I have been and

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:50.100
you know like would like I don't know

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:54.080
for me it's like um all the

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.760
all the beautiful things like in nature

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.040
I'm like downfall like I can be in my

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.280
body for that but like I think when you

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.840
realize that you're really mind trapped

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.000
you've been mind trapped and you know

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.320
your senses are really dull

01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:10.380
um

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.060
you're kind of like in a little bit of

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.159
danger I don't know like you know what I

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:15.780
mean like I'm like I'm down for like the

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.520
good stuff like you know we talk about

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.520
like you know being in a I wanna I Wanna

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.900
Dance

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.840
as well but like you know

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.400
it's a lot of

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.480
I don't know do you know

01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:32.340
it's like a lot of the

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.080
a lot of the dancing is also like scary

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.880
 as well like and you know not

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.980
necessarily stuff I want to do but it's

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.719
also like

01:15:39.719 --> 01:15:41.940
a part of it like yeah I don't know

01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.699
that's all I have to say I'm like

01:15:44.699 --> 01:15:47.760
I want to do this like I I'm like

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.159
but I'm also so scared as well like I'm

01:15:50.159 --> 01:15:53.040
I'm down for the stuff I like but I'm

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.860
scared of the stuff I don't like

01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:00.540
you know but yeah so this is a beautiful

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.420
invitation

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.199
to

01:16:04.199 --> 01:16:05.940
um bring forth

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.080
um

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.540
some voices that are in the same

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:10.739
position

01:16:10.739 --> 01:16:13.980
so what is the pull of the Mind why does

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.260
the mind

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:18.060
the mind

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.640
uh have this

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:26.040
power to pull us out of Nature and dance

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.020
does this resonate with what you're

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.020
saying like like there's this there's

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.780
this feeling that nature and dance is my

01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:37.020
home but what is this other thing that

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.440
what is this other Paul

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:45.060
so I'm thinking Matt and JJ and Sam

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.480
um maybe Aaron

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.760
um Kimberly maybe

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.020
um

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.500
or anyone

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.659
what is that struggle

01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:00.420
what is that struggle

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:01.739
yeah

01:17:01.739 --> 01:17:04.620
tell us out

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:09.239
um I mean for me this struggle is really

01:17:09.239 --> 01:17:13.080
it has to do with death disease decay

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.120
pain

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.040
down to be in my body but my body's

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.260
gonna rot it's going to die It suffers

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.060
it breaks

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.620
um

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:25.500
so there's this pull to kind of get away

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.480
to find something transcended to find

01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.860
something that is um

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:35.840
not as ephemeral or fragile

01:17:37.739 --> 01:17:40.679
susceptible to

01:17:40.679 --> 01:17:44.659
getting just hurt

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.719
yeah I resonate with that

01:17:51.719 --> 01:17:55.380
um I I think there's a tremendous amount

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:59.000
of courage and vulnerability involved in

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.640
connecting with the place that is

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.140
me

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:06.360
um and specifically in dance I'm not

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:08.159
sure

01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:09.239
um

01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:12.960
Catalia what kind of dance you are

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.360
curious about but

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.219
um

01:18:17.219 --> 01:18:19.440
takes courage to enter into a dance

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.540
space and be improvisational for some

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.880
people and to try something entirely new

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.640
or allow their body to lead them into

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.040
movement and to listen to that and

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:29.940
follow

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.760
for for other people it would take a

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.340
tremendous amount of courage to dance

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:38.340
with another person

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.699
and listen to another's body

01:18:41.699 --> 01:18:44.940
As you move

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:46.860
um and so

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.659
I think

01:18:48.659 --> 01:18:50.760
I think in terms of the question of like

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.980
what the Mind gives us I think it gives

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:55.580
us that separation from that

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.560
vulnerability of being in touch with

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.400
what is as it arises

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.420
um and so I I totally relate to

01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:09.300
um what you're saying and and

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:10.860
um

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.920
and hear it so often in the work that I

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.040
do

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.880
yeah like um I want more novelty and

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.800
more surprise like

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.719
but then sometimes when I think about it

01:19:24.719 --> 01:19:27.780
I'm like oh but that I'm also like

01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.179
really scared of what I don't know and I

01:19:30.179 --> 01:19:32.100
think that's why I'm very like in my

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.880
head but not 100 not completely like but

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.480
that's a that's big like and that's

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.820
where the courage has to come in and

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.860
that needs to be yeah

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.620
um

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.739
uh like yeah the yeah worked on or

01:19:49.739 --> 01:19:51.420
that's where the practice is coming like

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.260
that I get I guess

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.179
I'm gonna take a shot at this

01:19:57.179 --> 01:19:58.620
um

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:01.440
it seems to me that part of what the

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.440
Mind does when it's making declarations

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.480
and trying to create something in the

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.020
world is trying to fix Motion in place

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:12.179
which isn't isn't easy to do but when

01:20:12.179 --> 01:20:13.920
you're trying to create something that's

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.900
what you're doing and if you want to

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:16.800
really

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.719
so if you want to be a lawyer you got to

01:20:18.719 --> 01:20:20.699
stay focused for a long time right and

01:20:20.699 --> 01:20:21.900
there's a certain amount of energy that

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:26.040
gets bound up in that but it feels

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.040
confining too it is creative but the

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.659
narrowness of it means you're ignoring

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.640
everything around you so

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.360
I think oftentimes in my own experience

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.940
I'll go oh my God that was stupid and

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.620
the mind goes okay I got it you're

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:42.659
stupid it just does what I tell them to

01:20:42.659 --> 01:20:45.000
do and it holds it tends to hold those

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.739
things in place and the more I repeat

01:20:46.739 --> 01:20:50.400
them the more solid like they become

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.280
so part of what my product my 50 years

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.500
of yoga is to let go

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.920
as porous as I can be and I think

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.040
this is my belief now is that there has

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.560
to be a free-flowing oscillation between

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.440
focused attention and letting go and

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.480
making declarations to try to fix

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:11.159
something in place and letting go

01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:12.960
because I do need some stability in my

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.580
life I don't want to be free-floating

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.199
completely

01:21:16.199 --> 01:21:18.840
but when I'm focused on something it's

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.760
hard to let go when I'm free-floating

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.820
it's hard to get back active so I had to

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.440
allow the space

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.500
to do both and notice when it's time to

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.860
let go

01:21:33.179 --> 01:21:36.600
what comes up for me is uh I think about

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.840
the mind's capacity to simulate and I

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.460
kind of this you know Aaron was saying

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.340
like guys this fear of death or you know

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.560
it can be all kinds of fears that you're

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.140
trying to like get ahead of to like

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.900
figure out like yeah not just to fear

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:53.880
like kind of

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.820
this thing is like you you're diverging

01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:59.100
from your embodied reality to simulate

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.739
something so that you can like figure

01:22:01.739 --> 01:22:03.540
out maybe ahead of time with these kind

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.620
of things but then it's like when you

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:07.320
start or when you we've grown up in a

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.540
culture where we're living more in that

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:12.000
simulated capacity than in our embodying

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.219
capacity I think that's where a lot of

01:22:14.219 --> 01:22:15.060
us

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:16.860
um write for myself that's where I kind

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.620
of I came into this from

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:21.960
and so it's kind of being okay that's a

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.940
great capacity to have

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.100
but like putting in its right place

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.739
putting that mind back in the body and

01:22:28.739 --> 01:22:30.780
that kind of that sort the practice

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.600
really has been for me

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.980
that continues to be

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:39.179
I'm thinking of the origins of the self

01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:41.159
it might be an overload for you the

01:22:41.159 --> 01:22:43.679
delay so much information coming at you

01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:47.659
how are you going just checking in

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.940
um I'm thinking of one of the videos I

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:53.400
watched twice recently that Bonnie had

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.320
about the model the origins of the self

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.940
I got it here actually

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.580
and what comes up or what came up when

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.460
you were speaking is about almost like

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:09.840
the shift

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:12.060
that I've experienced I feel a couple

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.540
years ago from going from me into I

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.600
and then moving away from culture or you

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.420
have to move away from the kind of mind

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.940
that we have

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:27.179
to this almost narcissistic way of being

01:23:27.179 --> 01:23:30.179
that's being forced or pushed back by

01:23:30.179 --> 01:23:32.580
culture itself so it's a very very

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:35.760
vulnerable place I feel to be in and to

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.100
and to actually step into that place of

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:42.300
The Sovereign or like an eye a self and

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.520
and they show up with other eyes so it's

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:48.060
like a a real we that emerges from that

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.880
sovereignty of eye places

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:53.580
and that was one of the biggest shifts I

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.159
I made and this model of the origins of

01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:59.400
the cells really starts to yeah give

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.500
that depth to the void or to the

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:04.199
universe of the things that I I feel I

01:24:04.199 --> 01:24:06.840
have a responsibility to reclaim like

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.380
you know and like animal nature and the

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.199
biotics and elements and and everything

01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:17.400
that I've forgotten that is already here

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.580
and I really feel almost like a flip

01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.980
that the unconscious becomes even more

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:25.560
conscious than the conscious

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.840
that's a that's that's hilarious

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.780
actually it's like hilarious to be

01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:33.120
to have that capacity and that that has

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.179
been taken away from me by

01:24:36.179 --> 01:24:38.100
by Society

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:40.739
and yeah I'm very

01:24:40.739 --> 01:24:43.980
very grateful that I can see again with

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.480
us here

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.340
so yeah that's me

01:24:50.699 --> 01:24:52.860
yeah I I don't know where this comes

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.719
from but there's

01:24:54.719 --> 01:24:56.880
there's like something about like want

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.120
trying to make it less intense by

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:02.400
bonsaiing everything into friendlier

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.100
shapes then they might just naturally

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:09.480
want to take uh and making things less

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.380
weird because in the mind things can

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.260
make sense in a meta stable kind of way

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.860
but if we let go of that then order is

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.719
something that we it's it's almost like

01:25:21.719 --> 01:25:24.480
uh the metaphysical version of Aaron's

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.699
Decay it's like

01:25:26.699 --> 01:25:29.699
order something we just achieve over and

01:25:29.699 --> 01:25:32.780
over and over again together and we're

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:36.120
constantly letting it go and re-reach

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.520
achieving it and it's just weird

01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:41.040
it's just weird

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.020
so yeah I don't know that's that's

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.340
what's coming through right now

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.560
yeah I have this like little theory that

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.320
like our our mind is kind of in this

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.360
process actually of initiation

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.400
where it's like severed and gone away

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.460
from like the home and it's and it's

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.440
like has all this like really naive

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.179
energy you know

01:26:12.179 --> 01:26:14.400
um it's this adolescent that that um

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.800
things that knows everything and

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:19.320
um kind of can tantrum really easily and

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.300
and really lacks maturity

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:24.719
and um my sense is hopefully we're in a

01:26:24.719 --> 01:26:27.300
phase where it's getting initiated and

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.699
it's remembering to come back home and

01:26:29.699 --> 01:26:30.840
hopefully

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.300
now more eventually hopefully more

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.239
mature in knowing what it's capable of

01:26:36.239 --> 01:26:39.900
but also as as a contributor to the

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.420
bigger whole of our body and of nature

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.940
so I feel like we're just at a very

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.340
adolescent stage in our culture and

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.699
Society

01:26:52.199 --> 01:26:54.179
one thing that just came to me when

01:26:54.179 --> 01:26:57.500
Holly was talking is that

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:01.560
all my mechanisms they fixed places

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.260
where I am I put them in place

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.480
I did it nobody else did you know

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.280
culture gave me a certain container that

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.320
I had to you know play around within and

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.020
be influenced by my parents obviously

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:16.100
but um

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:20.639
stepping back and seeing oh I did that

01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:23.580
it's like literally it's not a joke take

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.860
responsibility for the choices that I

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:29.100
made even if I adopted someone else's

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:32.580
and to let go of the energy that I use

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.500
to put it in Plants doesn't mean it's

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:36.480
going to disappear immediately but at

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.199
least if I see it I am seeing it I no

01:27:40.199 --> 01:27:42.239
longer am it and there's a sense of

01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:44.639
freedom in that

01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:48.780
so this is a big insight

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.400
um

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.500
and

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.280
um

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:57.620
yeah so there is a there is this

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.260
constant inundation of cultural

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:04.040
conditioning

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:08.179
and then there's this little

01:28:09.179 --> 01:28:13.440
just little wobbly thing in you that

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.760
is suspect

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.900
do you know what I'm saying like like

01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.540
when you're a child like okay this stuff

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:24.420
is like your parents say this

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:27.300
okay we're gonna have a raise hand raise

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.639
here your parents are telling you this

01:28:29.639 --> 01:28:31.380
you're telling you that this is how it

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:32.520
is

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.100
who remembers the little thing that is

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.520
skeptical

01:28:40.139 --> 01:28:43.139
okay Sam come on raise your hands I'm

01:28:43.139 --> 01:28:46.920
looking for right hand raised like

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.040
so that little that little

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:52.860
Plum Bob

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.159
is attached to

01:28:55.159 --> 01:28:58.880
the natural law

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:03.179
and so that's what you're you're saying

01:29:03.179 --> 01:29:06.620
Justin like like

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.620
there's like it's like you're the well

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.600
we don't have okay there's like a little

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.199
thing

01:29:15.739 --> 01:29:17.760
all right

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.719
and and

01:29:22.199 --> 01:29:24.000
it's not it doesn't have to be

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.159
revolutionary it doesn't have to be like

01:29:26.159 --> 01:29:29.219
radically uh

01:29:29.219 --> 01:29:31.560
but there's something there paying off

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.239
of me I forgot what I was talking about

01:29:33.239 --> 01:29:35.540
here

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:41.000
kind of reminds me of like

01:29:41.159 --> 01:29:42.780
kind of bring it back to like what

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.580
Catalan started with like the fear of

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.960
not knowing

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.639
and it's like

01:29:47.639 --> 01:29:51.260
I don't know it feels like

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:54.480
when you're your most honest and real

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.139
like when you do that it's like it's a

01:29:58.139 --> 01:30:00.360
lot it can be

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.760
especially if it doesn't go with like

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.639
you fitting into a group or your family

01:30:05.639 --> 01:30:08.340
or being at work or whatever

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:11.300
it feels like

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:14.820
it's just real like it's I don't know

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.620
and maybe

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.679
going to that eye place like what Anna

01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:21.300
was saying like

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.940
you know recapturing that eye and taking

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.739
responsibility

01:30:25.739 --> 01:30:27.420
is

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.219
is like honoring that

01:30:33.239 --> 01:30:36.920
which is scary sometimes

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.940
when you first said he was skeptical

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:41.699
when I went back the first thing I

01:30:41.699 --> 01:30:44.760
remember was I don't understand

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.280
now maybe that arose from that sense

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.020
that it's not right

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.080
but it wasn't so much

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:56.280
are you sure it was I don't get it

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.940
foreign

01:31:06.260 --> 01:31:09.480
the word interference and you know

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:12.000
there's there's so much interference

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.159
um to you know

01:31:14.159 --> 01:31:17.219
with our b or to our being

01:31:17.219 --> 01:31:20.400
that that that in in nature in its

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.260
natural state is probably in a certain

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.300
way and then there's this these powerful

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.219
pressures put on us through Society

01:31:26.219 --> 01:31:27.719
through through all these social

01:31:27.719 --> 01:31:30.540
constructs that put like interference

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.480
with our being and then we we respond to

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.600
that by by positioning by kind of

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.679
bending

01:31:37.679 --> 01:31:40.860
and then I think uh the the and I wonder

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:43.020
or I think that the the bending is that

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.179
mind thing that

01:31:45.179 --> 01:31:48.600
um that then you know creates this this

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.179
this bended person and you know there's

01:31:51.179 --> 01:31:52.620
there's all kinds of pressures in

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.380
society like in media they use it a lot

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.139
because it's you know it it invokes all

01:31:58.139 --> 01:31:59.940
kinds of kind of

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:02.639
feelings of sensation in you and it's

01:32:02.639 --> 01:32:04.320
almost like an addiction which they play

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.380
to I think and then

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:10.139
reconnecting to self and then uncovering

01:32:10.139 --> 01:32:12.480
the the interference that you've

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.199
responded to and now dealing with keep

01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:19.020
keeping yourself centered while

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.420
accepting the interference was there but

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.440
not

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.960
not bending anymore

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.840
that that just opens up this this this

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:30.540
new space in yourself that you're kind

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:34.219
of in a way neglected

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.840
um or haven't

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.280
claimed

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.540
well

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:43.820
I'm not sure so now I'm going to

01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:50.000
throw in a atomic bomb here

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.020
so here's a trivial statement which is

01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.420
what is more real

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:01.739
will end up being real right I mean

01:33:01.739 --> 01:33:04.860
if you have like these these

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:08.639
ideas of different Futures obviously the

01:33:08.639 --> 01:33:11.340
one that is more real will become more

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.440
real are you with me there

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.320
can I get a hands up on that thumbs up

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.739
okay so what is more real will become

01:33:19.739 --> 01:33:21.970
real

01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.639
[Music]

01:33:23.639 --> 01:33:27.480
so that's number one and

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:31.020
then you can think about

01:33:31.020 --> 01:33:35.880
like what you said is that

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.580
there are all these mechanisms of

01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.239
delusion

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.139
that

01:33:43.139 --> 01:33:44.820
persist

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:49.020
because they have

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:52.440
positive feedback loops right so I could

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.960
tell my boss that I like him

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.080
there's a positive feedback loop all

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:01.800
these I mean the whole world is run on

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.960
diluted positive feedback loops

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.659
you understand that right like this is

01:34:09.659 --> 01:34:10.440
true

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:12.900
so what if

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:17.520
you took seriously that

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.239
what is real

01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:25.820
is actually the thing you can bet on

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.980
like what if you just really really

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.159
really

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:35.780
internalize that

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.659
now it's not easy to be 100 about what

01:34:42.659 --> 01:34:46.020
is real given the complexity of

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.460
everything

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.040
but

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:54.300
this is one way to

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.840
re

01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:00.179
configure your relationship to business

01:35:00.179 --> 01:35:01.440
let's say

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:03.540
you notice that everybody's walking

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:07.040
around talking about

01:35:07.199 --> 01:35:10.560
reacting to things that you know is not

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.179
real and I'm going to give you a very

01:35:12.179 --> 01:35:14.699
simple example so simple

01:35:14.699 --> 01:35:18.080
that you feel like I'm trivializing

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.600
your question but I'm not I'm trying not

01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:23.900
to

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:27.300
so you know I worked in landscape

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.460
construction for a long time we worked

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:32.880
for Henry Kissinger and Henry and Nancy

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.800
Kissinger were having a state department

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.480
dinner

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.260
one year

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.020
did you hear the story already

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:46.380
no okay so they had like a half a mile

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:49.260
drive where they had she was into white

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.820
white everything

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.820
so she always had these State Department

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:57.540
dinners at a house when the peonies were

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.639
in full blossom and all these white

01:35:59.639 --> 01:36:02.159
things were in full blossom

01:36:02.159 --> 01:36:05.340
and it happened to be a year where it

01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:08.820
was really cold and rainy and the

01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:12.120
peonies erotted

01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:15.060
and she said

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.760
I want them replaced I mean they were 20

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.219
year old peonies

01:36:20.219 --> 01:36:24.060
and the whole office I witnessed went

01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:25.080
into

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.540
like crisis mode they were on the phone

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.120
they were trying to do and I'm like

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.639
I stood on my head in the middle of the

01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:34.679
office

01:36:34.679 --> 01:36:36.239
and people like

01:36:36.239 --> 01:36:38.760
why is she standing on her head because

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.239
like people were

01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:44.639
triggered

01:36:44.639 --> 01:36:49.320
into responses that were not real

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:52.800
you couldn't replace a half a mile of 20

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.020
year old peonies

01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:57.300
it's not real

01:36:57.300 --> 01:37:00.500
it's just not real

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:03.960
and so

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.320
there's this

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:11.699
bonus onus is a real world weird word

01:37:11.699 --> 01:37:15.139
bonus on us

01:37:15.239 --> 01:37:18.120
to be visioners

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.699
but to also understand that hard

01:37:20.699 --> 01:37:24.900
constraints are our friends

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.560
our constraints are our friends

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.800
we're not about like walking into like

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.620
some freaking fantasy

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:37.620
although that is helpful to be imaginal

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.199
and unders and think well what if this

01:37:40.199 --> 01:37:42.920
what if that

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.639
were about understanding

01:37:48.659 --> 01:37:52.080
and partnering partnering

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:55.219
with reality

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.020
in creative ways

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.600
and so

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.540
I forgot actually what triggered this

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.920
but

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:10.260
I don't know maybe I I went too far off

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:13.940
um but maybe you can comment on that

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.820
I'm just thinking this

01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.980
is becoming intimate with those hard

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:23.280
constraints that's how we really develop

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.719
wisdom

01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:27.659
right just like kind of just really

01:38:27.659 --> 01:38:31.560
being in touch with reality like yeah at

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.179
that experience over the past couple of

01:38:33.179 --> 01:38:34.980
weeks being closer to death than I'd

01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:36.060
ever been

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:37.800
I'm just like

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.280
yeah being with it and not

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.020
not trying to

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.480
dissociate from it not trying to just go

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.040
into a story about it but just being

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.900
really present with it okay

01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:53.940
he also kind of felt like when you said

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.600
hard constraints I felt relief

01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:59.639
it's like ah okay

01:38:59.639 --> 01:39:02.159
there's there's something like

01:39:02.159 --> 01:39:03.360
it's

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:04.800
I don't know maybe it's just me but

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.440
sometimes it's like the possibilities

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:09.719
and if it's endless it's like

01:39:09.719 --> 01:39:12.179
it's like I don't know it can be a lot

01:39:12.179 --> 01:39:13.800
it's like

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.139
kind of reminds me of the story of like

01:39:16.139 --> 01:39:18.300
I remember you saying of like going

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.120
under anesthesia and you're like oh

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.580
thank God like it wasn't like you could

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.920
die but it's like all right well it

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.340
like you know my dad died

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:32.480
not my control

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.060
so I don't know what you mean by hard

01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:56.159
constraints

01:39:56.159 --> 01:39:57.600
um the

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.219
um

01:39:59.219 --> 01:40:03.239
the biblical story of feeding the 5 000

01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:06.540
they start with hard constraints

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:10.880
there's a huge crowd and

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.739
and there's very little food

01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:20.300
and so as The Story Goes

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:23.460
please don't take this as a religious

01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:25.980
lecture but it's a story as the story

01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:30.540
goes uh Jesus gives thanks and blesses

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:33.300
the hard constraint

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.100
and

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.199
there's more than enough to feed

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:38.760
everyone

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.659
and my experiences a heart constraint I

01:40:42.659 --> 01:40:44.719
had the other day was

01:40:44.719 --> 01:40:48.420
feeling angry at a friend of mine I've

01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:49.980
talked a lot about anger I got a lot of

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:51.360
bankrupt from right now

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.900
and having no room for love

01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.080
like or not being in touch with love

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.460
of her

01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.199
and

01:41:01.199 --> 01:41:04.199
the grief that's underneath that that I

01:41:04.199 --> 01:41:05.580
wasn't able

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:09.120
because I was angry that and I was in a

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.780
hard world that may seem real like she's

01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:15.179
doing this and it makes me you know and

01:41:15.179 --> 01:41:18.719
it's and it has a real impact on me and

01:41:18.719 --> 01:41:22.139
what and so how do I shift out of that

01:41:22.139 --> 01:41:26.100
hard constraint or and and what I did

01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:30.300
was ask for help the only thing I had to

01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:34.560
do was to say wow

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:39.320
I'm in a place that's too small

01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:42.619
and I like it there

01:41:42.619 --> 01:41:46.260
and I am invested in it and I don't know

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:49.159
how to get bigger

01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:51.659
and

01:41:51.659 --> 01:41:54.840
even just opening the door that little

01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.560
teeny bit

01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:01.699
changed everything for me

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:10.639
foreign

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:14.219
starting there is what is whatever the

01:42:14.219 --> 01:42:16.139
heart constraint is

01:42:16.139 --> 01:42:18.960
what there also is is how we're holding

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.460
what is

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:23.520
how we're fixating fixing ourselves in

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.659
place

01:42:24.659 --> 01:42:28.800
because of how we're holding what is

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.800
um

01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.900
and I want to say something

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:36.600
intimate

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:39.679
about us

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:47.159
every day I've been visiting David uh a

01:42:47.159 --> 01:42:48.900
week now and then I was with my son and

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.540
before that I was with David and and

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:55.159
every day we have these amazing

01:42:55.159 --> 01:42:58.080
connections we're we're calling it

01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.340
coffee time

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:02.159
and I think and then and then the next

01:43:02.159 --> 01:43:03.780
day will come and I think okay this is

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:06.060
going to be an ordinary day this is just

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:10.440
going to be a normal ordinary day and um

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:13.619
and nothing's gonna shift but meanwhile

01:43:13.619 --> 01:43:16.380
something some hard constraint

01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:19.260
has shown up in my life

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:22.920
and maybe I've prayed about it

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.580
and what happens in that

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.280
I think because we've become

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.600
we

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:33.360
come to the altar so to speak or come to

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:35.580
the yoga mat every day

01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:40.020
so often that there's already a current

01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:42.119
of available

01:43:42.119 --> 01:43:43.560
for

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.360
um

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.060
for newness in relationship to whatever

01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.239
happens and so before we know it

01:43:51.239 --> 01:43:53.520
there's all sorts of stuff coming

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:56.100
through and moving and inspiring and

01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.960
there's so much energy and now it's not

01:43:57.960 --> 01:44:00.239
coffee time it's coffee time and then

01:44:00.239 --> 01:44:02.280
lunch time and then it's afternoon time

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.460
and it keeps going on and on and on

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:07.580
um

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.880
so occurs to me to say do you want to

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.940
sing

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.260
well the only thing I want to say is

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:27.540
it's a good question what are hard

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:31.139
constraints yes so I wanna I want to

01:44:31.139 --> 01:44:34.679
talk about how hard constraints

01:44:34.679 --> 01:44:38.780
because they're not negative

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.440
they're the most reliable

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.219
things in the universe okay let me

01:44:47.219 --> 01:44:49.440
explain this

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.300
[Music]

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.820
so

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.340
you could think of like

01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:00.600
imagine trying to fly

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.719
in the airplane and you and someone said

01:45:03.719 --> 01:45:05.100
well

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:07.500
you can't fly because everything falls

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:11.480
to the Earth that's a hard constraint

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:15.780
but without the fact that gravity pulls

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:17.820
everything down to the Earth you could

01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:19.260
not fly

01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:20.340
because

01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:24.119
fly is about the discrepancy between

01:45:24.119 --> 01:45:27.420
pressure of air that's pulled down to

01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:29.719
the Earth

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.400
so hard constraints are actually our

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.639
friend

01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:39.500
this is something to really understand

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:44.820
that the inviolable laws of the universe

01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:48.900
their promises their promises that they

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:53.360
will do this hence I can

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:56.580
I can uh

01:45:56.580 --> 01:46:00.420
I could depend upon them so I say if

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.699
this if the Rock

01:46:02.699 --> 01:46:07.639
or what I said if the stone

01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:11.820
would not agree to lay upon the earth I

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:15.480
could not pick her up and throw it

01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:18.239
because just be

01:46:18.239 --> 01:46:21.300
so hard constraints

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:24.380
are our friends

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.440
every day I will be hungry

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.100
this is your friend and so

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.639
this is another big reframe in the in

01:46:35.639 --> 01:46:39.000
the pop-up school that

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.920
that

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:43.020
there are opportunities to leverage

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.780
that's not what I'm saying but hard

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.060
constraints

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:51.480
are promises promises that the universe

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.760
will hold together in such a way now you

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.260
think about yourself

01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:59.159
I have a tendency to go to anger this

01:46:59.159 --> 01:47:01.860
may be a hard constraint

01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:03.659
but

01:47:03.659 --> 01:47:06.000
if you think of it as a certain kind of

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.960
arousal energy

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.179
that's a hard constraint then you can

01:47:12.179 --> 01:47:14.760
say well what is

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.320
what is the affordance of this

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:22.920
you will probably notice that people

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.440
love you understand what the affordance

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:29.000
of your heart constraint is

01:47:29.219 --> 01:47:33.060
oh yeah she's gonna get angry and that's

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:35.040
workable

01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:37.080
do you see what I'm saying

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.219
like I'm not saying don't get less angry

01:47:41.219 --> 01:47:43.920
that's not what I'm saying but hard

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.480
constraints

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.400
are

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.820
fuels for possibility because they're

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:53.420
predictable

01:47:54.119 --> 01:47:57.300
the fact that the gravity always pulls

01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.040
to the ground

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.060
is a really really big

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.860
thing for me

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:07.020
so

01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:09.600
um that's what I I've written about this

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:12.659
at the sage can see the affordances and

01:48:12.659 --> 01:48:14.159
hard constraints

01:48:14.159 --> 01:48:18.360
so the person who's just like in fantasy

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.060
ran thinks oh there are no hard

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:24.360
constraints I can like fantasize be all

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.520
I can walk through walls and all this

01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:27.540
stuff

01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:31.340
uh that's a fantasy but the sage

01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.100
acknowledges hard constraints and can

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.659
see

01:48:36.659 --> 01:48:40.260
that it affords possibilities that would

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.119
not have been possible if the

01:48:42.119 --> 01:48:44.699
constraints weren't hard

01:48:44.699 --> 01:48:48.480
and if you go back and look at my sage I

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:50.159
think I have three or four Sage things

01:48:50.159 --> 01:48:51.480
so

01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:53.760
this is very important organizations

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.460
like I tell people like people I can

01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:58.920
play oh my boss is always an and

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.080
he's always I'm like but he's always

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.739
like that and they're like yes okay this

01:49:04.739 --> 01:49:07.440
is a good thing because he's predictable

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:09.840
it's a hard constraint

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:12.619
so

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.560
you can you see the incredible we're

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:18.600
talking about practicality incredible

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.400
practicality

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:24.920
of understanding hard constraints does

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:29.219
affording and enormous possibility

01:49:29.219 --> 01:49:32.340
sticky and this perspective will shift

01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:36.960
is very important in terms of

01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.920
practical experience in the world

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.940
it makes me think of yeah

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:45.900
that's just gonna say it makes me think

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.040
of that

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:49.440
um the Paradox of free will decide when

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:51.659
you acknowledge that you don't have it

01:49:51.659 --> 01:49:54.060
in some domain or something is you know

01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.040
constraining you so anyone's you

01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.600
acknowledge it you have the potential to

01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.699
actually expand your pre-work capacity

01:49:59.699 --> 01:50:02.040
exactly whenever you find a hard

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.139
constraint

01:50:04.139 --> 01:50:06.719
on the other side

01:50:06.719 --> 01:50:11.360
you gotta affords because it's 100

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.619
reliable because it's a hard constraint

01:50:15.619 --> 01:50:18.960
you see the perspective come on help me

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.580
out you're laughing here you understand

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.520
it right

01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:28.139
yeah yeah excuse me yes yes I do it's

01:50:28.139 --> 01:50:30.659
I don't know just it's just brilliant

01:50:30.659 --> 01:50:33.540
yeah I've not heard it used with that

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:36.960
word in that way but it's certainly I

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:41.659
experienced that more and more

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:45.119
yeah yeah it's cool thank you sorry I

01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:47.639
I'll try and think of an experience yeah

01:50:47.639 --> 01:50:50.280
it's very tai chi I mean you know my

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.860
background's I teach

01:50:51.860 --> 01:50:54.960
he always leads this way he always leads

01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:57.000
us he always

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.380
okay

01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:01.440
well that's you know that's something to

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:03.780
understand but anyways it's not always

01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:05.940
easy actually I just thought of an

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:08.639
example last night I went to

01:51:08.639 --> 01:51:10.500
um my brother and his wife are going

01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.960
over to live in Tahiti so I went to a

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.179
family get-together where we had a meal

01:51:15.179 --> 01:51:19.139
now my brother is always a certain way

01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:21.600
he has a certain thing with jokes and

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:24.420
the way he perceives and it can be a

01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:25.320
little

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:27.239
sometimes it's a bit

01:51:27.239 --> 01:51:29.760
a little on the edge or a little bit

01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:32.940
nasty maybe one could say but

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:35.880
means because I know this when I'm going

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:38.880
it means how I am with

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:42.840
is it's just it's fine it's absolutely

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:45.480
fine this constraint that he gives means

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.239
that there's so many possibilities

01:51:47.239 --> 01:51:51.060
available in terms of how I respond how

01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:53.400
that affects the person next to me and

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.739
then the whole thing last night was

01:51:55.739 --> 01:51:59.280
Bloody hilarious we had so much fun with

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.619
this constraint that and he always went

01:52:01.619 --> 01:52:03.480
back to it he kept going back and back

01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:07.619
to this same way but it allowed so many

01:52:07.619 --> 01:52:10.440
fun things to happen last night and it

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:13.320
was great I really liked it but I do

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.000
have to say sometimes in those

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.139
situations before I go I need to be I

01:52:19.139 --> 01:52:22.139
catch myself sometimes going into the

01:52:22.139 --> 01:52:23.760
mind I suppose it is I don't know what

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.380
wherever I go

01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:26.100
um

01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:28.560
and getting a little concerned all this

01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.780
might not be nice or this might blah

01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:32.639
blah blah all of this blah blah stuff

01:52:32.639 --> 01:52:35.340
about what might happen and then I'm

01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:37.380
like can you just stop

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.960
it let it go you don't need any of that

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.960
just go knowing what you know and see

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:45.119
what happens anyway and maybe one day he

01:52:45.119 --> 01:52:46.980
won't even have second straight who

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:49.679
knows but at the moment it's very very

01:52:49.679 --> 01:52:51.900
yeah anyway that's all I have to say

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.320
about that

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:57.780
would you say the

01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:59.900
um

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:03.780
the opposite of sort of accepting hard

01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:07.500
constraints is like naive hopefulness

01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:10.139
like oh

01:53:10.139 --> 01:53:13.920
like this person are you asking me yeah

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:18.179
anyone really okay like well I'm always

01:53:18.179 --> 01:53:21.540
in the mind I think growing up naturally

01:53:21.540 --> 01:53:24.780
I maybe I mean I'm very

01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:27.000
my mindset has been oh like

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.780
infinite kind of like possibilities sort

01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:34.500
of so too really in the fantasy I guess

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.540
and

01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:38.639
it's like

01:53:38.639 --> 01:53:41.100
I I've tended to always hold oh there's

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:43.199
always a chance that it could not be a

01:53:43.199 --> 01:53:44.760
hard constraint like there could always

01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:47.880
be like a little oh man what if I just

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.960
you know like and it feels like that has

01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.600
I don't know I can see how that could

01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.500
could help or stop from accepting your

01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.780
heart constraint and then actually using

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.360
it to do something

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:06.960
yeah yeah Max I think for me what was

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:10.280
some coming up here is that I used to

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:15.659
really want really want Pollyanna land

01:54:15.659 --> 01:54:19.580
this was a big thing for me and I often

01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:23.760
would be looking for that

01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:27.239
and it's really it's it's not helpful

01:54:27.239 --> 01:54:30.600
it's it's not helpful at all

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:34.380
um and I would say part of that is a

01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:36.780
response always these things can be a

01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:39.179
response to whatever but I think when I

01:54:39.179 --> 01:54:41.580
look at my sister

01:54:41.580 --> 01:54:45.360
um I see who are wanting Pollyanna land

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.219
and then when she doesn't get Pollyanna

01:54:47.219 --> 01:54:49.800
land she gets really angry and she does

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.960
her thing and goes crazy at me or

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:54.060
someone else and then she's all sorry

01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:57.600
and blah blah but it's very

01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.760
she really wants it to be how it's not

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.340
and she just cannot

01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:06.540
well she at this stage so she can't I

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:09.420
mean she just doesn't yeah all I'm

01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:10.560
thinking of all the time here is

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.060
Pollyanna land

01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:14.639
and I feel that that's also

01:55:14.639 --> 01:55:16.800
for me

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.760
um I really love this effort that we've

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:21.659
been

01:55:21.659 --> 01:55:23.699
I really like just just love their way

01:55:23.699 --> 01:55:25.619
that comes together because

01:55:25.619 --> 01:55:27.960
whenever the arousal arise it's like I'm

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.760
always experimenting with this now so

01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.000
when an arousal arises of anger

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.719
I'm like okay it's just being with that

01:55:36.719 --> 01:55:38.639
because that's real that's actually for

01:55:38.639 --> 01:55:41.460
me now what is part of being real so

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:46.139
what am I seeing what is how am I going

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:49.679
to what is going to satisfy this because

01:55:49.679 --> 01:55:53.100
before I would do care but not real care

01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:55.260
oh no the key would arise and I would do

01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:57.659
care but it wasn't really here

01:55:57.659 --> 01:55:59.880
in fact I would think I'd satisfied it

01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.119
no and then it's just to allow all of it

01:56:03.119 --> 01:56:07.199
to whatever arises just to be with that

01:56:07.199 --> 01:56:08.880
um and I've always sort of said that but

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.040
this is exciting I mean I find this

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:12.719
really exciting what's going to satisfy

01:56:12.719 --> 01:56:16.260
that how is this working oh look at that

01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:19.440
oh he's a it wasn't he

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.440
um like it's just whatever whatever is

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.900
present in the moment and I can't write

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:27.960
a manual or a book or a how to do this

01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:30.239
like this is for this situation this is

01:56:30.239 --> 01:56:32.940
the exit no sorry I can't

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:35.280
it can't be like that and there's still

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:37.560
lots of challenges

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.780
um as well but I love to experiment more

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.179
and more with this now and I have a

01:56:42.179 --> 01:56:45.179
question about that which I uh maybe

01:56:45.179 --> 01:56:46.739
I'll raise it another day

01:56:46.739 --> 01:56:48.179
um because I think we're near the end of

01:56:48.179 --> 01:56:50.040
the time around that

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.940
um yeah yeah but it's enabled me let's

01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.159
finish with your question what's my

01:56:56.159 --> 01:56:58.440
question okay

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.560
um

01:57:00.659 --> 01:57:04.340
do I need a context

01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.960
we talked about

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:10.619
um ethics and we saw how quickly uh we

01:57:10.619 --> 01:57:13.080
can in our culture and I do this though

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.840
from the ethics to the story to the

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:18.540
emotion it gets all blah blah blah and

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:21.599
also it's there is a sense in which we

01:57:21.599 --> 01:57:24.900
also talked about coming from top down

01:57:24.900 --> 01:57:28.440
and how this is has really closes down

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.960
say we're talking about care so we've

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:34.080
closed down effect of care completely

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:37.139
now this is a little diversion

01:57:37.139 --> 01:57:39.119
but one of the things that I'm looking

01:57:39.119 --> 01:57:41.940
at now at the moment in relation to my

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:44.699
family history is I'm actually asking

01:57:44.699 --> 01:57:47.340
some real questions around the Holocaust

01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:50.219
now if I couldn't be with anger and I

01:57:50.219 --> 01:57:52.139
couldn't be with the whole like violence

01:57:52.139 --> 01:57:53.520
and all of that I couldn't be doing

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.159
these questions but what I'm wondering

01:57:56.159 --> 01:58:00.000
and asking myself often here is what has

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.099
happened to care in this context and

01:58:02.099 --> 01:58:05.760
this big context of the Holocaust

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:07.800
um and I'm not I don't know the answer

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:09.719
but I'm wondering

01:58:09.719 --> 01:58:13.080
where have these people gone and it's

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.400
not that

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:16.619
I'm wanting to make a judgment on them

01:58:16.619 --> 01:58:19.080
because we can all go where they went we

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.260
can all be I mean the whole population

01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:25.380
was pretty much complicit and

01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.380
participated in the whole thing and if I

01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:29.880
was there I probably would have as well

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:32.099
possibly don't know that's a big

01:58:32.099 --> 01:58:33.900
question but I just don't know where the

01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:35.239
Kia

01:58:35.239 --> 01:58:38.580
lives anymore in that sense is it

01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:42.060
completely squashed I don't know I'm not

01:58:42.060 --> 01:58:44.360
sure

01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:48.980
the need to help me out

01:58:50.159 --> 01:58:52.280
um

01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:59.880
I was hoping your question would be

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.099
kind of lively

01:59:02.099 --> 01:59:03.080
um

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:07.280
this is endless sadness

01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.080
you know there's this little book called

01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.080
the um

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:14.699
rediscovery in North America

01:59:14.699 --> 01:59:18.599
are uh Barry Lopez I highly recommend it

01:59:18.599 --> 01:59:19.770
it's a tiny little book

01:59:19.770 --> 01:59:22.679
[Music]

01:59:22.679 --> 01:59:25.920
and it talks about the Spaniards coming

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:29.900
into the new world

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:33.719
and destroying all the cultures that

01:59:33.719 --> 01:59:35.219
were there

01:59:35.219 --> 01:59:37.280
um

01:59:38.639 --> 01:59:42.060
it's kind of a holocaust right it's a

01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:43.739
holocaust of

01:59:43.739 --> 01:59:48.679
20 30 40 50 cultures

01:59:51.719 --> 01:59:53.880
so

01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.400
I think

01:59:56.400 --> 01:59:59.219
the move here is to say this is Who We

01:59:59.219 --> 02:00:00.179
Are

02:00:00.179 --> 02:00:02.780
yeah

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.639
this is who we are and not that's who

02:00:05.639 --> 02:00:08.119
they are or whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah

02:00:08.119 --> 02:00:10.619
this is who we are Inspire our

02:00:10.619 --> 02:00:13.020
commercial love Faith says we're on a

02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:15.500
slave ship

02:00:15.659 --> 02:00:19.040
this is Who We Are

02:00:26.219 --> 02:00:29.040
I think it's an interesting question is

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:32.900
like when did we become this

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:35.880
and I'm not saying it's

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.719
in the Advent of colonialism

02:00:39.719 --> 02:00:42.960
uh at one point we're just a species of

02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:47.540
animals so we weren't like that

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.880
um

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:55.679
so that's how I would start this

02:00:55.679 --> 02:00:59.880
question like at some point

02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:02.820
we're just animals and then we're like

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.560
kind of human animals and

02:01:07.619 --> 02:01:11.219
um we don't have this power and then at

02:01:11.219 --> 02:01:12.300
some point

02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:16.619
all across the globe this is the kind of

02:01:16.619 --> 02:01:18.420
uh

02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:21.659
behaviors or results we have

02:01:21.659 --> 02:01:23.460
collectively that's an interesting

02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:27.659
question to to ask it that way right so

02:01:27.659 --> 02:01:31.199
I just want to say that the Holocaust

02:01:31.199 --> 02:01:34.040
and

02:01:34.199 --> 02:01:36.260
um

02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:39.000
what we did in the new world is very

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.440
similar the the the total Extinction of

02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:45.480
certain cultures and now we're

02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:50.940
Extinction of other animals

02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:52.199
um

02:01:52.199 --> 02:01:55.199
but this notion of like

02:01:55.199 --> 02:01:57.119
it's not a hard constraint I don't think

02:01:57.119 --> 02:02:01.080
it's like this is who we are Maybe

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.900
maybe this is Who We Are

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:05.940
if it's already constrained that's an

02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:08.099
interesting question but to put to

02:02:08.099 --> 02:02:11.420
actually think about it

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:17.280
openly like that and see

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:19.139
what you learn you know it's a thought

02:02:19.139 --> 02:02:21.780
experiment so

02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.900
um

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.880
you know I think that we don't do this

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:35.400
in the pop-up School

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.880
it's online it's not easy

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:41.659
but

02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:44.580
everything we do here in the pop-up

02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.780
School

02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:48.619
has

02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:54.119
a

02:02:54.119 --> 02:02:56.940
aspect of it that's not included and

02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:59.040
that is these what I call monstrous

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.440
conversations

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:04.679
and I'm not happy to do them online I

02:03:04.679 --> 02:03:07.260
don't think you can do them online

02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:10.980
but I don't think the deepest questions

02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:15.000
that you're starting to

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.760
think about or

02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.820
uh bump into

02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:22.520
our

02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:25.139
resolvable without

02:03:25.139 --> 02:03:27.800
that

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:36.060
from my own experience like

02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:38.880
but this attitude of like this is who we

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:41.340
are this is what we do

02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:44.340
not overly

02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:47.099
you know you don't get emotionally too

02:03:47.099 --> 02:03:50.460
depressed or whatever like you just

02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.199
be with it

02:03:52.199 --> 02:03:54.840
um this is not something we we have done

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.739
at the pop-up School I'm not sure that

02:03:58.739 --> 02:04:01.500
want to do it online so

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:04.619
okay okay so I'll just leave there yeah

02:04:04.619 --> 02:04:07.860
but I mean I hope I'm in this I mean I'm

02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:09.780
sitting in this so but thank you for

02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:11.880
that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:13.199
it's definitely in the literature

02:04:13.199 --> 02:04:15.360
there's a move towards everyone

02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:17.760
could have done that I mean this this is

02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.400
where they're going and and yeah yeah so

02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:23.580
it's a question of

02:04:23.580 --> 02:04:27.119
it's it's an interesting question yeah

02:04:27.119 --> 02:04:30.119
but we're building capacity here so

02:04:30.119 --> 02:04:34.020
maybe uh we can go there

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:37.020
and and just and you know

02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:40.139
so one day

02:04:40.139 --> 02:04:45.540
before the internet you know I'm older

02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:47.820
um we had this little bookstore in this

02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:51.780
little town where I used to work

02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:53.639
and

02:04:53.639 --> 02:04:56.040
you know I'd be on lunch break or

02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:57.840
something and I like to like browse at

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:00.420
the bookstore and

02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:02.520
I had a lot of art books and this and

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:04.500
that and they had

02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:08.280
um James naturally do you know him

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:11.400
uh James naturally

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:14.400
I didn't know him and I was just

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.239
browsing and I was like oh go in that

02:05:18.239 --> 02:05:21.480
corner with this huge book

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:25.500
and it was called uh let me see if I can

02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:27.179
find it

02:05:27.179 --> 02:05:29.219
um

02:05:29.219 --> 02:05:31.739
and if you want to come

02:05:31.739 --> 02:05:34.280
here

02:05:37.139 --> 02:05:39.800
uh

02:05:42.420 --> 02:05:45.840
okay so it's this book

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.659
it's a very large format book that I

02:05:48.659 --> 02:05:51.139
have here

02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:58.340
and it was just like in this corner

02:05:58.860 --> 02:06:01.800
and now it might like my hand was like I

02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.540
had to go there

02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:06.920
and I bought this book

02:06:08.099 --> 02:06:11.280
and it changed my life but it's a very

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:15.420
very very deep descent

02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:19.820
into the dark side of humanity

02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:22.440
without it

02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:24.360
um

02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:26.580
the teachings of the pop-up School are

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:30.320
not complete let me just say that

02:06:31.199 --> 02:06:33.360
Bonita I

02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:35.880
um want to take a contrary point of view

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:39.599
and say that even the Good Samaritan

02:06:39.599 --> 02:06:42.780
story even Ilitch the Good Samaritan

02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:45.380
story is

02:06:45.380 --> 02:06:49.980
leans into that where did the caring go

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:54.179
yes I think that the direction of the

02:06:54.179 --> 02:06:57.960
pop-up School into

02:06:58.679 --> 02:07:02.940
um be values and being more human

02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:05.699
requires

02:07:05.699 --> 02:07:09.420
looking back and looking forward and

02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:11.699
going through as you put today the hard

02:07:11.699 --> 02:07:13.500
constraints

02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:16.920
so I understand I think what you're

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:19.860
saying that this is not the best format

02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:24.239
to talk about a time in history

02:07:24.239 --> 02:07:27.119
and I think I understand what you're

02:07:27.119 --> 02:07:31.260
saying that in order to talk about that

02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:34.020
kind of thing we need to ask the

02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:36.179
questions publicly

02:07:36.179 --> 02:07:37.500
yeah

02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:39.599
I mean it's hard to have monstrous

02:07:39.599 --> 02:07:42.380
conversations

02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:44.639
and

02:07:44.639 --> 02:07:45.480
um

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:48.300
maybe that's next next year

02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:52.619
pop up 2023 monstrous monstrous

02:07:52.619 --> 02:07:55.679
conversations with monsters the monsters

02:07:55.679 --> 02:07:57.960
that we are and the monsters that we

02:07:57.960 --> 02:07:59.219
produce

02:07:59.219 --> 02:08:03.300
I mean at some point

02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:06.540
um that's part of the journey right you

02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:08.520
need to build capacity and then you need

02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:11.239
to be able to

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:16.159
look at reality

02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:20.099
and then that reality becomes hard

02:08:20.099 --> 02:08:23.460
constraints and you see possibility you

02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:25.980
know so

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:27.840
yeah

02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:29.940
it's been excellent

02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.619
um session

02:08:31.619 --> 02:08:34.679
I hope you all uh

02:08:34.679 --> 02:08:37.139
uh so we all

02:08:37.139 --> 02:08:39.199
um

02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:42.179
gain something from reception a session

02:08:42.179 --> 02:08:44.840
like this but we also have the recording

02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.520
that's in service to other people who

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:49.139
are watching it and I think this is

02:08:49.139 --> 02:08:52.860
something that uh will be very valuable

02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:55.260
to other people and I thank you so much

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:59.900
for being a part of making this happen

02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:03.649
[Music]



## Cohort 3

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.360
foreign

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.300
[Music]

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.480
so this is uh

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.120
one cohort three color three of the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.480
recap it's really an open mic

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040
um but I'm also interested in

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.120
um

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.719
yeah recapping like what did this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.039
journey

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.879
uh what stood out for you this journey

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.379
um we talked a little bit how it changed

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.940
might have changed some of our outlook

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.039
on life where the way we experience

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.840
things

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960
um

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.479
also if there are still some whoa all

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.000
these people coming in if there are

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780
still um

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.520
some distinctions that some people want

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.230
to talk about

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.280
[Music]

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.860
um well you know what is the question or

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.320
where is

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.680
where is why does it matter

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.960
why isn't

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.240
what do we have to say in the world why

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.100
are they wrong and we're right if you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.900
want to put in plan three

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.320
uh what what what's the argument about I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.180
don't know

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.900
um

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.460
any of those things or or just uh

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.680
uh yeah what's going on today how you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.920
feeling

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm in a little weird space because my

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.060
sister just left and we had a kind of a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.619
difficult week with my mom and

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.820
it turned into a conversation between

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.740
herself and me like what are we gonna do

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.360
with that old like we could see

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.700
ourselves like this was our trajectory

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.840
and so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.940
we just had a nice lunch and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.520
conversation about that so yeah it's

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.020
open for uh any and all of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.180
let's just be here enjoy our

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.280
conversation and enjoy our company

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.060
yeah I just wanted to bring up something

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.099
that's been coming up for me

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.940
um

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.620
just how this courses opened up so much

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.099
and it's been so rich and fulfilling and

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.900
um such a beautiful orientation to the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.700
world and also as I'm starting to really

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.640
notice how deep the malware runs

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.360
um

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.680
just how painful it also really is like

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.780
um how frustrating it really feels

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.959
sometimes to recognize

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.459
about

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.459
um little I see and how kind of

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.940
possessed I can get by my thoughts

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.379
um and so it's just been a real struggle

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.940
I mean keep trying to come back to that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.580
elocentric but sometimes it just feels

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.060
Relentless and overwhelming and like too

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.319
big to take on sometimes

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.200
thank you ollie the first thing that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.860
um

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.420
I've had a

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.420
absolutely

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.140
bizarre week

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.299
um the one previous to this

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.560
because

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760
um I actually went to a retreat

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.420
um a warm data Retreat and I've been

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.980
you know working with this

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.760
inquiry

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.720
since March 2020.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.299
and

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.780
um it was

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.239
so bizarre to all of a sudden be in what

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.579
we call in real life with people I've

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.859
seen

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.540
um

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.400
um Zoom

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.380
basis

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.280
and

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.060
I I felt this

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.780
um

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.639
you know intense confirmation of what

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.900
led me

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.820
to come here to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.740
the pop-up School

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.400
and yet I I couldn't really

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.979
speak to it

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:53.880
um

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.280
I mean didn't have to either but

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.720
um despite chance I I watched

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.400
um

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.240
a question funny you post to David Kelly

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.540
on his book

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.720
that where you referred to

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.780
uh him quoting

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.500
um

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.840
evangelich

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.600
on the

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.560
having come out of the Bates and spell

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.759
and I went back to find that passage to

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.580
help me sort of navigate

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.060
my

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.539
very unward sense of

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.580
how to navigate

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.680
this

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.580
kind of

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.800
uh

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.680
when do I call it parallax

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.500
it's kind of a parallax

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.880
um

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.160
and

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.360
I just uh I really want to

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.259
attempt to speak to

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.479
oh

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.500
how important it was to feel

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.020
like even though I couldn't articulate

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.520
it

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.380
it really helped me

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.639
somehow

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.319
navigate

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.160
that experience and

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.840
you know

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.520
I think one of the things that

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.819
stuck out for me was you know how

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.240
Spinoza says we don't yet know what a

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.880
body can do

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.539
I I really feel like that's what you are

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:59.460
not only

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.460
unraveling

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.479
but also clearly something that we're a

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.460
long way from knowing what

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.840
thought in a body can do

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.919
and

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.340
you know I feel like

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.780
it's been

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.520
um a beginning of a very different way

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.880
home

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.560
even

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.560
if

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.699
um

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.220
I guess

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.979
I'm also

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.220
deeply moved by

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.340
the the care and and

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.360
the labor and the

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.199
dwellings

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:04.560
or maybe even better

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.560
dilation

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.940
of the space of the people

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.940
who have surrounded you in this work

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.639
it's

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.039
deeply moving

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:26.520
um and so so so necessary

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.379
and even though I'm a newbie still I

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:36.959
feel and it's okay to the pop-up School

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.080
um

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.500
you know

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.940
um

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.700
it's it's

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.339
the the

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:51.180
rigorous Attunement to this kind of belt

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.740
uh

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.959
singularity

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:58.140
you know of each of us

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.540
being a body

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.519
and feeling thought

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.899
and

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:11.040
and the way the learning kind of

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.480
glitches

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.880
glitches

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.820
you know

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.640
previously unnoticed

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.760
um

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.640
other wiseness

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.899
and and and the outside Finds Its way

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:33.180
inside

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:39.120
and you kind of swim in these floaty

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.120
ambiguities

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.860
and and I love the way the geek thinking

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.180
game seems to be played very differently

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.779
like

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.300
I feel like Bonnie you

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.959
you sneakily add another chair every

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:03.480
time the Music Stops instead of taking

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.140
one away

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.700
you know

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.600
um

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.540
and

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.800
the ways of the intergenerational

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.920
attending to the extra of the ordinary

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.320
is you know has no sort of flailing

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.040
you know

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.720
um but with just the right amount of

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.820
playfulness necessary to

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:43.019
Dodge and Duck and dignify all these

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:45.860
pins and needles

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.320
and and and which doesn't preclude

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.220
arriving at moments of

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.660
serendipitous insight

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.959
and I'll close by

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:03.660
saying that it's also

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.420
to me

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.100
profoundly sincere

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.920
and and I go to the

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.360
kind of etymology of that word which is

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.339
very curious

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:20.820
um which means without wax

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.899
because if the marble

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:28.440
um of the sculpture was chipped cracked

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.680
or damaged dishonest sculptor would melt

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.260
lacks into the marble dust

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.380
using it to conceal the flaw

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:39.959
or imperfection

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:43.260
so an honest Sculptor

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.019
would make the statement that the

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:50.760
sculpture was seen Etc without wax

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.160
and that's what I

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.120
have encountered here again and again

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.620
and I feel like I have to start the

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.279
whole course over

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:05.040
during the rest of the summer before the

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.820
fall

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.079
in order to even

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.480
you know

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.899
continue to walk in this other way home

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.680
so yeah

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.380
and I thought I was gonna cry it might

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.860
still happen

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.800
thank you I just want to say

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.579
um I'm very much aware how tough it is

00:12:44.579 --> 00:12:47.639
when you first get in to this course

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.680
you know and

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.459
um in remembering you as a new student

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:55.980
or whatever because you know people come

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.680
in and they want to

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.740
contribute and shine and and we're doing

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.720
something so weird here that it's like

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.420
nah not that when you first come in it's

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.260
like yeah good try but nah it's not that

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.019
so there's a lot of I mean does anybody

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:16.500
experience that like At first like yeah

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.060
and so on this end uh I just want to

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.200
reflect back that I realized it it takes

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.920
a certain stubbornness and and and of

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.620
course magazine what was helpful by the

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.300
time you joined is you're like the one

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.920
of these what do these other people look

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.660
like they're having such a good time you

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.040
know what I mean

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.920
um but it is a and it takes different

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.320
forms like you know the Zen people who

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.079
are all empty of self I tease them in a

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:48.839
certain way and there's this there's

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:52.380
this uh

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.380
there's this door Christ defeat you have

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:01.519
to pay uh so I just kudos to people who

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:04.440
um

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.240
do the work I mean it's not easy to to

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.160
um go through that that

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:18.899
I I recognize is it can be

00:14:18.899 --> 00:14:20.639
an initial

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:23.399
uh challenge so

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:25.320
um

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.720
yeah I don't know I guess that must make

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.180
sense to everyone yeah

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.139
um because it is in a sense

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.360
there's something uncompromising about

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.279
what we're doing but it's not any of the

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:40.139
things you think were uncompromising

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:42.600
about I don't even know what to say what

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.940
it is because we're not uncompromising

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.760
about being embodied versus being this

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.279
or being that versus being that or

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.440
whatever that's hard to find but there

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.139
is a sense that

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:57.779
uh we're holding each other up to

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:59.820
uncompromising and and I just want to

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.399
say that um it's it's gotten so it's not

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:04.560
only me now

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.139
so for example someone said Claudia said

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:08.940
last time something about not findable

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.699
and we we sat with that and it was true

00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:15.899
but then someone said but you know like

00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:18.720
um this is this is not saturated fully

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.480
saturated with understanding yet right

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.240
and so this notion of

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.519
not being fully saturated with

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.980
understanding and if it's not then keep

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.820
it open and if it is then move on uh so

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.579
yeah so there's something that I just

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:38.820
want to acknowledge on the other side of

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.760
the compliment is always

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.639
uh work that people are doing on the

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.620
other side to make it happen amongst

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.320
other things just just pointing this

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.459
particular

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:53.160
one out and other people want to speak

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.940
to that that's cool too but yeah like at

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.100
the beginning I don't even let you use

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.620
words right the way you want to use

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.420
words stuff like that

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.260
yeah David

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.279
um thank you it was me that raised the

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:16.440
hand I don't know how to lower him

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.060
you get this out of this space

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.720
oh my God Marie

00:16:24.839 --> 00:16:27.019
um

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.959
I raise my hand because of what you said

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:36.600
about your day and your week Bonnie

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.839
and I raise my hand in response to

00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:44.180
madalena and Holly

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.560
to try to trigger

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.399
the ability to thrive in the pop-up

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:59.339
school here and now and moving into the

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:00.899
fall

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:05.819
the ability to thrive here now

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:09.959
and I think it's going to take 17 of us

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:15.079
so I invite you all into my

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:20.120
what do we call it cramming session

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.339
cramming session

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.679
and I'm really talking to Sandra and

00:17:25.679 --> 00:17:28.220
array too

00:17:32.179 --> 00:17:35.760
this is mystery and genius

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.760
2023

00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:54.120
so my attention

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.840
this morning and we got into

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.840
Kairos so the time is gone so I couldn't

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.760
cram so I'm lighting you into my

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.539
cramming room

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.580
you know

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.799
we did seven modules

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:19.820
in a row

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.600
oh my tension my tension is I love

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.120
conviviality and I love your stories the

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.100
warm data Retreat the difficulty holding

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:36.900
life's reality I love that you know me

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.360
and yet

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.780
I look at this word recap and I want to

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.620
go back and reflect on what the things

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.700
that brought me to today are

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.320
how does memory

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.700
dovetail with the justification system

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.940
not how does it sit next to it how does

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.299
it dovetail in my present time now

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:09.799
how does perception

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.220
elegantly fit into disposition affect

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.620
and emotion

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.840
so that's what I want to cram on today

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.020
so that we can create a new theory in

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.940
the days ahead so that we can thrive in

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.460
this mystery

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.220
that Bonnie somehow is trying to share

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.760
with us

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.900
so I'm going to drop a couple of quotes

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.919
and see and I'm here to

00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:01.080
I want to start by giving you a massage

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.100
and then I want to start and continue by

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.799
seeing where it leads do we lead into a

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:10.380
breakout do we do what do we do here

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.780
today to

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.660
support thriving together

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.700
to going out on the walk this afternoon

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.799
was you know it's morning here you go

00:20:19.799 --> 00:20:21.059
out and walk

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:23.460
and so I can bring Katie with me and

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.240
evil with me

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.640
memory it is selective and in service of

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.900
presence

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.700
or future

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.020
and get shaped by what we want to be the

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.700
case

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.960
rather than

00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:50.720
what was actually the case

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.299
as we build our taxonomy of embodied

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:05.160
experience

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
it is important to distinguish what we

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.880
mean by imagination

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:18.440
from what we mean by virtual perception

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.720
flux is a form of flow

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.360
but not one

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.919
but with one crucial difference

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:38.720
water can flow in a river or traffic

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.380
down a street

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.220
what goes

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.440
in at one end

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.500
and what comes out at the other

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.880
is the same thing water

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.760
or cars in Biochemistry Lux is the flow

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.640
of things that are transformed along the

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.320
way

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.740
imagine a car entering a street let's

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.960
say it's a VW Beetle

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.960
no certainly no sooner has it gone 10

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.659
yards down

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:19.860
then there's a blinding Flash and it

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.000
becomes a Volvo

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:28.980
affect Laden arousal energy therefore is

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.760
part of the primordial

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.500
perceptual stream

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.400
it is what affords the energy of the

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.039
perceptual motion

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:44.700
the seed as it were that germinates

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.360
but also what constrains the search

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.380
field to Gold directed

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.280
purposeful relevance

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.900
I'll just give my statement the Elegance

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.880
of pure abstraction the Elegance of math

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.320
and pure abstraction

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.720
meaning and the justification system

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.480
so what's your disposition right now

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.840
right or Sandra

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.780
what is it like to be me

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.919
In This Moment

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.700
wobbly

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.100
excited

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.299
something like this

00:24:03.299 --> 00:24:06.500
in listening to you

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.620
and

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.950
what Drew my attention

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.059
[Music]

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:19.799
was the the

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:22.260
shaping

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.360
that we do

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.000
in memory

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.020
so the particular thing that just came

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.679
that I remembered was

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:38.280
losing the key to my car

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.880
recently and insisting like I know it

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.220
was on the dining room table

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.039
my husband must have taken it

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.919
because it looks just like his key and

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:53.039
he's he's that kind of person who puts

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:55.440
all the keys in his pocket

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.559
but that wasn't the case and I kept

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.720
looking and kind of being in that

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:02.940
vigilant

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.460
it's got to be somewhere I want to find

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.340
it I want to find it I want to find it

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.840
and then

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.720
in the same way that things often happen

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.700
when I've lost them

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:21.419
I sat down to put on my shoes

00:25:21.419 --> 00:25:23.340
and I had the thought I want that key

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.779
right now

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:27.659
and I picked up my sneaker and it was in

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:30.260
my sneaker

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.580
so that's kind of

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.840
how it is at the pop-up school for me

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.460
that that

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:46.380
flux

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.779
a sneaker is not just a sneaker it's a

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:51.360
key holder

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.340
um is happening more and more

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.940
and I love that you want us to like

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.919
Assemble

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:06.539
and reconfigure and

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:10.500
um marinade or digest or some you know

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.779
something

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:15.000
that

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.120
um

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:20.960
gathers us

00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.960
and

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.200
as Bonnie said kind of you know it's

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.799
there's always movement and

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:34.620
sort of this evolutionary

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.340
potential

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.700
of the whole

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.360
and I think you know to just add one

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:53.039
more thing the appreciation

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:56.520
that I've had and have

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.720
In This Moment

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:06.419
that the screen in front of me is

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:08.820
feels

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.320
not at all virtual

00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:15.779
like increasingly I have a deepening

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:20.580
sense of who these humans are that some

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:25.279
some I've seen in person and many not

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:28.559
and the connections feel very strong and

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.080
and

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.100
real and

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.059
nourishing

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.080
so I'll pass it over to Marie

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.960
with her hand waving in the corner

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.860
Marie you have to unmute

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.320
there we go thank you

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.260
so going back to

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.919
um what is challenging about

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:23.220
uh this the the learning we're being

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.380
invited into here

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.760
and

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.659
um

00:28:27.659 --> 00:28:31.740
I'm wanting to kind of Express see if I

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.080
can put words to my own

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.240
um experience of that

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.840
one thing that I love about

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.220
um

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.240
the modules is the Precision

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.940
that is

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:53.039
um kind of core you know that there's

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:56.940
um a preciseness to the definitions and

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.919
the different concepts

00:28:58.919 --> 00:29:05.240
and yet at the same time when I try and

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.120
pass that through my mind to articulate

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.700
something it's like

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.059
I'm reminded a bit of what it's like

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:17.880
when I wake up in the morning and try

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.659
and tell about a dream like the more I

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:25.320
talk about it the more like the dream is

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:31.190
just gone like the access and is is

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.620
[Music]

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.460
um

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.440
it like there's

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.500
um

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.500
it just doesn't work that way right to

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.179
be able to access the content of a dream

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:47.299
um

00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:52.500
and similarly oftentimes when I try and

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.500
access the Precision of the language in

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.279
some of the modules it sort of just

00:29:58.279 --> 00:30:01.980
dissolves on me and it's it's like I'm

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.919
using the wrong

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:07.860
the wrong quality of mind like trying to

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.159
use

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.659
um

00:30:12.659 --> 00:30:15.480
I'm reminded of the quote that you put

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.240
in the chat last time

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.679
Bonnie about how I want to

00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:26.940
um dance I wanna I want my body to

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.159
express dance I'm not going to get the

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:30.720
words right

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.880
um I want my mind to be able to

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.500
um

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.200
to think in the way that my body

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.100
responds to dancing you're gonna

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.020
um

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.080
and it's without the mind

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.880
um

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.140
something like that

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.799
so

00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:57.659
um

00:30:57.659 --> 00:31:00.200
yeah

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.100
that's what I wanted to say

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.679
David

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:20.039
I'm David I'm curious why is it that I

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:21.419
heard that you said you wanted to hear

00:31:21.419 --> 00:31:24.919
from me as well is that correct

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:32.659
two or three times I said that okay

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.240
um

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.940
so

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.919
talked about this a while ago the way

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.539
that

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:47.159
um

00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:51.120
a few years ago I decided to

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.299
try to digest this kind of information

00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:58.559
was by making lots of notes and reading

00:31:58.559 --> 00:32:00.860
and rereading and

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.919
and I realized that that's not how I

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:08.299
learn it's not how I'm gonna

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:13.020
kind of uh I don't even know

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.779
how to say it but

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:20.100
to to to to allow

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.940
the experience of life to to have a kind

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.919
of poignancy

00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:28.799
and directness that

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:32.100
um is a base of longing for for as long

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.380
as I can remember

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.200
so there was there was this a handful of

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.120
teachings over the past couple of years

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.000
in a pop-up School

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.700
that seemed so

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.940
rich and poignant and and kind of

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.880
saturated that I just keep returning to

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.080
those

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.820
and then

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.039
the other course materials kind of

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:57.899
filler

00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:01.279
it's not filler it

00:33:02.279 --> 00:33:04.200
part of the teaching comes through in

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.539
certain ways that fortifies

00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:09.899
this this kind of I'm going to call it

00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:12.840
Simplicity but it's anything but simple

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.940
this this kind of Simplicity that's

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.860
that's

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.700
that I think is has become

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.700
more and more apparent

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.860
um and it's it's

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.320
there's a reciproc um

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.179
that's not the right word there's a

00:33:30.179 --> 00:33:32.640
relationality

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.519
if I go for a walk and I see some weeds

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:39.059
happen the other day again

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:41.039
these weeds are like

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.899
I don't know they're moving in slow

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:46.440
motion like there there's more of

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.840
there's not more weeds but there's more

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.419
of the weed that's available and

00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:55.220
sometimes it's so striking that

00:33:55.799 --> 00:34:00.299
I that the visual continues a good half

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:02.340
mile down the road

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.740
and I can still see these weeds kind of

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.520
unfolding

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.300
and

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.639
and so there's that that I've kind of

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:21.300
finally figured out to just let alone

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.099
and

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:24.659
um

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.260
let that unfold as it does

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.960
and the other thing that was

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.260
that was uh really

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.760
struck me

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.300
um was Bonnie when you posted some of um

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.980
Christopher Alexander's writings

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:42.540
on

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.080
on in in a sense the eye that I

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.659
experience as as so-called mind is

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:51.179
actually the the presence of the eye of

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.919
the universe

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:57.619
of the presence of Eye of life and

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.820
and that

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.760
just kind of lives on my shoulder

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.280
now

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.380
um

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.960
and so that sense of I started thinking

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.079
about everybody just this sense of I it

00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:18.060
it didn't have to be cultivated it

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.240
cultivated it was given

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.099
it was just freely given

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.020
so there's a there's a kind of Grace for

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.540
me in that

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.180
and there's a Grace for me in letting

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.099
myself learn the way that I learn and

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.380
I remember back in the early days we

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.640
were Elder Lauren

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.200
Bonnie looked at me and said something

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.680
like like don't you say anything

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.780
or

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.880
you always do this you don't say

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.060
anything

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.220
and there's something about learning how

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.480
to let that

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.020
be

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:16.200
um and because the moment I try to

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.960
perform that not only is it gone it's

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.339
just it's just silly

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.920
so

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.339
this course and all the material

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:32.700
all the all the nuance and the uh the

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.859
Precision like Marie mentioned

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:37.560
and all the incredible depth

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.619
most of which it seems like I miss but

00:36:40.619 --> 00:36:42.240
there's quality there's threads of it

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:43.260
that have

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.200
feeding me tremendously like I can't

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.460
even I can't imagine

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.359
and so yeah that the other part of this

00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:59.880
is this I I just finished for the sixth

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:03.540
time reading wild mind wild Earth

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.660
and there's something in in that little

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.119
book that uh just keeps feeding back

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:11.480
into

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.619
what we're all learning at the pop-up

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:15.920
screen

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.260
all right one one last thing there's

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.760
something

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.680
and I I never thought that I would say

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.920
this

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.619
but there but there's there's but the

00:37:55.619 --> 00:37:57.960
only thing that's left is

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.260
even with the weeds is this feeling of

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.079
love this relationality that

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:07.859
is is always available and it's like

00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:10.380
overwhelming sometimes

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.820
so I would

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.560
I don't know what else to call that but

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.800
love

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:42.119
and a shitload of gratitude for all of

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:44.240
you

00:39:16.619 --> 00:39:19.619
foreign

00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:25.579
thank you Ray

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:30.920
I'm a bit emotional but my memory

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.540
organizes around

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.980
arriving at Bonnie's Ranch driving with

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.140
an hours

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.660
arriving and Sandy saying no I don't

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.359
park there pointing over park over there

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:49.460
and in the distance I saw you

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.460
but I find my way into the house and got

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.680
ready and hugged and kissed a few of you

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.240
and I saw you

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.060
in the Corral

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.640
when I saw you on the side of the

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.380
mountain

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.020
and I saw you on the side of the barn

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.160
and

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.160
silence

00:40:17.579 --> 00:40:18.839
in

00:40:18.839 --> 00:40:21.859
our world

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:26.400
and as I sit here listening to you

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.839
I feel the same kind of Grace

00:40:30.839 --> 00:40:34.140
that opened up the door for me to feel

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.880
the horses

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.380
and feel you and to be a Marine

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.760
and who else oh

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.119
maybe young about it so thank you for

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:49.980
the grace of sharing yourself with us

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.300
today right

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.400
thank you for sharing yourself with me

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.000
on that day

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.020
Bonnie I have a question

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.359
the quote that you put in I want the

00:41:30.359 --> 00:41:32.400
words to come out of my mouth the way

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.920
the dance comes out of my body entirely

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.240
free of my mind

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.820
is entirely free of my mind or is it

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.420
entirely free of

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.820
the mind

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.460
entirely a mind free of entirely free of

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.820
malware

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.020
is it you know well that's a big

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.380
question

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.240
and is that possible

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.640
it hurts well it's definitely possible

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.260
but then of course it also requires us

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.560
being precise with what we mean by mind

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.020
versus what we don't mean by mind and

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.960
blah blah blah but

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.540
um I would say mind here

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.240
maps onto

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.540
um so I'm gonna use

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.839
first thing I use Greg Enriquez

00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:46.380
system you know he has animal Minds we

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.900
call it animal nature

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.660
and then he has

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.839
um

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.040
not sure he calls it mind one human mind

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.500
one and then he has minds too which is

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.560
the justification system

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.579
narrative representation

00:43:10.579 --> 00:43:13.319
uh what else what did I call narrative

00:43:13.319 --> 00:43:15.240
representation justification system

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.319
that's what I wanted to be free of

00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:21.960
um but for me when you're free of that

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.839
it's you're you're really basically

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.560
uh very close to working with the you

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.420
know animal nature you're still

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.839
simulating the animals can simulate sub

00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:40.339
language animals have language

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.680
but you're not in narrative or the

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.020
justification system now having said

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.619
that I like to tell stories but that's

00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:52.260
different than narrative mind that

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.660
even the stories I tell even the stories

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.900
I tell about me for my childhood

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.940
I don't even know how to relate to them

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.339
whether they're real or that to me or

00:44:02.339 --> 00:44:04.380
they're not they're they're useful and

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.380
they arise in the moment

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.839
um because they're brought out by what's

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:12.480
ever happening in the moment

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.599
um and so

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:18.119
I heard myself tell the same story in

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:19.980
different ways sometimes it's just the

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.920
same story that wants to come out

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.780
um so that's what I would mean by mind

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.940
that part that we talked about narrative

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.920
the justification system and Ice

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.040
representational thinking

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.260
um it

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.160
what I'm saying isn't

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.079
representing anything really there it's

00:44:40.079 --> 00:44:42.300
this use of language is pointing out or

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.119
pointing to something

00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:46.800
um

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.079
sometimes it's a little more complex

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:51.480
because I'd be pointing out a passage in

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.400
a book that then points to something

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.940
we're talking about so it could have

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.579
oh it could be layered in a certain way

00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:02.280
it was a certain complexity to it but

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.560
that's the closest I can get to say I

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.380
mean I hope you you heard what I just

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.460
said is

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:13.440
I literally mean it like entirely free

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.000
of

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.800
what he calls mind

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.260
to

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:20.400
um

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.079
and

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:24.200
um

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.060
so my the mind also that is free of is

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.599
the mind that expects a goal okay I have

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:35.339
a goal I'm gonna say something I have a

00:45:35.339 --> 00:45:37.560
goal at the end and I'm going to Fashion

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.140
what I say to keep moving toward that

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.700
goal

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:43.619
um so sometimes I do that sometimes I

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:45.300
have to do that especially when I'm

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.940
talking to people like Greg and I'm like

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.660
how can I say this different but

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.940
that's not what you know I want I want

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.200
this other thing to happen

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.200
um single Loop you know single Loop

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.140
speaking not covet compiles your

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.420
sentences and

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.180
go forward and backwards and stuff like

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.680
that so that's that's kind of what I

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.560
mean about it and of course dancing with

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.540
entirely free of your mind's not easy

00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.540
either right who's watching me you know

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.420
you know so the difficulty is not of a

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.579
different order

00:46:23.579 --> 00:46:26.700
because sometimes it's hard to dance

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.119
free of your self-conscious mind or you

00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:33.180
know the looping the loopy loop

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.599
um another way to put it is

00:46:36.599 --> 00:46:39.060
this is where the Precision in our in

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.460
our course comes because it's a very

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.140
sophisticated question and if we

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.819
couldn't make distinctions how could I

00:46:44.819 --> 00:46:47.640
possibly answer it right but another way

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.500
to think about it is that like other

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.780
animals we can simulate our environments

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.640
and we can simulate hypothetical

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.380
environments

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.380
but unlike what other animals we

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.020
simulate ourselves right

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.700
and so

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.520
a lot of times when we're dancing what

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.859
we're actually we're simulating oh this

00:47:07.859 --> 00:47:09.720
is what I must look like to other people

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.900
right we have a we're running we're

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.119
simultaneously running a simulation of

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:16.920
ourselves

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.619
and that's the that's the kind of

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:21.720
simulation is what I would call the mind

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.720
that I Want to Be Free of and the same

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.420
with think speaking we're not it's just

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.060
not a first order we're on participating

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.319
with you

00:47:31.319 --> 00:47:33.960
I'm running it simultaneously running a

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.000
simulation of what are we saying who's

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.180
winning what is where is this going

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.920
that's and it's the same with dancing

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.540
the same kind of simulation you're

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.099
running because you wonder what you must

00:47:44.099 --> 00:47:46.680
look like and you know

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.260
um so that that would be what I want to

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.079
be entirely for you so those are I

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:55.319
hadn't actually uh unpacked it before

00:47:55.319 --> 00:47:58.020
but that's I would say that's the gist

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.260
of it

00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:07.640
okay so I want to say something

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.200
this morning

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:14.339
I was playing with arousal

00:48:14.339 --> 00:48:18.500
and justification systems

00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:21.599
and else I really want to see if I can

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:24.079
get this

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.339
um

00:48:26.339 --> 00:48:29.460
because our arousal

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.280
is contained

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.980
it gets trained

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.960
to live inside of our justification

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.440
systems

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.480
and

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.660
um

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.720
what is it like

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:56.599
to enter into the arousal

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:02.339
in a way that aware

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:06.060
oh I love I love what um Marie had said

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.940
she got from one of the last of the last

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:14.420
series of when we're aware of awareness

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.160
where does that awareness be aware of

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.140
awareness live

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.480
and I wasn't there but I got the answer

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.079
from Marie the body and I'm like oh yeah

00:49:25.079 --> 00:49:28.740
so but anyways so

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.760
if I can be aware of

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.380
my justification system

00:49:38.819 --> 00:49:43.380
and the arousal as it is captivated

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.740
by the justification system

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.460
and if I can in that new level of

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.000
awareness

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.819
Maybe

00:49:56.819 --> 00:50:01.880
let the arousal go

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.500
let the arousal

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.280
become unshaped

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:18.599
and maybe in that maybe the

00:50:18.599 --> 00:50:21.859
justification system

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.720
can

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.460
dismantle a little bit

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.980
and then

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.180
what is

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:42.319
what what how is the arousal alive

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:58.619
I don't know if I can

00:50:58.619 --> 00:51:01.640
bring it here

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.140
but

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:16.460
it feels like the arousal

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.599
is Grace

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:24.619
and that

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:30.300
if I can

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.619
um

00:51:31.619 --> 00:51:34.280
soften

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.520
and something

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.619
and let the arousal

00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:49.579
foreign

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.680
and also move through

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.680
unloading

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.780
I'm noticing myself feeling

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.780
self-conscious

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.000
and um

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:50.760
I want to speak to the intimate

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.760
relationality

00:52:54.359 --> 00:52:57.380
of arousal

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.640
and so maybe what

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.480
maybe it's hard here to take this

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.160
further

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:25.160
um

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.119
because of that because there's

00:53:30.119 --> 00:53:33.720
the need in order for that arousal

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.079
to

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.480
flow

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.280
there needs to be a

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.960
um

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.940
a way in which we're like Grace said

00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.480
available to the love

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:03.020
together

00:54:30.599 --> 00:54:36.079
and I think also there's an element of

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:43.339
arousal that yearns for touch

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.460
that yearns to come close

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.760
my arousal yearns

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.220
to

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:59.599
to be an Embrace or in them together

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:09.619
like and and sweet

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.520
um

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.859
communion

00:55:16.859 --> 00:55:20.000
or a sweet

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.760
um

00:55:24.319 --> 00:55:26.640
sharing or or

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.819
touching with you

00:55:29.819 --> 00:55:33.300
and with aliveness as it is

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.200
as it is

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.980
um

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.640
forming itself in you

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.719
[Music]

00:55:47.099 --> 00:55:50.819
so there's a a way in which

00:55:50.819 --> 00:55:52.500
when we

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.359
are coming close to each other

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.559
um

00:56:01.559 --> 00:56:03.720
I have an opportunity

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:08.420
not maybe to have my arousal

00:56:09.079 --> 00:56:13.380
defined by my justification system

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:16.260
and go jerk off someplace

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.720
you know or be in or be in my own jerk

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.720
off so to speak but to have my arousal

00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:27.920
be um

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.339
sweetened

00:56:37.559 --> 00:56:41.119
by coming close to Europe

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.520
sweetened and

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.640
um

00:56:47.579 --> 00:56:50.839
and also

00:56:50.839 --> 00:56:53.940
invited or welcomed

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.500
into a

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.420
into

00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.160
more

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.839
in me

00:57:00.839 --> 00:57:04.140
because of you being there

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.359
being you

00:57:06.359 --> 00:57:08.760
so this

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.460
beautiful mutuality

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.460
that

00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:26.520
in which I get to love more than I ever

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:29.359
loved before

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.940
I think that's good foreign

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.500
Bonita could you

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:18.000
um people to the extemporaneous

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.780
um yeah so if you know when I think it

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.359
was eyeball he had this great

01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:33.079
personal

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:37.500
uh definition of extemporaneous

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.920
um that um

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.280
maybe he can share which which I really

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.059
like his interpretation of it but for me

01:00:48.059 --> 01:00:52.200
uh for him it was like extemporaneous

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.540
kind of like outside of time or

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.640
something for me it was just that word

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:59.099
you know when they say oh he got up and

01:00:59.099 --> 01:01:01.740
he did the whole speech extemporaneously

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.839
it just means he didn't have a script he

01:01:03.839 --> 01:01:06.299
didn't have even a mental script in his

01:01:06.299 --> 01:01:10.319
head he didn't have it written down

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:12.180
um and

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:18.240
um and that is kind of like dancing you

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.020
know speaking without your your entirely

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.599
free of your mind is a little bit like

01:01:24.599 --> 01:01:25.740
that

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:28.339
um but it's at the end of my chapter on

01:01:28.339 --> 01:01:30.960
dispatches from A Time In Between Worlds

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.700
because we're forced to speak

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.839
extemporaneously because we can't use

01:01:36.839 --> 01:01:40.319
the old systems we don't know the so we

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:43.020
have to make it up as we go along

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.000
um so this is who we are the people

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.920
assembled at the end of the the old

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.640
world is we're extemporary aliens you

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.440
know so

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.440
um

01:01:54.839 --> 01:01:57.599
so that's kind of kind of what I I meant

01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:00.480
you know I wrote that in the in the

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.160
chapter meta modern chapter that came

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.200
out last year the year before

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.599
but it was from an article I wrote in I

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:11.160
think 2010 uh called uh Doom to Parish

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.420
destined to rise again uh

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.520
if you if you Google that you can see

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.040
the little article that's stored on the

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.140
internet somewhere

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.819
um and at the end I said who are we

01:02:23.819 --> 01:02:25.680
these people assembled at the end of the

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.500
world we are at the extemporary in

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.660
Aliens so

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.680
I've had that that that

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.339
image or that phrase

01:02:38.339 --> 01:02:42.740
that Mantra since for quite a while

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:46.799
thank you I am

01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:49.520
all right

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:52.680
I want to add some things

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.720
perhaps a little dark

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:59.460
but I think Evo will remember there was

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.420
a share

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.700
in one of the

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:05.099
calls with

01:03:05.099 --> 01:03:08.520
um Ukraine that has

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.520
really been with me sitting on my

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.760
shoulder very different Grace

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.079
um

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:19.380
since where this woman I don't remember

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.480
her name

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.540
but she started out by saying you know

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.520
what I'm gonna say could be

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.540
misunderstood but I just I'm I'm just

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.640
gonna risk it I'm just gonna say it

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.280
because I have to and she said

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.440
before the invasion

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.440
we were all to each other

01:03:45.299 --> 01:03:47.520
and

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.559
you know it's not like she went into

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:51.720
details

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.839
but I think everybody understood what

01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:56.819
she was talking about

01:03:56.819 --> 01:04:01.260
and um and then she said but since I've

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.640
seen

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.440
a level of cooperation that I

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.579
didn't even know existed

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:16.020
and skipping to the end she said in

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.559
these words

01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:22.200
I'm not advocating for an invasion I'm

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.579
saying do whatever the you have to

01:04:26.579 --> 01:04:27.660
do

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.400
to access

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.299
that level of cooperation

01:04:33.299 --> 01:04:35.220
that I can tell you

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.079
is

01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:40.099
is with us

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.880
and

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.980
to me this work and and other work I

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:49.200
feel I've been trying to do as an

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.900
extemporane in

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.640
it I feel like

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.359
you know just trying to dig gracefully

01:04:57.359 --> 01:05:00.299
um has so much to do with that

01:05:00.299 --> 01:05:03.960
um without obviously falling in to the

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.640
pitfalls and

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.780
malware of you know monocultures and

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:13.619
isms and ideology and all that and I

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:17.339
think this mind back and body body back

01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:18.839
in nature

01:05:18.839 --> 01:05:22.799
old tremendous Force

01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:26.780
in having us

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.960
perhaps get a glimpse of what it would

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.440
be like

01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:38.359
to access that level of cooperation

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:53.000
I wonder if Evo could

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.660
you imagine yeah I missed the letter

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.720
part of your question like somehow

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.040
um you muted yourself

01:06:10.619 --> 01:06:13.619
no I mean I just know you followed this

01:06:13.619 --> 01:06:16.140
very very closely and very intimately

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:19.099
and

01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:21.380
um

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.880
how maybe between your

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.880
these two spaces you could perhaps

01:06:32.099 --> 01:06:33.180
um

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.380
offer something

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.380
yeah thanks uh let's see what bubbles up

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.180
well first of all it's good to be kind

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.400
of back here it's been a while uh I

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.740
haven't had a lot of chance to join and

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.480
um

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.220
you know it's it feels good to just

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:01.740
admit immediately

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.640
um

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.819
tap into the field like it is some kind

01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:07.319
of like sense that we don't really

01:07:07.319 --> 01:07:09.780
acknowledge much I think

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.480
um to be able to kind of jump in and out

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.680
of spaces

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.440
and immediately feel a sense of home or

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:19.260
or or belonging but even more than that

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:20.880
like

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.180
like a certain

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.440
um

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.020
direction of travel so that's that's

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.640
really

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.960
um

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.900
yeah beautiful to to to see and thanks

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.880
thanks Bonnie for

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.740
holding that

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.880
um

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.500
and it was through her that I learned

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:45.359
this term extemporaneous and uh so often

01:07:45.359 --> 01:07:47.960
I completely

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:50.819
misinterpreted but rightly appropriated

01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:52.020
it

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.260
um you know so like properly in the in

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.599
in the vein of like speculative uh

01:07:57.599 --> 01:07:59.280
realism Maybe

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.680
but

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.520
um um yeah I think about time a lot and

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.680
usually it's like you know one moment to

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.200
the next and it follows it's sequential

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.700
and uh

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.740
I interpreted extemporaneous as

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.400
something like

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.739
taking yourself outside of the time

01:08:19.739 --> 01:08:23.480
stream and um

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:26.400
and and coming to insights knowledge

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:30.420
almost in a manner of mining

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:34.020
um and then resurfacing at sometimes

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.660
resurfacing to to have a look maybe in

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.219
the future

01:08:38.219 --> 01:08:39.540
um

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:41.940
take things from the past with you and

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:44.819
place them ahead

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:48.060
um it was inspired by what the Tibetan

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:50.160
sometimes called turmer teachings you

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.660
know they have teachings that are not

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:54.299
produced just to meet the needs of the

01:08:54.299 --> 01:08:56.520
present moment and meet the needs uh

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.859
meet the need of uh you know students in

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:01.620
in the present moment but they're kind

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:06.299
of put out there for future humans to

01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:09.839
find so they are tuned and appropriate

01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:12.900
for the Times ahead and

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.239
um you know this school here while we

01:09:15.239 --> 01:09:17.580
are here I often sense it like that is

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:18.660
what we're doing

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:21.779
it's uh it's it's ahead of its time in

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:24.120
many ways right like

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.960
and then

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.600
yeah so it's it's leaving like uh the

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.460
breadcrumbs behind

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.560
um let's say so for others to find so

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.540
they can find their ways and so that's

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.880
how I interpreted extemporaneous and

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.040
it's not just like a term or

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.719
characterization but actually an actual

01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:43.679
skill

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.660
to

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:48.839
maybe be you know the embodiment of a

01:09:48.839 --> 01:09:50.819
wormhole sometimes and just create these

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.080
Loops maybe you've seen these images

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.719
where you were spaced on curves right

01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:56.460
and there's like a shortcut and you can

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:58.980
just jump to another part of it go

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.260
through the go through the donut hole

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.460
let's say

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.360
so that's how I I interpret

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.580
um yeah extemporaneity it's a

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.719
being being fluid in that and um

01:10:15.719 --> 01:10:17.580
and I mean I don't wanna

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.460
I mean since we're speaking of malware I

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.620
don't want to characterize like the

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:25.320
linear uh experience that we have of

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.120
time that we live past present future

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.400
and the now seems to move along right

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.760
and we have memories and and the past is

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.560
like what what what has crystallized

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.860
into uh the real let's say and the

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:40.500
future hasn't happened yet and uh

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.199
but the

01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:45.320
um

01:10:45.739 --> 01:10:49.140
but yeah what is considered

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.320
you know right action Right View

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.460
everything right for the Buddha

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.800
characterizes right there's many of them

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.219
you know of today is the malware of the

01:10:59.219 --> 01:11:02.040
future in some sense right so

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.719
I think it's always good to keep that in

01:11:03.719 --> 01:11:04.860
mind

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.980
um

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:12.020
and yeah so

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.120
yeah I think I'll just leave it at that

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.520
I've I've much more more words are

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.760
coming like in this uh

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.800
it's it's a it's it's a really rich

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.580
inquiry I think to just kind of tweet

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:32.570
tweak with the experience of time and

01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.940
[Music]

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.940
um

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.860
to reappreciate the present moment

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.239
in that way

01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:44.580
and also just explore the the

01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:48.960
possibilities that that are ahead and um

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.239
yeah I also just want to make like a

01:11:51.239 --> 01:11:53.580
real

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.739
appreciation of the malware let's say

01:11:55.739 --> 01:11:58.140
you know what's used as well I keep I

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.600
still keep my old blackberry and I keep

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.780
my old iPhone 5 and I'm I've got an

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.540
iPhone 10 right now and uh you know it's

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.420
it's I'm ready to retire it but they

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.520
also tell a story there they give like a

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.560
sense of direction the the the lift

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.040
breadcrumbs let's say and

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.360
who knows where we're going you know the

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.780
breadcrumbs are now made by AI the

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:25.140
or engaging with them we eat them and uh

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.540
so yeah I'm just kind of wondering like

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.280
what some sort of

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.219
Trail is being spun out but I do think

01:12:32.219 --> 01:12:34.500
that as humans we have like a specific

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.480
kind of responsibility to become these

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.640
extemporarians and to

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.920
you know learn how to put the Periscope

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.480
up in different

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.239
you know uh points in the space-time

01:12:45.239 --> 01:12:46.679
metric and Beyond actually because

01:12:46.679 --> 01:12:48.600
that's that's what it's really about and

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.780
to to Source pieces of uh understanding

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.540
and knowledge and uh and have a duty to

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.340
communicate like as happens in schools

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:58.980
right like this school so

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:02.219
so yeah uh thanks thanks for sharing and

01:13:02.219 --> 01:13:04.739
sorry to not have been a real part of of

01:13:04.739 --> 01:13:08.820
this for the journey but uh just just uh

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.800
like right now I'm an extemporanean not

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.900
having been here and now I am here so

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.960
it's it's that so you know pop them up

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.420
in spaces like this is being just that

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.040
I'm practicing just that and getting a

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.840
quick felt sense of it so it's it's

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.300
practicing a certain kind of

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.699
sense that we don't usually acknowledge

01:13:26.699 --> 01:13:30.800
as a sense it's um

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.719
yeah it's really it's really really cool

01:13:33.719 --> 01:13:35.000
so

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.620
thanks for uh inviting me to speak

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:46.640
no one

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:08.179
we've all become little rays

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.340
so just a couple of notes that you know

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:24.540
I took

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:25.920
um

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.699
what they mean when Phoebe was being

01:16:28.699 --> 01:16:31.320
extemporaneous there

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.380
um

01:16:34.199 --> 01:16:36.360
it was kind of like she was asking the

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.340
question and answering at the same time

01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.219
in a beautiful way and that is

01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:43.140
what happens when

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.380
my naive arousal bumps into the

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.340
justification system right I mean like

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.840
um

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.760
of course this is the question every

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:56.400
teenager has to answer when they just

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.780
wanna

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.960
 everything and drive their

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.580
motorcycle down the road and then they

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.380
notice that there's this justification

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.219
system that is in place or

01:17:08.219 --> 01:17:08.940
um

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.880
and uh so that's an interesting question

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.760
because what what she was answering also

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.500
it's not that

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.760
we're just saying

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:26.120
that that's not a real

01:17:27.659 --> 01:17:29.460
event

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:32.120
but

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.340
um

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.920
but then I I think that

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.900
um

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.820
uh

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.060
it's this notion of you know the

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.460
difference between flux and flow right

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.400
and that's kind of like uh when we first

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.260
start with a dispositional state we're

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:53.820
trying we're trying to have a

01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:56.460
dispositional state that allows the

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:58.860
Iran's and states to come and go and

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:04.920
shift and flux and so you could be like

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.860
have all this energy and then it's like

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.840
not socially acceptable or something now

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.820
you've bumped into this thing if you're

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.460
not aware of the justification systems

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.500
in the social norms something else will

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.900
happen right but as soon as you're aware

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.940
of it and then you're and then you're

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.580
like now your arousal energy has to flux

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.739
and now what is it oh

01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:28.620
this is interesting and when she was

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.659
describing

01:18:30.659 --> 01:18:32.820
being aware of the justification system

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.980
and the arousal energy at the same time

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:37.320
well that's what we call reflexive

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.800
awareness right because you're not just

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.219
aware of your arousal and then let it do

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:47.000
you know so it's this

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.880
comprehensive being with what is

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.679
um and then noticing

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.199
is the justification system living in my

01:18:58.199 --> 01:19:01.620
head or is there someone standing across

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:04.260
from me that

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:07.040
um you know

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.140
is being aroused being angry because

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:12.179
they're they're inside a justification

01:19:12.179 --> 01:19:14.520
system that I'm not inside of but all

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.600
these things

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.540
are part of real human experience so yes

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.620
we're not saying

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:27.440
we should be untrained pets

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.219
um

01:19:29.219 --> 01:19:32.880
but notice that

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.040
when I bump up into the justification

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.400
system the arousal energy changes

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.920
what's my dispositional state with that

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.679
so that's interesting why is it like

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:45.960
that

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.840
um what's more useful here

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.600
what's the message in it

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.719
um

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.520
can I shift it can it be distorted can

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.679
it be dissolved or do I have to or do I

01:20:04.679 --> 01:20:06.719
need to do something with my body that's

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:09.780
not distorting things or in that

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.560
direction so

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.580
these are all interesting questions

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.600
take yeah just take different modules

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.600
and say how do they relate go ahead yep

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.980
um she raised her finger

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.219
okay so uh David and I were

01:20:38.219 --> 01:20:40.739
watching a uh

01:20:40.739 --> 01:20:42.659
an interview last night and the

01:20:42.659 --> 01:20:44.699
interviewer

01:20:44.699 --> 01:20:47.120
spoke for half of the time but no the

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.500
introducer and the questioner of the

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.460
interview

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.360
spoke for half the time and and then the

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.300
second half the person being interviewed

01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.500
spoke

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.920
and in his speech

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.679
some intense this was a rabbi and some

01:21:04.679 --> 01:21:06.420
intense Venom

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:09.260
came someone from the audience just

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:12.440
yelled that's not true in this intense

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:15.960
Venom came into the space

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.340
and

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:19.380
um and he as

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:22.920
as a the convener and as the Director of

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.820
the space

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.760
basically said be quiet and I need to

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.140
say what I'm going to say and we've got

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.239
an agenda and let's keep going and then

01:21:30.239 --> 01:21:33.719
later on somebody came in with this

01:21:33.719 --> 01:21:37.980
intense uh Beauty who was so grateful to

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.260
the speaker and just I have to tell you

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.380
I'm so thank you so much and it was it

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.880
was an equal

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:47.880
um sort of invasion of the space

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.840
and so what what I was thinking and both

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.340
times he said you know he said to the

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.560
second guy listen if you if you shut up

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.780
I'll give you the first opportunity to

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.880
ask a question afterwards but right now

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.320
be quiet

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.320
and I thought well

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.440
here's this space and this person had

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.179
spoken with tremendous passion and

01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:12.000
energy and it had kind of evoked these

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.460
intense responses which are it was a

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:16.620
cultural issue and those responses were

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.020
in the culture right now this polarity

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.520
stuff

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.400
and I was wondering what if he could

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.540
have

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.000
so those are both arousal things

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.560
that have

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.040
you know been aroused by the context and

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.080
are

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:36.960
invading the space as they are and what

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.580
would it be like and this is in response

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.920
to what you'd said Bonnie about I can't

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.360
remember exactly how you said it but

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.440
like

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:44.280
um

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.199
what do we do

01:22:46.199 --> 01:22:49.320
and and is there a way of

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.500
noticing our arousal and dancing with it

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.300
differently and I was wondering what

01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.239
would it be like as the convener of the

01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:59.400
space

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:03.000
if um this Rabbi when the first negative

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.520
thinking crashing in like

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.120
had just said whoa whoa that was intense

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:14.159
whoa and then just just asked everybody

01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:16.980
let's thank you thank you for bringing

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.820
that in and let's all be with this

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:23.100
energy that came in that's part of our

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:27.800
culture right now and um

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.400
and so my question is

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.719
could we

01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:36.980
as a collective

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.460
uh

01:23:41.219 --> 01:23:44.159
hold the arousal in its in a way

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:46.320
inappropriateness or its limited-ness

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:50.159
its reactivity whatever it is

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:54.719
and and hold a space that um

01:23:54.719 --> 01:23:57.540
allows it to

01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.640
be as it is

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:01.679
exactly as it is

01:24:01.679 --> 01:24:03.840
and then

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:05.900
um

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.580
to flux

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.640
to go from flow to flux

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.440
because of a welcoming

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:20.040
so of both energies and and could what

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.219
would happen in that group

01:24:23.219 --> 01:24:26.340
if it could have

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.860
um held and not just stayed in the

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:31.080
intention of the interviewer to hold

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:32.940
this interview and hold this content

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.679
that's pre predetermined and this is

01:24:34.679 --> 01:24:38.640
what we want to talk about but to to you

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.739
know if he could have held a space for

01:24:40.739 --> 01:24:42.239
well this may be what I want to talk

01:24:42.239 --> 01:24:44.640
about but holy moly there's a lot here

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.120
that wants to be included you know so

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.179
um

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.140
and could we together

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:59.100
invite arousal

01:24:59.699 --> 01:25:01.679
to

01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:06.140
to dance in new ways together

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:44.480
and I think what I would like to add is

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:48.120
my arousal

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.800
wants to play

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.580
with that

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.420
my arousal wants to

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.600
um

01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:05.280
be personalized

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.880
me

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:11.000
in the moment

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.699
so so that I can be accommodate and I

01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:22.560
can welcome

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:26.060
without reactivity

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:28.159
um

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:33.120
but kind of in respect

01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:35.760
to

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.400
the energy behind

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.900
the anger

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:42.420
or the energy behind the Gratitude

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:45.360
that's that's coming through

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.260
for all of us

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.239
today's pick on Ray did

01:27:11.239 --> 01:27:13.800
so at that time when I was telling them

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.860
you don't talk we were involved in those

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:19.679
three years of experience in Collective

01:27:19.679 --> 01:27:21.780
Insight practice and that was what we

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.920
did we

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.900
really worked on

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.900
allowing

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:34.500
not to get hung up on what people were

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:38.040
saying but to really be able to witness

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.860
not witness that seems too detached but

01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:44.060
to experience

01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:48.360
uh the Wild and chaotic sometimes

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.260
interplay of arousal Energies

01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:54.260
um

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.860
but there's a certain

01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:03.320
what I learned is from that experiment

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:06.560
um

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.940
there's two sides of the coin one is

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:12.840
doing what you said being able to like

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.360
be completely

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.280
yelled at and

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.580
not having it phase you and over time

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:26.520
teaching that Consciousness course was

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:29.159
really good for that I'd be going along

01:28:29.159 --> 01:28:30.960
and all of a sudden someone would just

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.820
like

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:35.219
whatever they were saying and I would

01:28:35.219 --> 01:28:37.380
just

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:40.080
say things like wow where'd that come

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.699
from do you feel better now and people

01:28:41.699 --> 01:28:43.679
would laugh yeah they did just noticing

01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:45.540
that there was something that triggered

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:46.380
and

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.800
and not to shame them or whatever like

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.159
some and but that's easier because I

01:28:53.159 --> 01:28:55.020
there's asymmetric power in the

01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.040
classroom

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.400
when you're in a peer-to-peer

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.239
um

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:02.040
it's harder

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.440
and

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.620
um so one is to allow

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.620
something that in normal situations you

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:12.900
would be defensive about

01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:14.699
uh

01:29:14.699 --> 01:29:18.060
to come at you let's say sometimes it's

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.500
not even about you so you have to be

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.860
careful not to suck

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:27.420
the the Venom into your own uh uh

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:30.300
suspicious part you know so sometimes

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.219
it's very clearly someone's shouting at

01:29:32.219 --> 01:29:35.460
you and they mean you so uh that's one

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:39.719
thing but another thing is at us another

01:29:39.719 --> 01:29:42.239
level so that's the first step but at

01:29:42.239 --> 01:29:45.179
another level is

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.760
and if you talk to re about this is

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.820
something she knows about me is

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.679
so you're doing Collective presencing

01:29:52.679 --> 01:29:55.620
and you check once you check twice

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.860
you notice that there's a lot of arousal

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.500
energy but people are doing Collective

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.480
presencing so they're sitting there

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.179
being nice

01:30:05.179 --> 01:30:09.719
so and for me it's like so I feel the

01:30:09.719 --> 01:30:11.699
arousal energy too I'm just gonna let it

01:30:11.699 --> 01:30:14.159
 say and for me it's kind of

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:17.219
embarrassing because she's teaching how

01:30:17.219 --> 01:30:19.199
to be like balanced and this and that

01:30:19.199 --> 01:30:20.940
and I'm the teacher of the class when

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.699
she used to come through and and and

01:30:23.699 --> 01:30:25.500
from a certain perspective this is like

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.000
well body doesn't know how to do

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.920
Collective presence in because she

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.600
didn't pick up the stick she didn't take

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.770
her turn she just went wow

01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:34.580
[Music]

01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:37.739
but usually what happens in those

01:30:37.739 --> 01:30:40.320
situations is then the two people that

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:42.719
are mad they start yelling at me and

01:30:42.719 --> 01:30:45.780
then someone in someone then connects

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.840
with them and the energy is dissolved so

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.900
you become the fuse in the grounding of

01:30:51.900 --> 01:30:54.659
what is happening there and it's not

01:30:54.659 --> 01:30:57.000
inauthentic because you are also

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.020
triggered too so but here's the thing

01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:02.820
having said that

01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:05.639
this work will kill you because you have

01:31:05.639 --> 01:31:09.000
to have extremely high capacity the

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.100
whole group has to have extremely high

01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:13.260
capacity

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:15.840
so

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.820
of course this is what the kids are

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.159
trying to work out by doing all these

01:31:20.159 --> 01:31:22.199
circling things over and over and over

01:31:22.199 --> 01:31:23.880
again but

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:27.540
um but one of the things is is you know

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:29.340
from my perspective the way I like to

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:31.800
design it it's not rigorous enough it's

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.199
not precise enough the way that it needs

01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:36.840
something like this school because

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:38.880
it's really

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:41.880
um so there's a term in

01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.860
when you train horses especially

01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.139
stallion is this term you can get over

01:31:46.139 --> 01:31:49.380
faced the stat you just don't have the

01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:51.420
capacity to work with the energy that

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.980
the stallion has

01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:55.500
and what you usually do then is resort

01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:58.320
to Technologies like bigger bits or more

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.800
whips or something like that

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.739
um and so

01:32:04.739 --> 01:32:07.620
um most people are over faced in these

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:10.560
situations and we don't know how yeah I

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.159
have not met anyone who's good at this

01:32:13.159 --> 01:32:16.460
it always looks

01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:19.320
dis deviant

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:21.179
um and then you can come back the next

01:32:21.179 --> 01:32:24.360
day you can like compare notes

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:29.219
um and I you know I I had and so we have

01:32:29.219 --> 01:32:32.699
to be careful because if we uh if we are

01:32:32.699 --> 01:32:35.940
ideological about doing this

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.940
um you're going to get a reality check

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.699
really fast because we as human beings

01:32:41.699 --> 01:32:43.560
are not capable

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.080
of doing this certainly not in large

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.360
scale or on mass

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:52.380
um and what we're just starting to do is

01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:54.960
build a pedagogy or methodology I

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.520
consider this my work so that we can

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:02.340
um get from here to there and you notice

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.840
how the pop-up school started people

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.520
don't even know what embodiment means

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.360
they don't even know what they're

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.060
talking about they'll say guys not in

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:12.900
bodied in some woman who's a narrative

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.940
fantasy about her own psychic projection

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.699
is embodied and so you get people

01:33:17.699 --> 01:33:20.460
together and now this stuff is happening

01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:23.040
and they they're fighting about stuff

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:25.620
that there's not enough Precision uh

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.780
with so

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:30.239
so yes I think

01:33:30.239 --> 01:33:31.560
um it's it's part of the human

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:35.100
trajectory but I think that

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.300
um

01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:39.420
it's a big ask out of the human system

01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:41.219
right now

01:33:41.219 --> 01:33:43.400
um

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:46.260
then when you think of the arousal

01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.420
energy at the collective level like why

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:52.679
is Russia and Ukraine at War you just if

01:33:52.679 --> 01:33:54.480
you you sit in with five people you

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:56.580
can't deal with the arousal energy of

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:59.340
strangers that never even punched each

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:00.719
other

01:34:00.719 --> 01:34:02.699
and then you've got

01:34:02.699 --> 01:34:05.760
years and years of history and ideology

01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:08.880
across the boundary uh and you wonder

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.300
why people go to war it seems quite

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:14.520
obvious if people can't do what you're

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.080
saying

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.560
um but it seems quite obvious to me that

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.699
we're far far far away from the

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:24.900
ideologies that some

01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.820
some of these

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:29.280
communities think is just around the

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.580
corner

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.159
yeah thanks for saying that Bonnie

01:34:38.159 --> 01:34:39.900
because you know I think we put like

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.699
really people that are engaged in these

01:34:41.699 --> 01:34:43.320
practices are putting really high

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:45.540
standards upon themselves to be able to

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:46.820
do this

01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:49.980
and usually the conversation you know

01:34:49.980 --> 01:34:52.620
like the the Salient landscape kind of

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.260
the the spectrum is conflict on one end

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:57.120
and Harmony on the other right and and

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:59.159
we move between these things and because

01:34:59.159 --> 01:35:00.659
we're all supposed to be nice and

01:35:00.659 --> 01:35:03.000
collaborate and uh you know there's

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.980
there's climate change to solve and if

01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:06.780
we don't really manage to get our act

01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:08.760
together together you know and work

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.580
toward trauma and Shadow and projection

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:15.360
and blah blah blah blah blah then

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.100
um you know we will be able to kind of

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:20.219
move towards solving these higher level

01:35:20.219 --> 01:35:22.560
goals that we you know do formulate

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:24.120
together it's really easy to kind of

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.400
agree on these things but

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:29.940
um you know the the path there in some

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:32.340
sense is just

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:35.159
um incongruent you know or methods that

01:35:35.159 --> 01:35:37.440
we design our our social structures that

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:40.080
we kind of like envisioned even through

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:44.100
our imagination are so incongruent or or

01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:47.460
uh non-isomorphic with this Relentless

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.100
unfolding of reality that is happening

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:53.760
anyway right the only time where you

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:56.940
sometimes really feel what is going on

01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:59.940
real time and by this I include the

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.780
divisions of yourselves the you know the

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:06.060
biochemistry kind of unfolding and

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:08.280
happening

01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:11.159
um you know harnessing that

01:36:11.159 --> 01:36:15.000
like that level of awareness is

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.179
completely incompatible with

01:36:18.179 --> 01:36:21.239
consciously working on these higher

01:36:21.239 --> 01:36:25.020
level problems that require some kind of

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.120
cognitive cognition you know like like

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.460
an abstraction

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.620
and and and and so our bodies are just

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:34.620
not not used to handling all of that

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:37.139
um I mean if you just spent time in that

01:36:37.139 --> 01:36:39.780
and just sit like with what is going on

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:43.500
this is of course why why we

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:44.219
um

01:36:44.219 --> 01:36:47.480
do Retreat sometimes but to parse that

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.780
to to to turn it into like a creativity

01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:55.199
that we share I mean the ask is just

01:36:55.199 --> 01:36:57.960
tremendous and

01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.360
um

01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:03.540
yeah I don't see it yet right I I mean

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.460
sometimes there's experiments maybe you

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.500
remember like these these videos from

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.699
the uh

01:37:08.699 --> 01:37:11.219
I guess from the 80s or watch that like

01:37:11.219 --> 01:37:13.639
uh documentary about the Osho Community

01:37:13.639 --> 01:37:16.080
right that's like when talking Flame

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.420
Wild Wild Country and maybe some of you

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:19.580
have seen it

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.040
you know these are just these immature

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.199
attempts of of trying to channel

01:37:25.199 --> 01:37:27.420
something that goes towards that it

01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:30.420
eventually is meant to give us some sort

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:33.600
of narrative about the power of love you

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.940
know that were meant to harness as a

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:38.540
society which then is a doorway into

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:42.239
solving our issues but so so far it's

01:37:42.239 --> 01:37:44.639
just been handling Dynamite I mean and

01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:45.840
coming back to this notion of

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:48.659
extemporaneity

01:37:48.659 --> 01:37:50.780
um

01:37:51.139 --> 01:37:53.940
if you place yourself outside of it the

01:37:53.940 --> 01:37:55.739
the only good thing that kind of comes

01:37:55.739 --> 01:37:58.080
out out of it is that you if you place

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:00.120
yourself out of it you get to see

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.360
Humanity for for really where it's at in

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.520
its evolutionary history you know we we

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.920
are just living and you know we're I

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.800
don't know I'm 50 years old and

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.440
we we have some sort of weird date like

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.300
from the birth of Jesus you know we have

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:20.340
this year it's 2023 but to see where

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:22.320
we're at what we're evolutionary in an

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.239
evolutionary sense are capable of you

01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:26.219
you get to see that like really clearly

01:38:26.219 --> 01:38:28.800
and we're just in our infancy you know

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:31.800
to really get a grasp of that in an

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.040
objective sense is just rare and you

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.080
know like in terms of

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.060
getting outside of self-criticism

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:41.040
outside of or you know if you see

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.440
society as our Collective superego for

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:45.239
what we're supposed to be doing and and

01:38:45.239 --> 01:38:47.639
you know these little schools and

01:38:47.639 --> 01:38:50.340
setting our goals then um

01:38:50.340 --> 01:38:53.699
I mean it's just so so hard to be

01:38:53.699 --> 01:38:56.340
objective and to give us also the

01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.639
Forgiveness that we sometimes need to be

01:38:59.639 --> 01:39:02.639
um you know that allows us to be where

01:39:02.639 --> 01:39:05.159
we are and to work it out and to up

01:39:05.159 --> 01:39:08.520
and to just shout at each other and to

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.020
um

01:39:10.020 --> 01:39:14.000
well I don't know I mean

01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:18.600
yeah I guess I guess I guess I'm

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.460
speaking to the to the size of questions

01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.280
here you know how far is the reach of a

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:25.620
question how big is a question can we

01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:28.040
can we put like a

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:31.020
can we put some sort of measure on that

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.120
as well so we can start to relate to it

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.460
as the humans that we are right instead

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:38.159
of just be having it be ideology so

01:39:38.159 --> 01:39:40.320
because ideology is a question in

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.080
Disguise can we live up to it

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.300
and

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.400
and mostly the answer is no right

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.840
because

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.960
it's a

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.800
yeah work in progress so yeah these

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.020
These are these physical technology

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.600
should be run as EXP

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.699
eriment as ideologies of course then

01:40:02.699 --> 01:40:04.679
people get so they teach them and they

01:40:04.679 --> 01:40:07.199
trademark them and then people expect

01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:09.420
them to deliver Goods that they don't

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.699
deliver and on and on but they shouldn't

01:40:11.699 --> 01:40:13.280
be RDR

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.780
ideologies nor

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:18.000
um understood as natural laws because

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.679
they don't they're

01:40:19.679 --> 01:40:22.380
they don't they don't achieve outcomes

01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:24.860
that are predicted by their own Theory

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:27.199
so uh

01:40:27.199 --> 01:40:28.980
so

01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:31.040
um

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:34.500
and what one of the things one of the

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:38.639
the how you can smell an ideology is

01:40:38.639 --> 01:40:40.679
that when people

01:40:40.679 --> 01:40:42.960
call a retreat let's say and then it

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.139
doesn't go well they blame the people

01:40:46.139 --> 01:40:48.300
they don't think there's something wrong

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.820
with the methodology or their Theory

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:54.960
they don't use the negative results to

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:58.139
say ah there's something I gotta I gotta

01:40:58.139 --> 01:40:59.760
improve what I'm doing gotta improve my

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:01.440
pedagogy I gotta improve what I'm

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.580
talking I don't know what I'm actually

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.280
doing as a facilitator

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.980
um they they blame

01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:10.380
um the group until they get five or six

01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:12.840
people that self-select and it works it

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.840
works well because

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:18.920
just by the law of

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.120
rejecting people that don't work and

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:23.219
then they don't come back and then

01:41:23.219 --> 01:41:25.500
you've got a group that's right that

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:28.320
that's learned implicitly

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:31.380
um how to function the way that they

01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:33.659
expect to function so

01:41:33.659 --> 01:41:35.219
so

01:41:35.219 --> 01:41:38.239
um all that being said you know we are a

01:41:38.239 --> 01:41:41.280
species that experiments

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.400
um we can imagine hypothetical

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.500
environments and then experiment with

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.739
them

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:50.639
um and

01:41:50.639 --> 01:41:52.260
um but

01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:55.139
the question is

01:41:55.139 --> 01:41:58.679
um when does the negative results or the

01:41:58.679 --> 01:42:02.219
lack of results then say

01:42:02.219 --> 01:42:05.159
um come back on the designer of the

01:42:05.159 --> 01:42:08.699
methodology versus

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.760
um yeah so that's that's the question

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:15.420
and one could even ask this question of

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:17.460
you know any of the

01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:20.219
the Traditions

01:42:20.219 --> 01:42:23.460
um you know three thousand years of uh

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:26.580
Western Abraham abrahamic traditions and

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.520
5 000 years of meditation they don't

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.199
have really good results

01:42:31.199 --> 01:42:35.460
let's be honest so we need to be in an

01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:39.000
experimental attitude for a long time

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.719
because we're not doing very well

01:42:42.719 --> 01:42:44.760
it's not working

01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.739
I mean we have to work with what we have

01:42:46.739 --> 01:42:48.540
but we have to have I like what you said

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:53.060
the Relentless unfolding of reality

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.540
it's not good enough

01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:00.440
it's not good enough

01:43:00.659 --> 01:43:03.380
Anna

01:43:03.659 --> 01:43:06.960
she erased her wonderful

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:08.940
last name I know it's something

01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:12.540
something abander plonk yeah something

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:15.000
something vanity plank

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.040
thanks Bonnie there's a lot of energy

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.520
here for me arising and

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.080
I have to give it an action that

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:25.340
satisfies I'm going to speak

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.100
um

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:33.119
for me there are some elements that are

01:43:33.119 --> 01:43:35.280
arising and it's how that language has

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:38.760
been constructed and especially in the

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:42.659
places where this harmony is

01:43:42.659 --> 01:43:46.320
almost being forcefully created it

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.219
becomes a force

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:51.179
that

01:43:51.179 --> 01:43:53.940
oh I'm gonna say this where the second

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.340
person perspective a lot of the times is

01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:57.540
absent

01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:02.760
so it's almost forcing a view or a not

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.820
allowing what actually is arising to be

01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:08.100
with that and speak to that

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.440
and it can be something that's totally

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.540
opposite or something that has never

01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:16.980
ever been named or voiced or been with

01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:19.199
but it's almost like

01:44:19.199 --> 01:44:22.619
a lack of trust to be with that without

01:44:22.619 --> 01:44:25.860
having to include that perspective but

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:28.980
just the allowing of being with that is

01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.199
is creating this spaciousness or this

01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:33.780
mouriness of the aloe Centric

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:37.219
and I'm very curious about

01:44:37.219 --> 01:44:40.080
about our energy signatures and about

01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.420
creating and developing these what I

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:44.580
don't know what is a healthy eye what is

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:46.800
a healthy eye I don't know but just

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:50.040
having these energy signatures that we

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.679
are and ground and be with that in our

01:44:52.679 --> 01:44:55.080
bodies and just you know just speak to

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:58.040
what is arising and therefore connect

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.920
who's there in that same space but

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.260
there's like an

01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:06.260
um

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:11.520
I always get like on high alert when

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.440
people tell me what to do or what to say

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.260
and I think off and why am I not

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:18.659
saying off you know why is that

01:45:18.659 --> 01:45:20.580
culturally not okay

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:23.219
because I do feel that I want to say

01:45:23.219 --> 01:45:26.280
 off I don't agree with that and

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.080
please don't tell me what to do or what

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.719
to say because I don't feel it but I'm

01:45:30.719 --> 01:45:33.000
happy to explain where I am and I'm

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.980
getting emotional now so ooh this is big

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:36.900
for me

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:39.960
um yeah there's a lot here that that I

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:42.119
really want to speak to and explore and

01:45:42.119 --> 01:45:45.480
play with and and I feel this is a

01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:47.340
beautiful Edge that's got so much

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:50.460
potentiality and I do feel a huge

01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:52.739
capacity here with us like you know

01:45:52.739 --> 01:45:54.659
already

01:45:54.659 --> 01:45:57.239
how do you say off and not distance

01:45:57.239 --> 01:45:59.639
the person stay in relationship this is

01:45:59.639 --> 01:46:02.280
what Phoebe was saying how do you how do

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:05.639
you do that and stay with the person I

01:46:05.639 --> 01:46:08.760
think I just have the awareness exactly

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.540
because because

01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.699
foreign

01:46:14.699 --> 01:46:17.230
your

01:46:17.230 --> 01:46:18.480
[Music]

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:20.639
you can't control how the other person

01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:23.880
reacts but you can control that you

01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:26.159
didn't you weren't trying to be out of

01:46:26.159 --> 01:46:27.900
relationship

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:30.719
you are trying to you know used to be

01:46:30.719 --> 01:46:33.719
easier like in the movies you just slap

01:46:33.719 --> 01:46:35.880
the hysterical person and you start all

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.940
over and now it's all dialogic right

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:41.219
um but that's basically what you're

01:46:41.219 --> 01:46:43.199
trying to do when you say off it's

01:46:43.199 --> 01:46:44.880
like the whole you're just trying to

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.460
reset the the you want to stay in

01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.440
relationship but

01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.560
um

01:46:55.639 --> 01:46:58.560
this this conversation is so weird

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.780
because

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:02.960
um

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:06.679
because you know I was just in Vermont

01:47:06.679 --> 01:47:10.619
at this Retreat being spoken to by a

01:47:10.619 --> 01:47:11.940
rabbi

01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:15.480
who I told to off I use the F-bomb

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.820
like six times

01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:20.820
doctors only into his speech for like 12

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:22.679
minutes I'm like you don't get

01:47:22.679 --> 01:47:25.380
to talk to me that way just stop

01:47:25.380 --> 01:47:27.060
it if you have something to say

01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:30.000
like put it into three bullets and just

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:31.679
say them and then let us talk I mean

01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:34.020
it's funny because she said Rabbi and

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.460
you said this and

01:47:37.679 --> 01:47:41.040
to his credit he we we stayed in

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.679
relationship and this was a very big

01:47:43.679 --> 01:47:47.060
deal for me to

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:50.340
uh we had a nice little conversation

01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:52.260
afterwards and then we went for a walk

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:55.020
the next day and really kind of shared

01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:57.860
uh

01:47:58.199 --> 01:48:00.960
different things that were in that NRG

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:03.179
but but

01:48:03.179 --> 01:48:04.260
um

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:07.320
so that's a very high some people were

01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:11.400
horrified and came up to me and started

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.440
accusing me of this and accusing me of

01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:16.560
that and I had to like you know get on

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.300
their page and say you know that I had

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.760
taken dotted my eyes and crossed my

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:26.040
teeth whatever some people were not at

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.020
high capacity but many people were at

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:32.280
high capacity and this Rabbi is an

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.380
energy

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:36.719
Contra person anyways

01:48:36.719 --> 01:48:38.760
um so it was all a discussion at that

01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:41.100
level but

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:42.960
um that that's those people were at high

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.639
capacity uh I would say even still I had

01:48:47.639 --> 01:48:50.159
to I went into my room and cried like a

01:48:50.159 --> 01:48:52.679
baby and it's really hard to work on it

01:48:52.679 --> 01:48:55.139
was the shame wanted to come up you know

01:48:55.139 --> 01:48:58.199
because I was with my peers so very very

01:48:58.199 --> 01:48:59.880
difficult

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:03.800
I I got in my car and played Enya

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:06.119
evangelist and danced in a medal the

01:49:06.119 --> 01:49:08.820
next morning and I was crying and that

01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:10.320
felt good and then every once in a while

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.239
it'd be I think I told this story the

01:49:12.239 --> 01:49:14.460
other day like why is it so painful to

01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:16.980
cry and that was because

01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:18.840
um

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.659
I was I because

01:49:21.659 --> 01:49:24.060
a little story would come up you know so

01:49:24.060 --> 01:49:26.699
it's very very difficult it's it's very

01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:28.980
very difficult in

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:29.580
um

01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:31.980
uh

01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.920
even when in general there's high

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:37.080
capacity and then the next day the

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.880
energy went up again in somebody else

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:41.699
who I very much admire freaked out and

01:49:41.699 --> 01:49:43.739
started screaming

01:49:43.739 --> 01:49:45.840
screaming that I don't even know where

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.320
it came from and I was like you know

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.260
like so this is what I'm saying we have

01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:54.900
to realize how

01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:56.880
uh

01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.360
yeah like emo was saying how how were

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:04.800
babies at this you know uh it's and it's

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.960
not clear whether this is something we

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.480
have to go through or because of the

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:12.840
shape of culture today is impossible is

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:13.920
just

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:16.739
foreign puts too much

01:50:16.739 --> 01:50:19.139
taxes our nervous system too much it's

01:50:19.139 --> 01:50:21.840
not clear they're probably both both

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.460
correct but

01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:24.900
um

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:27.000
yeah

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.580
things and and what it arises when you

01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:32.100
were speaking body is like if I can't

01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:34.560
say off and have my boundaries with

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:37.139
my husband then how the F or with my

01:50:37.139 --> 01:50:38.820
friends or with my children then how can

01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:41.520
I do that in society so where where

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:44.219
where's this sacred or playful

01:50:44.219 --> 01:50:46.320
playground or where is it starting I

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.900
feel that that for me is the the circles

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:51.060
the first circles and then it expands

01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:54.540
like people are shouting their ideas on

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:58.020
on Facebook if they face an energy

01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:00.420
that's pushing or resisting and then

01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:02.460
they give their comment and then that

01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:04.679
precious energy that actually can change

01:51:04.679 --> 01:51:08.100
something is gone in The Ether yeah and

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:09.960
you have to be able to take it as much

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:12.780
as give it right like there's been times

01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:15.000
where like there's so much pressure on

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.679
the other person and then they'll just

01:51:16.679 --> 01:51:19.860
like I said this other person you've got

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:22.139
it and then they're just and now it's

01:51:22.139 --> 01:51:24.860
coming your way

01:51:25.619 --> 01:51:28.679
in reality the person I told he didn't

01:51:28.679 --> 01:51:30.900
get to talk to me that way was using

01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:33.420
nice words saying nice things being

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:36.179
conceptual and he didn't get to

01:51:36.179 --> 01:51:38.100
talk to me that way and the one that was

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:41.040
screaming at me like standing this guy

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.440
and like screaming at me

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:46.560
that was that was okay and I understood

01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:49.139
what was coming that was arousal energy

01:51:49.139 --> 01:51:52.139
so

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:55.619
and I think what you're describing is we

01:51:55.619 --> 01:51:56.880
tell people the up is because

01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.040
they're being nice and it's implicit and

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:01.560
they're manipulating and this is why you

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:03.060
can get embarrassed because you look

01:52:03.060 --> 01:52:05.000
like the one that's the

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.340
especially if nobody else is they're

01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:12.239
like okay with it you know so I mean in

01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:14.159
this case there was a whole group of

01:52:14.159 --> 01:52:16.260
people that felt the same way and they

01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:21.000
understood that he that was just

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.699
getting that energy out from underneath

01:52:23.699 --> 01:52:25.619
the table but

01:52:25.619 --> 01:52:28.139
yeah so we're talking about the these

01:52:28.139 --> 01:52:29.580
are all different social psycho

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:31.619
technologies that we are interested in

01:52:31.619 --> 01:52:34.800
in uh experimenting with but there

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.260
really are experiments

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.600
um we really don't know what we're doing

01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:42.239
and

01:52:42.239 --> 01:52:45.840
even after the fact you explain it but

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.940
like at one point I was telling

01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:50.520
explaining my situation and I had to say

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.080
in the second case I'm like and then

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.480
something happened and actually I I

01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:56.400
don't even really know what happened

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.940
so much was happening at the same time

01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:03.060
um so uh we have to be careful not to

01:53:03.060 --> 01:53:05.520
narratively reconstruct it so it looks

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:08.400
like someone else's fault and not yours

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:13.199
uh which is a tendency we have because

01:53:13.199 --> 01:53:16.199
in those situations all everyone will

01:53:16.199 --> 01:53:17.639
have a different narrative because

01:53:17.639 --> 01:53:21.300
nobody really knew it's not clear what

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:22.739
actually happens the whole thing

01:53:22.739 --> 01:53:25.260
explodes

01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:27.960
uh but people will go they'll sit with

01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:29.119
their friends

01:53:29.119 --> 01:53:32.880
they'll shape a common narrative uh that

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.260
makes them look good and the other one

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:36.239
bad and this is something that we have

01:53:36.239 --> 01:53:39.000
to also uh

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.940
be careful with

01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:44.699
this is who we are this is

01:53:44.699 --> 01:53:48.440
we think we're grown up but

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:51.500
yeah thanks for saying that

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:54.119
go ahead whoever was like trying to

01:53:54.119 --> 01:53:55.100
speak

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:58.739
spoken it was just a quick comment I I

01:53:58.739 --> 01:54:00.600
was listening to Michael Lewin the other

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.619
day and he was um talking about

01:54:04.619 --> 01:54:07.139
um diversity of intelligences I mean

01:54:07.139 --> 01:54:10.440
even within your own body that we kind

01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:13.320
of overvalue you know the brain and this

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:15.900
that and the other but if we really

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:18.600
really focused on what the liver is

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:22.020
doing you know it's it's like an

01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.840
incredible intelligence that only the

01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:28.440
liver can perform I mean there's not

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:31.440
another liver there's that River doing

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:34.980
that and I think I don't know if this

01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:37.440
makes sense to anybody else but

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:40.800
in trying to stay away from

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:44.480
um these these blame or praise

01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:47.040
polarities because they work the same

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.080
way really

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:49.820
um

01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:53.900
that this this malware I could almost

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:58.320
try to describe it as as a zero-sum

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.420
mandate

01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:04.219
I mean there's kind of this learned

01:55:04.219 --> 01:55:07.440
zero-sum mandate across the board that

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.679
just affects different organisms

01:55:10.679 --> 01:55:12.980
in different ways and different

01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:16.800
intelligences in different ways and you

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:20.880
know to wean ourselves out of this

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:23.639
um mandate you know I I really don't

01:55:23.639 --> 01:55:26.400
think it's possible after a certain age

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.560
and and

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:30.420
you know I kind of went into this

01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.940
Retreat last week with this total

01:55:32.940 --> 01:55:35.580
conviction that we need to abolish High

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.139
School

01:55:37.139 --> 01:55:39.719
just a minute

01:55:39.719 --> 01:55:42.659
you know just kind of abolish High

01:55:42.659 --> 01:55:43.500
School

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.659
because that's where

01:55:45.659 --> 01:55:48.179
this Middle Passage

01:55:48.179 --> 01:55:52.500
kind of starts to really condition to

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:55.679
this zero-sum mandate and we treat it

01:55:55.679 --> 01:55:59.699
like oh it's you know something that

01:55:59.699 --> 01:56:02.639
um you have to go through in order to

01:56:02.639 --> 01:56:05.760
face the adult reality or whatever but

01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.760
that's exactly where we lose

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.900
I think access to what could be a

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:16.320
different co-evolutionary moment for a

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:19.380
species it's only 300 000 years old I

01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:22.380
mean jury's still out as to whether

01:56:22.380 --> 01:56:24.000
we're going to learn

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.119
how to be with the ecosystems that we

01:56:27.119 --> 01:56:29.460
need to

01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.860
um it's just very we're very recent with

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:35.520
the youngest species on the planet so

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:36.900
you know

01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:38.900
um

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:43.320
Amy yeah there's Factoria that are

01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:45.060
younger than us but

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:46.020
um

01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:48.199
um

01:56:48.719 --> 01:56:52.139
yeah so civilization started around 15

01:56:52.139 --> 01:56:54.780
000 years ago and all civilizations

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:56.699
they're predicated on the down

01:56:56.699 --> 01:56:59.460
regulation of arousal energy right and

01:56:59.460 --> 01:57:02.400
one with one kind of ideology or another

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:06.360
this is what Freud's point was uh

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:09.119
um so there's a trade-off uh

01:57:09.119 --> 01:57:11.460
civilization and then you have it's

01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:14.820
discontents right so

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:17.520
um so this is this is an interesting

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:20.460
question about our future

01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:22.520
um

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.300
but

01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.300
um

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.040
yeah

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.219
with this kind of conversation for

01:57:35.219 --> 01:57:38.520
example or practice

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.880
you know has has never really been done

01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.619
before

01:57:43.619 --> 01:57:46.980
and that's part of it I'm not as scary I

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:48.900
mean no yeah

01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.320
um and it's in it and it takes a lot so

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.840
I'm gonna have to run this is a great

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:57.360
conversation I mean we have whenever we

01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.159
have energy to keep going after two

01:57:59.159 --> 01:58:00.900
hours that means there's

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:04.139
it's not really depleted us

01:58:04.139 --> 01:58:06.900
um that even heard from Susan yet and I

01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:08.820
know she holds back she's trying to be

01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:11.360
like Ray

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.780
just teasing

01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:19.679
um but uh but thank you so much for a

01:58:19.679 --> 01:58:21.599
conversation and maybe David if you want

01:58:21.599 --> 01:58:23.760
to come to the next one uh we'll look at

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.800
more of the text because when you read

01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.139
that doc to me that I was very tempted

01:58:28.139 --> 01:58:31.440
to uh talk about the writing so maybe

01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:34.760
I'll use my Force Major

01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:38.780
uh to get on that page

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:41.820
I'll be back

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:43.560
thank you very much

01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:46.340
bye everyone



## Cohort 4

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.500
thank you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.100
this chorus sometimes reminds me of that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.920
movie it's like a science fiction movie

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320
not I mean a horror movie

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.300
I want to say it's 10 Little Indians but

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.039
it isn't but anyways these people they

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.900
get invited to this dinner party and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.120
then look one after another

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.700
they start to die

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.579
what was that movie

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.040
and of course every time someone dies

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.960
people are flustered because everybody

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.879
thought it was sure that that was the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.620
person that was you know they got it set

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.719
up so the person that you think is the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.120
murderer is the person that falls off

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.980
next I can't I have no idea how the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.020
movie ends or anything

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.780
but anyways it's not supposed to be more

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.940
but it's supposed to be funny

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.800
um

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.220
um but yeah so here we are I'm sure this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.439
will be some late late skis seems like

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.180
babies alive

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.520
oh baby's alive I didn't mean that

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.979
[Music]

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.860
foreign

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.780
will be the last person standing he will

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.180
be the one that knife

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.520
all right so I thought we did something

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.340
a little different today to start off

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.850
um if that's okay with you

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.159
[Music]

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.680
because it's a problem I'm torturing

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.780
myself with

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.659
um so I figured I'd try to spread the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.600
torture uh distributed you know

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.479
ecosystems

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.140
so let me just like this is a really bad

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.240
illustration

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.540
um because I I put it up on PowerPoint

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.399
you know me and when I'm trying to work

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.100
out something I have all these drawings

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.020
and fries and Rhymes trying to figure

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.360
out and then I'm like well I can't I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.680
can't show that it doesn't make any

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.720
sense and so I did this PowerPoint thing

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.479
but it's not very good like it but it's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.239
I just want to show you what is that's

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.160
kind of at stake what we're trying to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.560
formulate here right so

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.060
um

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.580
um if you don't get it then it's because

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.640
it's not it's not such a great uh great

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.120
thing okay

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.040
um and I've seen Claudia there she

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.980
sometimes and takes my stuff and then

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.379
draws these great illustrations and

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.599
Sandra sometimes takes it and draws

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
these connections so I'd be very happy

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.900
to see some improvement

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.300
on this pathetic thing I'm going to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.700
share with you live online today

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.120
distributed torture

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.260
we got the DTs here okay so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440
we're going to share this thing I'm

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.459
going to hide

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.040
Okay so

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.480
here we have

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.720
space or something you know just

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.080
space

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.900
and then into this space we have a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.120
person is in this space but the person

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.519
is a compound individual you see how the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.440
person's made up of like all these other

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.680
cells and all these these bacteria and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.680
these invasive species in some cases are

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.780
in their gut and stuff so I'll show you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.640
that again the thing is we have to

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.459
really come to terms with the fact

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.980
that we're talking about

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.860
both the single individual here which

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.540
we're calling a person

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.060
and somehow having to keep in mind

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.920
that is composed of all these other

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.500
dimensions of reality right

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.540
and each one of these little dot

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.540
dimensions of reality itself is composed

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.760
about by dot dimensions of reality does

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.080
that kind of make sense with this little

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.080
slide is just gonna thumbs up or

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.000
something okay so that's all that means

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.620
and I'll show you too once again you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.280
gotta try to come to terms with the body

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.440
as this

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.299
habitat of other bodies

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.340
okay

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.940
now

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.860
this body walks into a meadow

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.780
and experiences this this compound

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.479
individual experiences the metal is full

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.360
with flowers grasses

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.560
it doesn't experience the meadow as

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.080
a bunch of little dots right I mean this

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.940
is the ordinary we're looking at the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.580
compound individual as a bunch of dots

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.620
but the compound individual themselves

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.639
is just experiencing the metal in in

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.160
this ordinary human way

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.360
and just walking by them that are

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.400
noticing on a nice spring day it's just

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.100
a little metal walk and in the process

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.060
um

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.639
begins to

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.100
Ingress this is the word we have the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.360
habitat that's walking through begins to

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.100
be

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.300
not only something that is apprehended

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.620
by

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.620
their awareness but also somehow

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.620
that

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.720
gets trains all the other individuals

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.800
somehow got awareness gets also trained

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.220
all the other

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.500
sub-individuals get trained on to that

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.259
information also does that make sense

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.180
like

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.500
books

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.539
we're gonna have to look at him yet so

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.880
he's what first is this compound

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.000
individual walking through the metal the

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.220
fact that it can walk is because of

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.520
these compounds all these things are

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.280
acting in some kind of Unison and then

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.340
he gets this awareness Meadow at

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.440
whatever level of complexity can become

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.120
a narrative it could become a Disney

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.180
movie whatever anyways the first so so

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.699
this is the first

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.940
but it's it's not

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.940
the fact that he they that he has this

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.979
awareness is because

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:47.699
the metal is directly Ingress into

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.699
the populations that is the person so

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.400
the fact that you can have the idea of a

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.860
meadow means that the cells in your

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.680
brain are directly involved in creating

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.759
that idea

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.199
do you see what I'm saying

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.100
the Ingress actually goes directly to

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.039
which begs then the question is what is

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:12.720
the compound individual this has all

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.520
kinds of problems I told you this is a

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.220
torturous thing okay now we have uh

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.139
something else bizarre happening and

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.660
this actually very common thing and now

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.400
he's bumps into there's somebody else

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.759
walking into the meadow

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.759
and they are a compound individual and

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:33.300
now they're exchanging thought Bubbles

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.020
and stuff like that and becoming more of

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.360
a different type of com they're

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.979
constituting a different type of

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:42.780
compound individual

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.060
uh which is culture

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.520
so

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.759
I want to go back to the slide that I

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:06.599
showed in the hollow series of distilla

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:09.840
and it shows the anabra these are

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.720
Aboriginal drawings and I was trying to

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.319
show a view of reality in which

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:22.080
you have all these living centers

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.039
and they self-organize in such a way to

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:29.039
become compound individuals but they

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:31.379
also

00:08:31.379 --> 00:08:34.860
in the background their participation is

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.560
living centers at this lower layer

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.080
doesn't go away

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.320
right so when we look at the stars in

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.240
the night sky and we see a bull

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.519
the bull is

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:53.100
the Stars themselves are still there

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.339
there's a certain organization that's

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:57.720
happening

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.899
in which the beings

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:02.600
um

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.240
become causal agents at a another level

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.880
of reality another scale of reality

00:09:32.339 --> 00:09:36.720
and of course this is part of our

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.700
investigation of now how do we put the

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.899
body back into nature and one could see

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:47.279
this as the cosmic microwave background

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:50.459
which was the original pattern at the

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:53.519
beginning of the beginning so

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.779
um that's kind of the way my mind works

00:09:57.779 --> 00:09:58.920
um

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.500
and

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.940
um

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.500
yeah it's very hard to

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.959
you have to like use your mind in 10

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:13.760
Dimensions kind of like

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:16.700
thank you

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.080
all right that's all I got to say

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:35.160
obviously it's not a problem to be

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.320
solved it's a mystery to be

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.040
experienced or explored I mean how how

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.160
because then there are questions like is

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.660
there a level of

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.399
if if I

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.640
see it gets very very tricky because

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.339
again if I'm walking through the meadow

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:04.680
and I'm aware of I am walking through a

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.040
meadow

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.320
that phenomenon itself is because all

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.420
the subunits in me are also directly

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.260
interacting in the meadow which is why

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.980
I get served up

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.079
this perception that it seems to exist

00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:31.019
only at the scale of the human right so

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.060
I mean that's true it seems to exist

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.459
only at the scale of the human

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:38.339
and so what we actually have is some

00:11:38.339 --> 00:11:42.180
kind of porous direct participation

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.779
of everything across all these scales

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:50.519
and that somehow though creates

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.779
experiences that are are accessible and

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:00.420
experiences that are not accessible the

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.380
experience that maybe maybe one of my

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.019
brain cells is being attacked by you

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:10.680
know some bacteria and and somebody and

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.660
the other immune systems cleaning that

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.440
up I can't experience that from as my

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.940
experience it right and whatever happens

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.680
to the neurons

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.779
they don't experience you know they

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:26.579
don't do language oh look it's a metal

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.980
oh look it's a butterfly

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.440
um that experience at that level is not

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.899
acceptable accessible to me but the

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:36.120
point is is that the participation

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.220
itself is seamless

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.240
the kind of experience

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.480
that any agent any individual or

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.519
compound individuals have any there's

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:54.899
only a radius of accessibility

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.579
and

00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:59.300
but

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:02.700
the participation is is seamless and

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.940
direct

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:09.120
it's not like I'm walking through the

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.240
meadow I have an experience or thought

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.100
of I'm walking through the meadow and

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.860
then that thought creates downward

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.500
causation it can't be just like that

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.360
because the fact that I have a thought

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.660
is because there's cells in my brains

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.079
being individual agents themselves

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:30.000
so it's kind of a big deal what I'm

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.220
trying to say I don't know how to say I

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.740
mean it's one of these loopy things

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.200
um but

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.060
that's kind of

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.740
um

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.720
when we're not I think we did a good job

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.639
putting the Mind back into the body it's

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.680
quite easy because we just use the

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.839
animal body and see how much

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:54.420
uh some you know how familiar our our

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.300
ways are but putting the body back into

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:02.540
nature requires a kind of uh

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:05.760
a perspectival shift that is quite

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.300
complex

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.880
well I think a decent example is that

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.800
we always see a tiny part of the

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.079
electromagnetic spectrum right and yet

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.240
all of it is hitting us energetically

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.500
all of it BC more than we do right

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.680
it's what we are

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.320
enculturated and physically oriented to

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.240
focus our attention on is wear your

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.519
attention I think it was

00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.440
Meister Eckhart said something like

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.680
where you put your attention God is

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.600
you know so it's a matter of where is

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.120
your attention it's only it tends to be

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.519
in the arena in which you were trained

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:50.940
to sing but it's broad I mean I had two

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.500
children when they're newborn they're

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.360
not focused on jack they're just

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.480
like where the hell am I of course they

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.699
can't have that but you can't see where

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:03.120
they are you can see the space of them

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.860
but they're not focused

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.579
yeah so they're much more of a compound

00:15:11.579 --> 00:15:15.420
individual until then we so Michael

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.180
Levin says we're used to seeing you know

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.399
this is

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:22.620
the verbeki's notion of relevance

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.860
realization but Michael Levin says that

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.000
we're used to assigning agency

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.920
to things like us

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.980
anything that's much bigger or much

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.000
smaller much faster or much slower

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.600
we don't it's very hard for us to use

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.720
words like alive or cognitive or

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.380
intelligent agent right and

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.899
um and so I think that's kind of

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:57.779
interesting to just notice that

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:00.300
yeah those four terms anything much

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.240
bigger like the universe anything much

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.500
smaller

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.920
anything much faster like a photon or

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.260
whatever or anything much slower like a

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.680
mountain you know that actually changes

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.740
um

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.079
when we see these photographs like when

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:22.620
people speed up like the oceans it looks

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.000
like the Earth is breathing right so

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.019
anything that's

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.800
but if anything that's slow yeah so this

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.060
isn't also interesting

00:16:34.199 --> 00:16:36.240
and that being that you were talking

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.220
about is composed of all those different

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.600
particles

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.540
and that entity works with the nature

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.180
just like uh

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.880
uh when we interact with nature it tells

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.560
all those different layers but it's all

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.540
seamless seamless on both ends down

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.139
inside of us and outside of us

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:57.000
it seems to me what

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.240
nice representation inside and outside

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:05.280
what's interesting for me is it's easy

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.939
for me to assign agency to myself you

00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:10.199
know because it looks like Pond life

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:11.880
right this is the kind of thing I talk

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.540
about

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.220
but

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.640
when I think of myself as part of a

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.520
compound individual then I don't know

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.179
where to put that boundary is the whole

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:25.319
Earth

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:26.760
or

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:31.200
um like I don't think myself I mean and

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.900
and the pond and the trees here is a

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.919
compound individual

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.419
um but then sometimes I think well maybe

00:17:39.419 --> 00:17:42.720
all of humans is like this now this gets

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.780
very weird to me like moving down is

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.660
easy for me to understand

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.679
but what kinds of collections like I

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:56.039
could imagine a Galaxy being a compound

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:58.760
individual

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.220
but I don't think you can just draw any

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.620
boundary and say that's a compound

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.260
individual and so

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.940
what goes rules are so something is Auto

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.660
auto catalytic sets uh semi-permius

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.140
membrane all these things are uh all

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.660
these definitions are in but

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.700
um

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.539
yeah yeah yeah you're right

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:30.120
different out there

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.460
see the Earth and the moon could be a

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.860
compound individual and not us in the

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.220
earth it's it's impossible to to figure

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.080
out what is the actual

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.539
what did you say was the compound

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:48.960
individual out there the moon and the it

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.820
could be I'm not saying it is

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.980
right I don't know how you would know

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.539
really oh

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:58.200
um but for the Sun and the Earth

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.679
um is is even more more believable but

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:06.000
yeah so so that's that's and of course

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.860
this is tricky like is is

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.039
humanity and Ai and a real compound

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.419
individual

00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.760
I don't know

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.600
um

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.840
what are what are your criteria I don't

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.460
know that's what I'm saying it's like

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.980
it's hard to

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.919
I mean you discern can we discern

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:32.400
criteria I don't

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.980
well if we take the human as a compound

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.320
individual

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.640
um

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.320
so let's take an animal because it's

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.200
easier because we're like you know like

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.419
so I don't think all

00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:50.700
all

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.860
elephants

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.260
on the face of the Earth our compound

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.059
individual

00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:59.640
now some people argue that human

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.059
technology and language is the mechanism

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:04.380
by which

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.919
humans have are growing and then you add

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:12.660
AI are becoming a compound individual

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.380
that's what uh some people would argue

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.000
which means it would have

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.059
it would be served up awareness that's

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:27.320
inaccessible to us

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.039
so

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:32.220
you you we would be doing the serving up

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.400
uh but it would compound into an

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.380
experience

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.679
an awareness of an experience that would

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:42.660
be inaccessible to us who are doing all

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.880
the heavy heavy lifting right that's how

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.220
my cells feel I do all the heavy lifting

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.059
and then she signs the autographs

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:53.460
you know like a sports a sports

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.200
celebrity their muscles are like

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.059
complaining we do all the honey living

00:20:57.059 --> 00:20:58.919
and she's signed her name on the

00:20:58.919 --> 00:21:01.260
autograph all right yeah

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.620
something like that so it's it would be

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.460
some kind of identity formation right

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.580
um but I so

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.919
um but some people argue that yes the

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:18.000
the elephants don't have compounds now

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.780
um

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.940
that a compound individual is different

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.100
than collective intelligence like a pod

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.340
of Dolphins just like humans have

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.460
collective intelligence right we we this

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.740
distributed organs of perception and

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.840
communication

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.480
um yeah so it gets very

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.340
like like so it gets very

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.059
uh

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:52.100
I think it's very tricky

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.360
I think that's something I'm sure I've

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.760
mentioned here before but

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.559
I've been obsessed with this sort of

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:00.659
since I read it in a book um I don't

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:02.460
know eight or ten years ago that our

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.039
entire solar system goes up and down in

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:07.500
the plane of the Galaxy about every 72

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.500
million years now that's really slow but

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.140
I'm convinced that

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.760
you know we should be able to experience

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.220
that we're all in it we're all in it and

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.900
there's no escaping as long as you're on

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.400
this planet

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.840
and there's something about the

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.720
singularity and the motion and what

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.940
drives that motion that I just find

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.700
Enchanting for some reason

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.880
okay so that's actually a good something

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.720
we we can use because it suggests that

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.539
you can

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:41.520
hypothesize compound individuals by some

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.919
kind of rhythmic pattern

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:47.220
right so so

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.179
um

00:22:48.179 --> 00:22:52.280
they share some rhythmicity I would say

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.500
duration and

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.419
rhythmicity so like

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.780
you know this is this is actually very

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.240
interesting because

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.360
um

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.179
yeah so something something like that

00:23:21.179 --> 00:23:23.340
some kind of rhythmic

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.600
pattern that both changes but there's a

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.580
permanence and then there's fluctuations

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.480
right but there's some signature uh

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.860
rhythmicity

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.780
and duration

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.179
so every 72 million years right so this

00:23:42.179 --> 00:23:45.960
is the duration of its stability of its

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.580
identity or something like that that's

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.919
interesting

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:51.780
um it's actually what very close to what

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.799
white had said that

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:01.620
I was in one of the sessions a few weeks

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.799
back before the recap and we were it was

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:06.659
a common the exact question you asked

00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:07.559
Bonnie

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:10.260
um we went into breakout groups and it

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.880
was and he said the hymn was you know

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.120
putting the Mind back in the body

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.760
um and like in that we the group I was

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.919
in we kind of also went on this kind of

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.200
tangent also kind of looking into like

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.600
it feels really unformed I don't know

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.100
how to put it but something around

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.140
polarity as well

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.360
and how yeah a magnet when you you cut

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.860
it in half it doesn't become enough in

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.539
this the South piece but actually

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:36.240
there's still that polarity

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.919
on larger and smaller scales

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.900
yeah so this word is also it's important

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.740
so we're popular in our answer here but

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.960
um and it's it's it's the question of

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.960
decomposability

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.900
um so uh uh uh magnets maximally

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.059
decomposable you can keep slicing and

00:25:00.059 --> 00:25:03.200
slicing and it still is a magnet

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.620
plantaria have this too

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.020
um but then this becomes problematic

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.820
with people because

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.280
uh we're not very decomposable

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.100
um

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.460
we can replace our parts but

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.539
were were were so special we're a

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:26.340
compound individual that's got it's very

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.620
specialized

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.039
and so

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.700
it's hard to yeah so from from so

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.799
decomposability has something to do with

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:40.919
it and

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:44.659
but then

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.960
ah maybe it's the opposite Maybe

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.659
if it's maximally decomposable it's a

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:54.659
single individual

00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:56.059
I don't know

00:25:56.059 --> 00:25:58.020
decomposability has something to do with

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.520
it but I've never been able to make it

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.159
work lacrosse all

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:05.179
all cases

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.740
yeah that's interesting

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.700
the way I kind of came into that oh

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.940
no no go right ahead it's just like the

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.440
way I came into that thought in that

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.240
session was kind of I think it was

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.340
something about like uh awareness I

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.500
can't remember the exact question

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:23.279
um

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:25.080
and I was like how how do I know I'm

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.659
aware of something and the the image

00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:29.820
that came to me was like a waveform and

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.200
it's like kind of you know there's that

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.419
point in that point and that's like

00:26:33.419 --> 00:26:35.159
the Peaks and trough is kind of what

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:38.279
brought me to the the polarity idea it's

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:40.760
like that

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:44.220
yeah the range of experience

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.140
yeah I really I haven't got the words

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.460
through it like kind of I haven't been

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.900
able to put together but there's

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.360
something that feels like something

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.140
there for me yeah

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.240
so I'll

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.900
talk to the Collective

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.779
shared experience

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:07.500
um

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.860
so so as I watch the

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.940
the image of a human being that is

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.279
comprised of all of these centers of

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:22.140
being and and uh what what comes to me

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.539
is that we're a compositive shared

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:27.779
subjectivities but there's all these you

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:28.919
know

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:33.480
sources of uh action and choice inside

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.580
of us and

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.140
um and

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.039
so we come from this all this these

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:43.860
components live in the universe and then

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.900
for some reason they have

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.440
come into a centralized organization in

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.159
terms of a human and but but and maybe

00:27:53.159 --> 00:27:56.820
in the Aboriginal before modern man we

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.100
continue to

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.380
disengage from that awareness of being

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.000
part of this vast field of

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.679
subjectivities and become more and more

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:09.179
isolated from it so that we no longer

00:28:09.179 --> 00:28:11.760
identify and maybe part of then and but

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.260
becoming more and more distinct as

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.799
individuals and then now maybe and even

00:28:16.799 --> 00:28:19.679
in the images you showed that that from

00:28:19.679 --> 00:28:20.880
there

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.520
we wake up again and maybe also through

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.200
our science and through meditation

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.200
practices and we start to realize oh I

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.659
I'm not seeing the meadow because I just

00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:33.299
have a a thought that the met you know

00:28:33.299 --> 00:28:34.860
that the meta was something outside of

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.299
me but it's because there's some

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:40.580
something in me that is already a meadow

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.820
that is in relationship to Meadow

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.740
or that is Meadow in a continuous form

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:52.320
and so I was thinking like

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.500
foreign

00:28:55.919 --> 00:28:58.080
when you said what is a compound

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.539
individual and what are the criteria in

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.760
that so I thought I came I had was

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.940
shared subjectivities that are somehow

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.539
there's so there's a dance between

00:29:09.539 --> 00:29:11.520
the multi

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.980
uh

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.900
multiplicity that I am

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.260
and the organization in my own awareness

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.779
Consciousness which hopefully been

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:25.980
opens back into and participates with

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:30.059
the um the shared complexity or

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:31.380
Multiplicity

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.120
and then uh

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.120
um consciously Interactive

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.020
subjectivities

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.700
I wrote that and I don't remember what

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.880
why I wrote that but

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.500
um

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.960
So when you say you know the compound

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.260
individual that there's rhythmic

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.940
patterns

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:05.159
duration and and uh rhythmicity that's

00:30:05.159 --> 00:30:07.140
um

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.240
that's movement

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.100
and uh

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.380
effect and time and space

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.580
and aliveness

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.679
and I don't know where awareness comes

00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:24.799
in

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:30.419
but it feels like you know you know when

00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:33.240
they say when you become aware of

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:33.910
something

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:35.640
[Music]

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.100
it becomes self-aware even even

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.960
something that's not

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.880
what we think of is something that would

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.460
be self-aware but that that almost

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.860
imbuing awareness

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:51.179
onto things by recognizing their their

00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:54.080
own uh

00:30:54.179 --> 00:30:57.179
subjectivity somehow

00:30:57.179 --> 00:30:59.580
so that's a whole bunch of

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.179
um

00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:02.820
unrelated or not this dispersal

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.740
dispersed thoughts that I have that's

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.860
all I can say in the moment

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.000
good thoughts

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.340
yeah

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.840
no go ahead

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.360
I just had this thought when uh Phoebe

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.100
was talking

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.299
that

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:27.899
the mind as it we have developed it into

00:31:27.899 --> 00:31:30.360
it's not an evolutionary mistake it's

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.399
something's going on there and I just

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:34.940
wondered if

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.059
that the purpose of it is peaked in its

00:31:39.059 --> 00:31:40.860
oscillation and putting the Mind back

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.960
into the body as we're returning towards

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.220
as part of an oscillation

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.580
that's what aurobindo thought

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.340
you know his Descent of spirit

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.620
um had that overtones to

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.279
translated like that but he wasn't I

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.440
don't think he was he was this was a

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.179
whole Vision he had so it wasn't just

00:32:03.179 --> 00:32:04.980
about humans

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.140
taking

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.720
spirit and descending it it was more

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.760
like what you just said that the whole

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.940
Spirit itself has this oscillation where

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.100
it's like the it's like the lake turning

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.159
over in the winter or the summer or

00:32:19.159 --> 00:32:21.600
whenever it turns over

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.080
no yeah that's a beautiful that's a

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.399
beautiful insight

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:28.799
I'm not a um

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:30.659
or have been no

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:32.580
um expert by any means but I've read a

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.960
bunch of stuff

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.000
and the way I took some of which I

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.220
really loved basically is he basically

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.140
he says something like

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.679
matter is

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:46.440
concrete confined Joy

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.080
and that part of what we are doing is we

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.600
are reaching into the depths of that to

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.320
release the joy into its own freedom to

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.240
be enjoyed

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:59.580
and I like that isolation process of

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.700
going down into what we might call pain

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.340
find and releasing it so that it becomes

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.559
a joy that it once was before was

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:09.299
contracted and hidden

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:10.980
that's one of the

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.140
views that I took for more ability that

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.679
I still love

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.120
that takes into consideration a temporal

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.200
framework that is bigger than what we

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.700
normally think oh people are going to

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.640
die species in Europe you know I love

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.980
this that that you anything that happens

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.340
that that really macrocosmic scale I I

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.580
think we can assume has much longer

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.740
temporal Frameworks even the species

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.200
Evolution has a much longer temporal

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.019
framework and it's hard for people to

00:33:46.019 --> 00:33:48.740
to

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.159
it's hard for that to be as real for

00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:55.740
people as you know the the normal cycle

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.620
of maybe one or two generations

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.179
um but it's really this question of

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:05.460
and yet what is this larger thing

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.220
that is moving

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.859
um yeah that's that's beautiful thank

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:12.060
you

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.240
see one thing I like that

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.820
think that I'm practicing is having

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.419
these longer wavelength experiences and

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:23.220
then bringing them into the body so my

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.560
body doesn't freak out you know sort of

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.899
it's like the range from which I can

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.940
move from the longest to the shortest

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.879
and be fluid and be able to move along

00:34:32.879 --> 00:34:37.679
that Spectrum as I widen it uh seems to

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.899
be a project of mine

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:42.839
yeah but that's the point right because

00:34:42.839 --> 00:34:44.460
because when you're aware of your body

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.359
or aware of that

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.899
because you're saying fundamentally on

00:34:51.899 --> 00:34:55.139
this I feel as if I mean rationalizing

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:56.820
it doesn't work but if you get to the

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.680
point that your practice makes you feel

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.780
like fundamentally you're these long

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:07.140
Cosmic rhythms

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.480
and that feels like

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.380
your body

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.579
then you know that's that's Joy I would

00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:18.359
say

00:35:18.359 --> 00:35:19.859
because you always have this little

00:35:19.859 --> 00:35:24.060
terror right this little terror of

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.440
uh

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:28.079
little terror of confusion

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:30.240
the little house of Terror the little

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.339
terror of confusion

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:35.579
of why

00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:39.119
how can it be so meaningful

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:41.040
and so

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.520
temporal finite at the same time this is

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.920
this is a little confusion I have

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.800
noticed that my notion of feeling stable

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.140
and feeling unstable oscillates quite a

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.560
lot too

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.880
I want to bring into uh Alexander

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.800
byner's work on the bigger picture I

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.060
think it was something that you were

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.920
referring to a little bit Bonnie where

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.320
people are looking at it as one larger

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.839
entity out there this is his work on the

00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:16.020
psychedelics uh he's the co-founder of

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.579
Rebel wisdom

00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:20.220
and um I haven't read it all but I'm in

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.720
a zoom call with four other people

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.859
weekly no bi-weekly or my bi-monthly and

00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:28.140
uh one of them says he doesn't buy into

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.680
it being one big entity that we are

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.660
but it seems like minor might be

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.119
referring a little bit to that from his

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:39.060
uh psychedelic testing man it's I think

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.980
it's intense testing

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.839
uh I just wanted to throw that in

00:36:42.839 --> 00:36:44.700
because that's some of the group I think

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.680
you're referring to that looking at it

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.180
as one entity out there

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.420
and then that joy and that stimulations

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.880
out into it I mean we you know the sun

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.099
is a star the stars are out there the

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:01.940
galaxies

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.140
who knows

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.660
but it is fascinating things uh this

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.680
conversation this morning

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.359
and so I feel it in like moments of like

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:13.800
what we call like synchronicity right

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.300
where it kind of feels like you know if

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.760
you imagine that your body is constantly

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.380
synchronizing all these different like

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.760
different cells different things are

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.859
kind of moving with these larger

00:37:22.859 --> 00:37:24.599
patterns and sometimes it's like see

00:37:24.599 --> 00:37:26.940
something kind of Flow by and all these

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.980
things connect I get like a lot yeah and

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.960
like kind of while traveling also like

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.400
can I mentioned like we've had

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.920
psychedelic experiences as well but also

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.780
I find it interesting that it happens a

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.339
lot when I travel you know it's like

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:41.040
when I'm not in my usual pattern I'm

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.540
like kind of moving around meeting all

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.619
different kinds of people and kind of

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:45.180
just really going with with loads of

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.220
things rather than a like a rigid

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.720
schedule

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.300
and just like yeah so if those are those

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.460
moments where it does kind of feel like

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.480
a larger body

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.119
that's exactly how I live my life and

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:02.160
um using you know a Deepak tropical

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.619
simple destiny using intentions and

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:06.720
using the synchronicities to be guided

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.359
by but at the same time

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:09.960
um

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.200
I just lost my train of thought but uh

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.079
but yeah

00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:20.540
um anyway I like what you just said

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.800
sorry John were you were you saying no

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:30.720
not me yeah this this intention thing

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.040
um

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.980
you know I don't yeah can we use that to

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.140
help us kind of Define what and

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.820
you know the boundary of what we're

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.859
talking about but

00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:41.760
um

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.940
and maybe it's in the imaginal but

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.940
I sometimes wonder whether there is this

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.359
you know this this intentionality

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:53.880
um in the world around me

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.260
um

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.440
that well I mean at some level there

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.000
totally is I mean it feels like every

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.680
plant wants to kind of

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.460
grow and express itself and

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.040
um you know increase itself and and and

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.920
all of this and who knows what the cause

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.020
and effect is when I kind of look at it

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.540
you know so it's all interpenetrating

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.060
but you know I can't shake this this

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.040
kind of you know this this this this

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:22.200
feeling that this Attunement that that

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:27.420
that we can feel is kind of you know

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:30.839
with with an intentionality that's not

00:39:30.839 --> 00:39:32.460
just mine right

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.260
um and so I don't know how that kind of

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.240
fits with it maybe this is

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.220
you know I'm sort of taking it from a

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.500
different a different angle

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.480
um

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.780
but I'm sure I think that's reasonable

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.220
yeah you just

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.859
I mean I love it when I when I notice it

00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:51.839
um and

00:39:51.839 --> 00:39:54.000
you know and then then you know then I

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.680
think this probably isn't the imaginal

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.320
realm I don't know but then then you you

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.240
almost

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.040
you you almost

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.240
um

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.800
that the world starts kind of doing

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.140
everything

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.880
um and so then it is the intention of

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.020
the world

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.839
and not yours right uh so I don't know I

00:40:12.839 --> 00:40:14.940
mean maybe this is just the porosity of

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.280
the the boundaries that you're trying to

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.200
draw but

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.700
um Bonita

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.380
but um

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.540
and it seems that it shifts right so it

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.160
just takes a different shape depending

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.859
kind of of where you put your attention

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:31.380
and where you participate so you know

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.460
we're trying to draw a line around

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.040
something that just is moving so much

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.339
but but you know sometimes you use this

00:40:38.339 --> 00:40:41.400
kind of phrasing um Bonita which is that

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.260
we have this feeling of

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.180
well this feeling of I'm going to use

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.220
the word intentionality

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.980
seems to me because there is a something

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.900
a bigger intentionality whatever a

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.359
bigger will that we're participating

00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:01.940
with but um yeah who knows right

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.820
that's how interesting uh but I think we

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.740
have a lot of autonomy in it from our

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.440
own intentions somebody else that it

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.940
doesn't have intentions are just

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.280
following along as a sheeple

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.200
and uh

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.020
also what I was saying what I'm what I

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.119
forgot to say is that this course

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.980
bringing the Mind into the body and the

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.359
body and the nature I've been listening

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:26.220
to everyone's conversations

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.579
is a really fine-tuned things uh for me

00:41:29.579 --> 00:41:32.940
to uh utilize Synchro Destiny so much

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.339
more effectively and I don't think I

00:41:35.339 --> 00:41:38.820
would have been where I am right now uh

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.520
in my path if it had been for this

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.240
course because it simplified the

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.599
complexity of my erratic mind

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:52.859
but uh I think uh I don't know one man

00:41:52.859 --> 00:41:55.500
said on my call says uh you know we have

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.500
we can't give up totally autonomy within

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.760
this bigger picture well uh what mine or

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.740
seems to be saying is we are this one

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:06.720
big entity and so then we tend to give

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.960
up this uh individuality so

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.320
very interesting points

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.859
okay so I actually this was pinging back

00:42:16.859 --> 00:42:18.540
on to Phoebe and I couldn't remember

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.940
what it was bringing up and then I

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.460
remembered what I was trying my memory

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.640
was trying to remember for me

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.560
um and I remembered it was in this book

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.000
this notebook

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.500
so

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.099
um

00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:36.839
uh so if you imagine you know a bow tie

00:42:36.839 --> 00:42:39.300
like a bow tie okay and in the middle

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:41.700
there like imagine a dot in the middle

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.700
and then two white cones going out this

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.820
is the bow tie okay

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.480
and on this side there is

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.200
uh

00:42:55.579 --> 00:42:58.319
multiple initial States because we have

00:42:58.319 --> 00:43:01.260
to remember that all these sub agents in

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.339
US

00:43:02.339 --> 00:43:04.619
they don't just have our history but

00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:07.560
like the bacteria have an evolutionary

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.599
history that's a different branch and

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:11.839
the and the different

00:43:11.839 --> 00:43:14.460
cells have different you know so it's

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:17.220
not just the every time you

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.859
every time you pick a scale the scale of

00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:21.359
human then we see our evolutionary

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:24.540
history but if you pick the scale of

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:28.800
um the mitochondria in our cells uh it

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.700
goes way back way before and so we have

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.180
so this cone on this side is all those

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:39.119
multiple initial States

00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:42.119
the dot in the middle is me the human

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.640
the agent the compound individual but

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.359
there's this whole

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:51.000
coming together in this in this

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.760
Singularity this is what an agent is

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.920
this is singularity so you have like

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.380
these multiple initial States

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.400
even for iron let's say the thing in the

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.280
middle is just the molecule the atom the

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.780
element iron

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.240
it has to go I forget how it is you get

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.460
these initial stars and then they have

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.260
to smash into each other at certain

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.599
Heats and then the heavier elements

00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:18.839
arise so it's Evolution comes from all

00:44:18.839 --> 00:44:21.780
these multiple complex initial States

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.579
right

00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:26.339
in multiple so maybe it's all about time

00:44:26.339 --> 00:44:29.579
so multiple complex initial States as

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:32.940
Justin was are moving toward multiple

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:37.040
future potential States

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.220
and what an agent is in this flow is

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.160
it's a transducer

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.060
so when the multiple possible

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.700
multiple initial States

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.640
um hit this Singularity called Bonnie

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.160
if something else comes out the

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:02.400
trajectories are now no longer uh

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.500
isomorphic they they become lensed and

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.440
then now they've changed the

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.400
trajectories of everything that's

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.400
involved is changed so on this side you

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.359
have

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:18.359
the agent is a singularity emerging from

00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:21.839
many possible previous States

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:24.359
from which many possible future States

00:45:24.359 --> 00:45:28.020
emerging and the Agents is

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.839
why it's not just the Flux Of Time the

00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:33.900
flow of time but the Flux Of

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.579
creation

00:45:35.579 --> 00:45:37.560
what do you think

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.660
it's good enough for government work

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.020
yeah I like it

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:45.920
theory of reality

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:50.460
it relates to uh thing Deepak Chopra has

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.880
designed and is like a bow tie but one

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:59.160
funnel is goes goes uh uh body-minded

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.500
spirit body-minded Spirit on one side

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.200
and then our soul is to enter into the

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.260
other side Soul then Collective Soul and

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:12.300
then on out there so well okay so this

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.700
is an interesting question because

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.940
my thing is two-dimensional but the

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.520
points themselves may have this kind of

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.920
dimension

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.560
uh and I would say the points and those

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.599
would be like singularities like Simone

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:31.680
done and Whitehead and

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.859
yeah that's it I'm seeing it like if it

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:37.079
was 3D or if it was 2D like loads of

00:46:37.079 --> 00:46:39.839
different size circles and then like a

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.460
point where they all meet but then you

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.780
could like kind of have that sort of as

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:44.579
a sphere as well because like you know

00:46:44.579 --> 00:46:46.619
with what Claudia was saying earlier

00:46:46.619 --> 00:46:49.319
around the yeah it also does feel like

00:46:49.319 --> 00:46:51.540
multiple you know it's not just like one

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.180
kind of agent I I when I first kind of

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.099
became aware of it I was like oh cool

00:46:56.099 --> 00:46:58.200
this is like kind of it's guiding the

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.780
way right but then kind of late it was

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.099
like

00:47:02.099 --> 00:47:05.339
uh they were kind of multiple sometimes

00:47:05.339 --> 00:47:07.800
they're conflicting you know and like

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.560
you do have agency of like kind of what

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.119
you want to kind of give your energy to

00:47:12.119 --> 00:47:14.760
I I notice it a lot in my time in

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.740
Nigeria actually

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.180
um and then traveling back and forth

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.099
into different and you're kind of going

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:22.020
over different places like I think again

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.740
it shifts you out of um

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.780
yeah just I guess they have their

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.339
rhythms to it right and like kind of you

00:47:29.339 --> 00:47:31.440
can easily kind of get caught and just

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.300
go in the Rhythm

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.339
then things that sort of jolt you out of

00:47:35.339 --> 00:47:38.640
it give you capacity to kind of uh it's

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.040
like having bifocal uh like kind of

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.599
vision right and like kind of gives you

00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:46.099
more depth Clarity to it

00:47:47.579 --> 00:47:49.380
maybe our the bacteria is in charge

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:52.079
right or the iron particles are in

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:53.280
charge

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.339
well learn marvelous said that bacteria

00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:58.859
were in charge that

00:47:58.859 --> 00:48:01.680
that we were just temporary forms in

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.040
this huge

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.859
microcosmic micro Cosmos of single cell

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:09.599
organisms I spent the there's this

00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:12.960
YouTube channel called the micro Cosmos

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:15.900
I think I might have shown you some

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.319
some things from there and

00:48:19.319 --> 00:48:22.440
I spent I spent a lot of time looking at

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.200
them thinking like what are you what do

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.780
you little things doing in that that

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.260
adds up to like action

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.480
I did read once that there are more

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.880
bacteria on the planet than all other

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.160
organic material combined which is

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.260
pretty mind-boggling

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.780
but the difference that I'm noting when

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.720
I was listening here is that

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.960
as a human the range of what we can

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:51.960
attend to is way broader than any other

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.839
animal thus the impact of our choices

00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:56.579
and the possibility of being creative

00:48:56.579 --> 00:48:59.819
within that is immensely magnified so

00:48:59.819 --> 00:49:01.680
your little bow tie we have many more

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.660
options coming in even though we're

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:05.460
influenced by the environment completely

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.859
and many poor possibilities going out

00:49:07.859 --> 00:49:09.720
yeah

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.240
I I just want to add it sounds to me

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.460
like the pop-up School your bow tie

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:15.420
Theory

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:19.380
you pull it you place your your thumb up

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:21.000
is the thing in the middle people come

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.480
in and then they pop out and then but

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.380
specifically Bonnie your

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:32.819
um initial States bringing the tune

00:49:32.819 --> 00:49:36.060
we arrive in the middle as an agent and

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:40.859
the transducer the music turns into some

00:49:40.859 --> 00:49:45.140
kind of weird potential state

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.960
well actually that's that's kind of you

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.460
know like people complain because I'm

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.260
not prescriptive and I don't say well

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.619
then you should do this or I mean and

00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:57.839
and basically oh I had that's what it

00:49:57.839 --> 00:49:59.460
was years ago I had this argument with

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:00.960
Zack Stein and I said the difference

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.660
between you and me it's like you have a

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.540
moral Cannon and and you have it all

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:08.460
worked out and I just want to inject

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.680
novelty into the system because to me

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.020
it's like like it's just we don't know

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.000
what to do but can we just change the

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.160
shape of our bodies or some do something

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.520
that's not in the same Groove

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.440
um

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.280
because I I I I I believe that the the

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.440
potential is latent in the system and

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.980
it's the habit and the groove uh that

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.500
can potentially suck the energy out of

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.579
it you know

00:50:35.579 --> 00:50:38.720
and yeah

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.579
as I said I told this joke to you before

00:50:41.579 --> 00:50:44.819
but at one of the graduations of one of

00:50:44.819 --> 00:50:46.619
the cohorts the mother was looking at

00:50:46.619 --> 00:50:49.140
her child who seemed to be headed for a

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.839
life of crime and poverty and I said

00:50:51.839 --> 00:50:53.760
well we promise to make them different

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.280
we don't promise to make them better

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.700
foreign

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.040
this is our slogan transformational

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.740
education we promise to make you

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.020
different we don't promise to make you

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.319
better

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:15.420
so I just want to come in with um I was

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:17.280
very stirred by um

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.260
uh Justin

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.920
tuning into the slowest you know deepest

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.880
vibration and continuing your reach in

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.400
terms of what's perceptible and what

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.780
what can I actually in my being

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:36.900
participate in on some level and then

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.700
and then the other side potentially of

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.520
the cone is how can I participate on

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.059
these micro levels and have that that be

00:51:45.059 --> 00:51:47.520
and it feels like maybe part of the of

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.760
the project of Consciousness which is

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.540
putting in very

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.180
um structured words is

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.980
holding

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:03.720
to use your word Claudia intentionality

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.800
um

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.760
in a in a broad spectrum

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:12.359
so that each at each

00:52:12.359 --> 00:52:13.880
vibrational

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.680
manifestation maybe can be

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.880
also true and also true and also true

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.260
or also alive or something but but

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.260
um

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:35.160
I I I feel deeply stirred by

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.619
the possibility that I can hold

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.440
Way Beyond

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:48.420
somehow and it's not up to me to be able

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:52.319
to do that I think on my own devices

00:52:52.319 --> 00:52:55.559
I wouldn't be able to do that and so

00:52:55.559 --> 00:53:00.839
it's how do I not be me in such a way

00:53:00.839 --> 00:53:01.920
that

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.200
what else is there

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.460
I can experience

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.099
when I share a little section of a poem

00:53:20.099 --> 00:53:21.900
that's come into mind

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.420
can I ask you to say to read it again

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.819
and but I want everyone

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.020
to

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.260
hear that the eye that is talking is the

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:23.240
Ultimate Compound individual God

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.980

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.440
you know an isolated brain

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.140
embodied at space-time

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.700

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.900
this self sings with silence

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.300
grateful for how Grace shines

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.079
this was great hearing us at the second

00:55:34.079 --> 00:55:37.260
time with this invitation within a just

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.240
I I just like to just have to see like

00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.099
before this this picture of a mobile

00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:44.520
strip come also you know this band this

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.680
trip where you have this twist inside

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.520
like this is also like just um

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.500
like the like the thing you you

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.740
mentioned yeah

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.540
yeah it reminds me of something you once

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.940
said Barney about truth sense

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:03.920
there's a truth sense about that color

00:56:09.559 --> 00:56:13.140
there's also something

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.359
extremely

00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:16.980
precious

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.700
because

00:56:19.859 --> 00:56:21.900
Stevie was saying well when you walk in

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.780
the middle the meadow is walking in

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.119
itself kind of thing and that all

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:30.110
prompted me thinking that

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:31.260
[Music]

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.780
um well that

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.080
yeah

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.960
[Music]

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.540
so when you think of it as God saying

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.420
that it's obviously that God is saying

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.960
that because

00:56:46.859 --> 00:56:49.260
that's the mobile strip I think that

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.260
yeah

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:56.059
but um

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.980
I might have to use that as the as the

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.680
you know when you write a book and then

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:07.200
there's one page that hasn't quote

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:10.150
so my book The Once and Future God

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:14.670
[Music]

00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:16.240
[Applause]

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.390
[Music]

00:57:19.619 --> 00:57:26.300
hey welcome to all right God AKA JJ

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.720
the god in the room instead of the

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.700
elephant in the room this is interesting

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:38.700
question so yeah like when you're doing

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:40.500
like Collective inside practice or

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:42.240
Collective presencing and people like oh

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.880
there's an Elephant Room you could say

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.440
where's the god in the room

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.780
you know I just want to bring back the

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.800
idea of flash mob

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.980
and uh

00:58:07.319 --> 00:58:09.420
whatever we were talking about

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.280
um

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.819
compounding division

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.960
and the joy

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.500
the joy of being part of something

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.760
moving differently

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.420
through

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.000
all of these distinct in this case

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.740
humans

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:37.020
um and maybe more maybe butterflies and

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.299
whatever else is there

00:58:39.299 --> 00:58:40.079
um

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:44.819
and yet moving together with a shared

00:58:44.819 --> 00:58:45.960
um

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.119
a shared Joy

00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:50.119
than a shared

00:58:50.119 --> 00:58:54.599
attentiveness and maybe a shared sense

00:58:54.599 --> 00:58:58.440
of writing a purpose that is bigger than

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:02.059
than I personally than my subjectivity

00:59:02.059 --> 00:59:06.059
can compose

00:59:18.059 --> 00:59:20.339
I mean there's so there's a flash mod

00:59:20.339 --> 00:59:22.799
going on inside us already isn't there

00:59:22.799 --> 00:59:24.540
so before we

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.640
kind of flash mob between people there's

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:30.619
one going on inside us

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.940
you know there's a convivial Society

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.240
isn't there already

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.339
going on inside us

00:59:38.339 --> 00:59:40.460
um

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.280
yeah I can get out of the way that is

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.260
yeah well even if you don't have to you

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.240
know it's kind of the you know my livers

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.040
all the cells there are being at the

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.440
moment convivial with each other or

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.319
Flash mobbing

00:59:55.319 --> 00:59:57.720
so yeah how yeah

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.520
what they're following a rhythm

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.160
um

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.900
yeah what does Michael Levin say in

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.780
Morpher space right or something what

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.579
does that mean

01:00:11.579 --> 01:00:14.280
no no immune system too you know they're

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.020
just killing and then something happens

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.980
they're like shh

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.380
they all meet up

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:27.440
beat up things usually but that's okay

01:00:40.859 --> 01:00:43.700
Bonnie earlier you said

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.940
beings as causal agents at another scale

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.520
of reality

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.720
so how does that relate to this

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.359
fleshing out of compound

01:00:57.359 --> 01:01:00.079
beings

01:01:06.299 --> 01:01:08.880
so

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.720
one way in which people humans have

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.299
always assigned

01:01:15.299 --> 01:01:18.780
agency to or some kind of spirit or

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:23.880
intention is is by their cause causal

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:29.280
properties right so the the

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.059
you know people the animists think that

01:01:33.059 --> 01:01:36.260
the weather patterns like the the

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.059
tornado is actually a being

01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:42.720
because it has causal properties

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.599
um and the mountain is a being because

01:01:45.599 --> 01:01:49.859
it has causal properties I mean it it

01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:52.400
is responsible for how the weather

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.380
accumulates up there and I mean and here

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.420
we can actually say causal properties is

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.299
just transduction right that things go

01:02:00.299 --> 01:02:02.220
in and they're different when they bump

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.799
into something so it's some kind of

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.579
transduction pattern let's say so

01:02:11.579 --> 01:02:13.559
um a magnet

01:02:13.559 --> 01:02:16.500
seems like a being because it attracts

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:23.359
things right and so so but all but

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.200
um

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.500
so but those are at different scales

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.520
right like like an electron

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.700
um

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:40.200
so a a tornadoes are very big causal

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.540
thing with a smoke with us very short

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:46.140
temper direct temporal duration comes

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.940
and goes

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.540
um

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.059
and

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:52.380
um

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.799
so one way to identify we're trying to

01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:57.839
figure out where do we assign a compound

01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:01.260
individual so the kind of causal

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:04.859
properties I have are different than the

01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:08.819
causal properties that my bacteria and

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:11.520
my gut have and so

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.780
if we think of

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.319
and that's where we can say that they're

01:03:19.319 --> 01:03:22.020
different that I'm a compounded from

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.599
them because when I look at their life

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:26.339
then they have a different kind of

01:03:26.339 --> 01:03:30.299
causal agency that I have right so

01:03:30.299 --> 01:03:32.579
um and then of course there's overlap

01:03:32.579 --> 01:03:35.299
you know I'm not going to say a a

01:03:35.299 --> 01:03:38.400
paraplegic person who can't run and

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.440
doesn't have the causal agency that I

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.240
have it's not a human being so there's

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.359
there's there's more to this but

01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:46.079
um

01:03:46.079 --> 01:03:47.940
and so

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:50.000
um

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.980
so those are just causal agents at

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.660
different scales so it's one way to

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.059
understand how we categorize

01:03:57.059 --> 01:03:59.640
what is an agent

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.099
um and a lot of times how we categorize

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:03.059
that

01:04:03.059 --> 01:04:05.520
is the kind of causality

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.280
that it has

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.460
um

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.160
so now we can work that backwards so

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.619
people are doing physics

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:19.920
and they see that there's they can't

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.040
account for certain effects

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.960
so they must say ah there must be a

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.819
causal agent there called the Higgs

01:04:26.819 --> 01:04:29.280
boson then they go looking for it

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.619
so can it can work backwards and

01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:34.680
sometimes as humans we've actually made

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.160
up things like that that that we I mean

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.920
they're useful because

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.480
they're words that stand in as

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.839
placeholders for real effects that we

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:47.280
see

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.400
um but even the physicists sometimes

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.559
criticize themselves because of the

01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:55.380
complexity and the subtlety of what

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.140
they're looking at is so heavily relied

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.319
on Theory that they're not sure it's

01:05:01.319 --> 01:05:05.160
useful to call it an actual thing right

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.079
so

01:05:07.079 --> 01:05:10.799
I said that I Define science as a set of

01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:14.119
action protocols

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.760
um to achieve results predicted by the

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.900
theory

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.119
and sometimes

01:05:21.119 --> 01:05:23.040
um that gives you correct information

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.819
it's the the and sometimes

01:05:26.819 --> 01:05:29.700
it gives you

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:34.200
a context in which your theory uh seems

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.240
to be validated but there's there's

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.400
aspects of the experiment that you don't

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.339
understand so it's a false it's a false

01:05:41.339 --> 01:05:45.720
validation it's called like

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.859
yeah it's called the epistemic fallacy

01:05:49.859 --> 01:05:51.920
um

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:55.680
very simply I know I'm going out but

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.839
very simply I could walk onto an Indian

01:05:57.839 --> 01:06:00.839
reservation and prove that people of

01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:05.640
Native American descent uh have lower IQ

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.520
and I could do that very rigorously but

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:10.980
the context I'm missing is the whole

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:14.040
history of Indians in in Indian

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.140
reservations and the whole historical

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.599
cultural so this is what is often the

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:21.240
case in the scientific experiment except

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.240
what's missing is not so obvious as you

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.559
have to be an idiot to miss that

01:06:27.559 --> 01:06:31.260
although in the recent past people have

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:33.420
run empirical studies like that and

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:35.400
actually completely missed the context

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.220
that took the postmodernists to uh

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.680
to point that out so

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.380
um

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.599
yeah it doesn't I mean language itself

01:06:45.599 --> 01:06:48.780
in its course green nature just do that

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.940
with like our experience like to even

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.039
call Meadow

01:06:53.039 --> 01:06:55.740
a thing a medical isn't really it's not

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:58.020
really a meadow it's

01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:02.539
right language is very tricky it's but

01:07:02.539 --> 01:07:07.579
it depends okay where it depends what

01:07:07.579 --> 01:07:11.339
you want language to do language is very

01:07:11.339 --> 01:07:15.359
good at me saying Beto

01:07:15.359 --> 01:07:18.299
and maybe you can't see it yet so I

01:07:18.299 --> 01:07:19.980
could also point to it that's not so

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.200
tricky you wouldn't be so skeptical if I

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.079
pointed at something right now what's if

01:07:25.079 --> 01:07:29.280
I'm going like this and then I say bird

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:32.760
so this is much more simple functional

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.880
of language right so a lot of times

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.520
language is just a way to point

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.260
um they could point out emotions you

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.200
could point out all kinds of things

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.319
um and so in that case

01:07:46.319 --> 01:07:50.400
um the word metal is not problematic

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.260
but then when I try to deconstruct what

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.960
a meadow is I'm actually trying to

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.599
deconstruct the word and then it it

01:07:57.599 --> 01:07:59.119
it it

01:07:59.119 --> 01:08:01.260
deconstructs itself because it's just

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.099
it's just a point it's just a pointer

01:08:05.099 --> 01:08:07.859
right yeah and when does it obstruct our

01:08:07.859 --> 01:08:11.039
direct experience of phenomenon right

01:08:11.039 --> 01:08:14.160
right so then sometimes

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.440
um in all kinds of things can happen you

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:18.779
could grow up thinking the first time

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:22.020
your mother pointed to a meadow you saw

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.640
a blackbird

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.520
and then you know next time the little

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.120
kid goes backward you know because these

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.040
things that can be funny like that but

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.480
but

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.900
the more the more Rich you're trying to

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.900
uh

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:42.960
point the more subtle you're trying to

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.179
point to the more language gets tricky

01:08:45.179 --> 01:08:48.960
and the the you know Alan Watts said

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.640
this any kind of Guru or uh teacher

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:56.100
a lot of the methodology in the pop-up

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.319
School is

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.480
to make sure that people aren't looking

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:03.179
at the language and running a simulation

01:09:03.179 --> 01:09:05.279
in their mind

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.380
but always trying to use language to

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.020
point to something I mean when we're

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.000
talking about these crazy things we've

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.380
talked about today these are actually

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:15.480
expected with a philosophy and we're all

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.500
in the imaginary with each other but

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.560
um

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:26.880
yeah so it's it's very tricky

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.140
um and of course there's a lot of

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.859
teachers that

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.620
I would say viveki is one of them and a

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:38.100
most western Buddhist who

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.259
when they're pointing to stuff they're

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:43.679
really pointing to the abstraction and

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.199
not you know that they're not able to

01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:48.600
really understand

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.060
moving and out of what language is doing

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.219
you've seen me talk to some of these

01:09:53.219 --> 01:09:55.199
meditators and I and I have to say now

01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:57.480
you gotta you gotta cut me a break

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.760
because every time I use a word you're

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.140
going to tell me well that's just an

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.120
abstraction

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.000
and I have to say I'm just that's not

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.340
how I'm using words I know that I'm

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.560
using abstractions but that's not what

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.260
I'm talking about you know because

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:16.320
they've learned very quickly to

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.480
deconstruct they're Western Buddhists

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.920
because they're post-modern Buddhists

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.460
they you know so but language is is an

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.940
instrument can be a very valuable tool

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.860
um

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:30.980
um

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.120
especially if

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.300
um you know can be a valuable tool it's

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.400
very helpful to tool for people to

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:49.560
run uh shared simulations right so

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.880
um that's a little bit of what we're

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.000
doing today and Phoebe's got an idea

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.239
she's simulating something imaginary

01:10:56.239 --> 01:10:59.880
she's she's wants to share that

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.620
um

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.860
it's it's always it's not the content of

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.820
experiences of a problem it's it's if

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.060
you're aware of what kind of experience

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:15.780
is it that is happening you know like

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.380
like

01:11:18.659 --> 01:11:21.000
you've seen two people argue and they

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.620
argue and they argue and they argue and

01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.120
they start splitting hairs and gets more

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.440
and more abstract

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.260
and then you step back and you say what

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.940
is it about people that they do this

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.920
okay so now you're like

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.440
you're not inside the experience you're

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:39.659
like how what is what is this you know

01:11:39.659 --> 01:11:41.719
um

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.460
but it's very hard like I was trying to

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.380
tell Greg Enriquez the other day that

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.840
that we can speak that we have a

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.760
language humans

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.420
is part of our cognitive capacity

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.239
the same way that other animals have

01:11:57.239 --> 01:11:59.580
languages right

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:03.540
that we use language to create big huge

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.219
justification systems

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.600
doesn't mean that what we justify is

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.719
cognitively correct

01:12:15.719 --> 01:12:18.060
like you can see

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.800
cognition

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.440
expanding

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:25.159
but

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.260
you could use language a species could

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.800
use language in a way that's completely

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.500
evolutionarily dead end

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.120
that we use language in a more

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.580
sophisticated way is a higher cognitive

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:39.840
capacity

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.460
that

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.400
we use it to make all those theories and

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.100
epistemologies could be

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:49.560
an evolutionary dead end

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.179
and what

01:12:51.179 --> 01:12:54.600
most people think is that once you get

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.400
human language everything they do with

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.880
it is higher on the latter no

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.340
there could be a species that uses

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.800
language in a way that we wouldn't

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.840
recognize as language maybe that's what

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.320
we do years down the line so the what we

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.780
do with language

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.640
you see the difference

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.679
that language becomes more and more

01:13:16.679 --> 01:13:19.679
sophisticated is hardwired into the

01:13:19.679 --> 01:13:22.920
fabric of evolution

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.620
but that are epistemologies get more and

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:27.480
more sophisticated doesn't mean it's not

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.800
an evolutionary dead end

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:34.080
just like there are species who have

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.840
languages that didn't

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.179
you know they might have gone extinct

01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:41.520
because it didn't fit the situation the

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:45.900
way so this is a distinction that

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.219
the cognitive science show is not able

01:13:49.219 --> 01:13:53.460
to do so they think for example that

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:55.440
realizing God is at the end of

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.699
philosophy

01:13:56.699 --> 01:14:00.179
not up the cognitive stock like Justin

01:14:00.179 --> 01:14:03.380
said like

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.300
does that make sense

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.900
a little

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.719
yeah it feels connected to like

01:14:11.719 --> 01:14:15.300
oh so JJ I'm just going to say language

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:17.640
that way

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.940
yeah like JJ's poem uh is up the

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:23.760
cognitive stock I don't mean to make

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.940
language like the postman I'm just

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.060
 mad no no I'm just I'm just

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:35.420
riffing like the way JJ use language

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.860
I would say is up the cognitive stock

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.739
because you can see that it's reflecting

01:14:40.739 --> 01:14:44.760
a cognitive cognitive awareness

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.580
that is higher it was like the

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:51.739
Aboriginal painting exactly

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.239
so I was just gonna say what you were

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:55.620
saying kind of yeah makes me think of

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:56.699
like when you're talking about the

01:14:56.699 --> 01:14:57.960
difference between the nature of mind

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.800
and kinds of Mind exactly exactly so the

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.840
nature of mind gets to language and

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:07.140
that's a bigger mutation

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.679
um and this is actually true in in you

01:15:10.679 --> 01:15:12.540
know I always beat up on developmental

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.280
stage Theory uh

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.540
I have to tell you this can you before

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:20.280
when you first came to the pop-up school

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:23.100
I interviewed interacted with you in a

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.000
weird way

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.640
because I had conflated you with Katie

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.920
hikingen who's a developmental stage

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.060
terrorist and I don't know if you

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.340
remember a couple of times I said things

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.600
and I'm like

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.600
it was weird then I met Katie hiking in

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.260
this past month at Maple and I and it

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:42.060
pinged back and I was like that's what

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:46.440
was going on with me I forget

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.140
for what I don't didn't even think so

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.420
Suzanne quick writer said you know when

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.580
you're when you're doing these tests at

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.659
these people

01:15:54.659 --> 01:15:57.000
the tests High

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.580
that when you take her course she always

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.140
shows you know she shows all the

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.000
sophisticated reasoning and those and

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.280
then she shows you a roomy poem and she

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.440
said how do you how do you instantly

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:10.199
know this is higher it's

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.300
simpler in a way and the words are

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.600
smaller and you don't have all this

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.300
systemic reasoning and so this is the

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.960
distinction that you know is is made but

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.420
often undervalued or overlooked

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.739
I love that question how do you know

01:16:31.739 --> 01:16:35.640
that the roomy poem is a higher yeah

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.620
it's a great question

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.659
and of course when she puts it up there

01:16:39.659 --> 01:16:42.239
everybody knows there's a muscle that

01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:43.500
knows right

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.199
but to be in that question how do I know

01:16:46.199 --> 01:16:49.199
yeah that's like that's

01:16:49.199 --> 01:16:52.020
opening the

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.060
what we it's actually what we're doing

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:55.940
in our pop-up School

01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:01.159
how do I know what you know yeah

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:05.280
I was just gonna say uh I wrote my

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.980
thesis uh in theology school

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:11.580
debt a couple decades ago and I and I

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.920
was talking about how um

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.860
going into my father's Armory

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.920
which was his study his Library

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.040
and there were all these books that held

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.199
the meaning of the world

01:17:25.199 --> 01:17:29.580
and what I was left with was but why

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:33.260
don't I know who I am

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.260
and that's that's not to say every

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.940
single book was

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.900
um

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.420
the the whatever you said earlier that

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:45.360
it was not necessarily true that the

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.520
cognition

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.560
to something true but there's so much

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.159
there that we give authority to and how

01:17:53.159 --> 01:17:55.020
do we know

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:58.320
how do we know when there is more

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.420
Authority in something or more or more

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.480
truth and and I'll say when when well

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.940
all of this conversation has been deeply

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.640
stirring and exciting

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.159
um and but in particular Justin when you

01:18:11.159 --> 01:18:13.260
talked about that that

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:18.000
hire our that longer Arc of vibration my

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.640
whole body said

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:24.239
whoa you know there's a There's

01:18:24.239 --> 01:18:27.920
Something Real and True here

01:18:28.679 --> 01:18:32.060
and it's not in language

01:18:32.219 --> 01:18:34.080
no which is why I keep coming back to

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.360
the Aboriginal painting when Justin was

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.120
sharing that I went back into that

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.340
painting and

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.760
at the realization that the mind that

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.320
made this painting is a different mind

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.640
than

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.960
than we are

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:59.960
I have something bubbling

01:19:01.739 --> 01:19:04.460
who's leaving

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.440
um oh

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.620
um

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.340
I came into the class today to see what

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.420
I was looking at

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.820
and I knew my mind would be stimulated

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.400
and I wanted to see

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:34.140
moment to moment what am I looking at

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:38.659
so what I've been seeing

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.940
is this play

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:46.380
with

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:49.159
language

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:53.640
and so many of you when you were sharing

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.640
deeply

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.719
used gestures

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:05.420
Claudia said Bonnie's art

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.219
and what's bubbling for me

01:20:11.219 --> 01:20:14.040
is

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.300
the intention of the meadow coming

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.300
into

01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:26.040
the flesh Mob of the body the intention

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:29.760
of the meadow and what is this intention

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.719
of nature as we sit here

01:20:33.719 --> 01:20:37.500
to give us the gesture and to give us

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.560
the body sense of what the person is

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.300
saying beyond the words

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.000
what

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:51.360
so it seems like

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.260
we are moving into nature today

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:58.440
through our I mean Katie knows I think

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.400
with my hands but

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:06.300
there's just something

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.360
bigger about how each of you has been

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:13.580
gesturing as you use language

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.040
I will say that

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.800
in my perspective

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.960
the longer wavelengths are more

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:26.300
conscious

01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.040
infants are riding longer wavelengths

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.320
and we teach them to narrow it down they

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.840
don't ever lose that my children are 40

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.480
and 39 or whatever they are and they're

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.719
still their Essence is still there

01:21:39.719 --> 01:21:42.420
so when something touches that longer

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.640
wavelength

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:45.840
like

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.679
JJ's poem it reverberates oh I know that

01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:50.760
space

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.159
it's familiar here

01:21:53.159 --> 01:21:56.880
and even the the children that live on

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.699
this planet

01:21:58.699 --> 01:22:01.920
they might not be touching that 72

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.500
million year span I don't know

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.080
I mean they may come from the spinning

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.300
of the planet for all I know but they're

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.800
all there and they're all available but

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.820
the longest wavelengths in my experience

01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.420
are quieter softer

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.140
and deep

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.640
it reminds me of

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.500
some

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.239
I don't know what

01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:32.280
religion it was Buddhist or whatever

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.679
when you looked into the Buddha's mouth

01:22:34.679 --> 01:22:36.659
and you opened his mouth but no it was

01:22:36.659 --> 01:22:38.820
Krishna or something and the whole world

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.420
was there

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:49.500
no you you go Bonnie

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.600
I was going to also say more intimate as

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:53.699
just a question he said longer deeper I

01:22:53.699 --> 01:22:54.900
think

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:57.360
um and more intimate and oh I I'm

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.460
wondering about more intimate and the

01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:01.320
reason I'm saying that is while we were

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.140
talking about language I was remembering

01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:05.640
listening to a Tracker who was talking

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.460
about following footprints

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:11.640
or paw prints or something and was

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.620
making the link between that and letters

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.360
you know what would future in the future

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:18.120
become letters and writing

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:18.840
um

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.739
and he also taught a kind of long

01:23:22.739 --> 01:23:25.440
intimate

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.560
you know deep trying using your words

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.620
and adding intimacy participation with

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:34.739
the track with the language right so it

01:23:34.739 --> 01:23:37.800
was kind of reading

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.199
reality

01:23:40.199 --> 01:23:42.900
reading the language right of reality in

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:46.260
the tracks and

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:50.400
yeah developing those kinds of eyes

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.179
you know beyond tracks I think is maybe

01:23:54.179 --> 01:23:56.820
a little bit also David what you were

01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:02.580
trying to read in nature somehow yeah

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:04.380
but also we're kind of pulling in I

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.300
think yeah the other bit was

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.239
kind of pulling into the the intimacy

01:24:09.239 --> 01:24:10.320
would

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.840
pull him into the track and then see

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.679
more

01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:16.140
and ask more questions and not really

01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.820
close them but just keep asking

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.080
questions

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.360
of what the track was trying to say and

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.880
he would rarely kind of answer the

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.860
question you know like what time did

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.260
this animal come through which would

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.300
create another question which direction

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:31.980
was it going which would create another

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:34.219
question so there was this kind of

01:24:34.219 --> 01:24:37.860
opening that just was endless

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.420
and and we don't really treat language

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.760
that way do we language for us is kind

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.560
of a hard stop but this language of the

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:44.940
track

01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:48.560
was a different kind of language

01:24:50.699 --> 01:24:55.400
I think also one could

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:59.699
hypothesize or imagine that the speed in

01:24:59.699 --> 01:25:02.880
which we Everything Changes like as it

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.140
speeds up

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:08.040
is actually like Justin said like it's

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.320
just going to self-destruct like we're

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.080
at this peak where like

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.320
everybody's on a action reaction cycle

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.239
of a nanosecond right with the

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.320
we move at the speed of the electrons

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.140
and the electrons just flip bits at like

01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:30.780
the fastest thing in the world and

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:35.040
and we allow that to organize our

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.040
our knowledge right there's some I don't

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.300
know there's something I'm playing with

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.719
it but there's there's something about

01:25:42.719 --> 01:25:45.239
I agree with Justin I would say even

01:25:45.239 --> 01:25:46.620
when we were doing the awareness

01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.840
exercises you notice you had to stop

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.199
being

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.239
this and this and this and you you

01:25:54.239 --> 01:25:56.340
actually feel like you're spreading out

01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.620
and you can feel that if you have the

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:02.040
capacity to spread out

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.139
to the universe you could be you had

01:26:04.139 --> 01:26:06.600
enough time and space to be aware of

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.360
everything at the same time which would

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.800
be could be a definition of more

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.179
conscious it wouldn't be more yeah and

01:26:15.179 --> 01:26:17.219
then you would experience

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:20.699
the prime primordial rhythmicity of what

01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:23.000
whatever

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.960
however

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.900
open your awarenesses

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:32.760
it dials in what rhythmicity you can tap

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.739
into I would say that there's some kind

01:26:34.739 --> 01:26:37.080
of relationship there

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.139
um

01:26:39.239 --> 01:26:43.260
I just wanted to read this uh in

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:44.880
response to David there's so many

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.219
synchronicities happening here

01:26:47.219 --> 01:26:48.960
um that

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.960
I had just read this this morning that

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.620
janza Wiki calls gesture which she calls

01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.860
gesture is the immediate untutored

01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:02.280
response of a human being to meaning

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.040
the immediate untutored response of a

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.440
human being to meaning is gesture

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.400
would you say that one more time

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.679
please I'll write it in the chat because

01:27:16.679 --> 01:27:17.760
it's

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.699
kind of a mouthful

01:27:20.699 --> 01:27:23.159
I want to say to Kate Claudia rather

01:27:23.159 --> 01:27:25.980
that um I think intimacy is a good word

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:28.800
for that softer length because I

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:31.260
remember once saying to a friend of mine

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:33.360
in response to something she said the

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.760
vulnerability is the access to intimacy

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.620
and I think those kinds of words do

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:39.080
portray

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:44.159
that those deeper spaces and like JJ's

01:27:44.159 --> 01:27:47.639
words arise from that space and point to

01:27:47.639 --> 01:27:50.100
it just like or Bender or Meister record

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:52.199
anybody else we like reading that stuff

01:27:52.199 --> 01:27:55.560
because we resonate some have a part of

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.659
us is resonating in that space just like

01:27:57.659 --> 01:28:00.659
Tai Chi is this

01:28:00.659 --> 01:28:02.820
you know it's not rapid it's like

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.679
getting yourself in tune with something

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:06.840
that's moving a bit slower than our

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.199
normal

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:13.020
attention span focuses on or attention

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:15.980
folks and so on

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.920
foreign

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.100
maybe maybe part of intimacy is

01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:49.739
slowing down enough

01:28:49.739 --> 01:28:53.699
to be able to experience

01:28:53.699 --> 01:28:56.760
and perceive and therefore to help come

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.620
alive

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:02.699
all a spectrum of speed a spectrum of

01:29:02.699 --> 01:29:04.920
vibrational

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.780
um being and so uh so so there's a way

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.580
in which it's inclusive

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.600
so that

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.260
and the possibility for what's being

01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:25.400
inclusive to be

01:29:25.679 --> 01:29:26.699
um

01:29:26.699 --> 01:29:28.679
you know

01:29:28.679 --> 01:29:31.620
alive in itself

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:35.060
Mirror Mirror

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.280
yeah just ping off that I I think the

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.520
intimacy can broaden the bandwidth let's

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.380
say

01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.540
into a kind of field you know whatever

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.880
yeah that's that's good that's the uh we

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.219
just said that bandwidth the the long

01:30:02.219 --> 01:30:04.980
thing is about an intimacy and then

01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:07.620
intimacy can

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:11.100
yeah the the two sides of the same coin

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.360
in a lid yeah

01:30:18.719 --> 01:30:20.880
Anthony how do you link intimacy with

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.880
sensitivity

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.580
um

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:31.320
well I think we have to be careful

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.260
because

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:37.100
these words sensitivity vulnerability

01:30:37.100 --> 01:30:40.219
they have negative

01:30:40.219 --> 01:30:43.020
meanings right like oh she's so

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.520
sensitive or something and the problem

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.440
is is because

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.659
it's very hard for us to be intimate so

01:30:48.659 --> 01:30:50.880
we always get hurt and we get hurt when

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.520
we're vulnerable and in a healthy

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.219
Society those wouldn't be so close

01:30:56.219 --> 01:30:58.520
together

01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.340
you wouldn't you you know you would be

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.560
sensitive or senseful to the other but

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:07.739
you wouldn't feel sensitive so the so

01:31:07.739 --> 01:31:09.179
it's just I don't know

01:31:09.179 --> 01:31:10.739
how you're asking the question but

01:31:10.739 --> 01:31:13.380
that's what first comes to me it should

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:15.659
be tricky you know

01:31:15.659 --> 01:31:18.320
um uh

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.900
vulnerability and intimacy

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.300
are so tightly coupled to things that

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.520
make us nervous and scared

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:28.380
uh and you know every day so that's

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.300
something wrong with our

01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:32.340
Society something we have to deal with

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.440
because

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.560
um

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.540
because we don't really understand

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:42.120
intimacy right so

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.219
that's one thing and I think this has

01:31:44.219 --> 01:31:45.540
something to do with the actual

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.060
definition of intimacy mean being a long

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:50.699
bandwidth right if you're intimate with

01:31:50.699 --> 01:31:52.440
someone and then

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:55.199
they yell at you or everything seems to

01:31:55.199 --> 01:31:58.080
be going south and you have this very

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:01.139
very long perspective

01:32:01.139 --> 01:32:04.080
then it doesn't disrupt that and you

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.620
don't feel

01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:10.679
you don't feel hurt by it

01:32:10.679 --> 01:32:14.340
um and you wouldn't necessarily then use

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:17.340
the word I was vulnerable to him see if

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.040
I use that word

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.120
it makes me

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:23.580
um it shows that I'm always dealing with

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.139
a certain amount of anxiety around

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.600
whether I'm going to get hurt

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.480
um so this is a fact of our current

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.679
situation but I don't think it's a prima

01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:37.620
fashion whatever the uh you say that you

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.659
only see it written in academic I never

01:32:39.659 --> 01:32:42.659
hear anyone but she won't say that word

01:32:42.659 --> 01:32:46.260
um involved in the deeper notion of

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.179
intimacy

01:32:48.179 --> 01:32:50.100
um and so

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:52.100
um

01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:54.960
but I also when you when you're asking

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:57.900
that question what immediately comes to

01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.440
my mind is that

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.840
intimacy so there's I think what I'm

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.460
going to say now is like just another

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:08.300
way to say what I just said now that but

01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:14.159
intimacy without this nervousness

01:33:14.159 --> 01:33:14.940
um

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:20.940
it's a kind of sensitivity with clarity

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:24.000
right so that you have the sensitivity

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.060
to see someone perfectly in the intimacy

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:29.520
for that to be show up as love right so

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.040
everything perfectly seen is loved you

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:33.659
have to have a tremendous amount of

01:33:33.659 --> 01:33:36.420
sensitivity to see something perfectly

01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:38.460
and

01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.760
um but also

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:44.239
uh profound Clarity

01:33:44.239 --> 01:33:47.460
and this is I used to say this all the

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.500
time when I did the collective Insight

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.139
Retreats that

01:33:52.139 --> 01:33:53.880
because you know when you start a

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.320
collective Insight Retreats you have

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.400
this normal polarity that uh that the

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.760
masculine wants to have Clarity and The

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.739
Feminine wants to be embodied and be

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:08.940
real sensitive and I would say you know

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.360
they're both distortions and how and we

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.179
don't and we see them as a polarity

01:34:15.179 --> 01:34:17.820
um but this is also a distortion of the

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.820
of the human experience that they they

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:25.320
actually work toward the same direction

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.880
um and one without the other is a

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:29.280
distortion right but we have the body

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.139
Minds we have and so there are some

01:34:31.139 --> 01:34:33.239
people who are very talented at being

01:34:33.239 --> 01:34:35.940
sensitive but they're overwhelmed and so

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.639
they can't you know the the they're not

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:42.020
clear and then we so we're kind of we

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:44.219
these energies are kind of like

01:34:44.219 --> 01:34:46.440
distributed functions in our society we

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.940
shouldn't be fighting with it but the

01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:51.060
goal of the of a human being in the

01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:54.360
future uh what I would say is is the

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.060
goal of insight practice or these free

01:34:57.060 --> 01:35:01.020
space practices is to see them

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:04.020
as as

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:05.880
um

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.880
see that when they're separated they're

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:11.120
broken

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.380
um so how can you be sensitive with

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:16.139
Clarity this is it this is a lifelong

01:35:16.139 --> 01:35:18.000
project but it's it's a I like it

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.440
because it's a project for both

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.900
masculine and feminine types it's the

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.179
same project

01:35:24.179 --> 01:35:27.679
go you know so

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.780
that's not to me to say that what ends

01:35:30.780 --> 01:35:32.699
up is everyone looks the same there's

01:35:32.699 --> 01:35:35.100
still different skill sets and different

01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:39.000
uh uh categories but

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.960
um for me this is the challenge for

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.480
especially when when we started these

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:49.080
groups years ago there was a very strong

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.520
so we're already there

01:35:59.699 --> 01:36:02.219
I asked Ria back if she wanted to do

01:36:02.219 --> 01:36:05.580
experiments with chat GPT and Collective

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.780
presidency

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.659
so that to see chat GPT could give

01:36:09.659 --> 01:36:12.600
language to some of these Expressions

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.199
that

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.520
people have when they really feel

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:19.920
something and and that they're not

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.500
they're not that clear about it

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:24.120
I mean I think it would be fun I don't

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:27.199
think it would be useful but

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.940
well somebody in the group did Brandon

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:33.239
David Phoebe know did ask GPT a question

01:36:33.239 --> 01:36:36.719
and it gave a very eloquent answer and

01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:38.880
Rio's response was some of those words

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:43.260
are mine yeah okay so this is this is

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:44.760
actually

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.739
um

01:36:46.739 --> 01:36:49.800
so the people on the liminal web or the

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.159
people that like you you all would take

01:36:53.159 --> 01:36:55.199
courses from it's not a very large group

01:36:55.199 --> 01:36:58.020
of people and you could train chat GPT

01:36:58.020 --> 01:37:00.900
on the select group of people so it

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.480
would retrain people's minds you know so

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.699
like I have some someone who's building

01:37:05.699 --> 01:37:06.780
one

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.540
um and the cool thing about it they're

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.639
building one on my work is that I can

01:37:11.639 --> 01:37:13.560
write any old thing doesn't have the

01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:16.139
sentence structure doesn't have to make

01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:18.139
sense or anything because it's just

01:37:18.139 --> 01:37:21.600
training on how like these phrases I use

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.320
more than so so you can just like keep

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:27.840
pouring in and like one of the

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.580
things we're training is not to talk

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:32.699
about complex adaptive systems they have

01:37:32.699 --> 01:37:35.580
to talk about comp take all these

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:38.219
dynamics that refer to complex adaptive

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:40.739
system and speak in the language of

01:37:40.739 --> 01:37:43.380
complex potential States

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:46.679
to have to so like these little these

01:37:46.679 --> 01:37:48.900
little things that like I think are

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:53.100
malware we were reading were were we

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.380
wanted to say things in these other ways

01:37:55.380 --> 01:38:00.020
this I think is very useful uh tool

01:38:00.020 --> 01:38:03.659
uh to it's what we do the pop-up school

01:38:03.659 --> 01:38:05.880
we just keep refirming and refunding and

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.239
reframing in ways that try to exit the

01:38:09.239 --> 01:38:12.199
old way of thinking

01:38:17.639 --> 01:38:20.820
I have to leave but I just wanted to say

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.980
that

01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.040
um since the last session

01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:28.260
um the

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:31.980
making friends or even I'll go further

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:35.340
and say you know falling in love with

01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.020
heart constraints

01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:42.840
has become a bit of a game

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:46.739
and now that you just said

01:38:46.739 --> 01:38:47.520
um

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:51.060
complex potential States I think that

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:53.940
that's the perspective of ship

01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:55.260
that

01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:57.480
if you make friends with hard

01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.320
constraints then it's complex potential

01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.840
states

01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:05.159
that that

01:39:05.159 --> 01:39:09.020
but I just have found myself that

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:12.840
whenever I'm confronted since that

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:15.600
conversation and I'm confronted with one

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.500
of those fur balls of you know do more

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:22.440
 you know I just I just had this

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.520
little smile you know ah here we go hard

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.500
to constraints

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:32.120
but to get it on baby

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:36.060
and uh and write it you know and yeah I

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:39.320
think I think if you're along

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:42.739
writing you know and how the the horse

01:39:42.739 --> 01:39:47.580
and and wanted to go and be competitive

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.620
and you needed to hold it back and then

01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:51.960
you've got that advice and and you are

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.760
like and you know what are people gonna

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.739
think and she's like what the you

01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:56.639
know

01:39:56.639 --> 01:39:59.100
um that's not what matters so it's kind

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:02.280
of combined into this little

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.080
you know

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:07.320
thing that goes from hard constraints

01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.780
writing what the do you care what

01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:13.320
people think and then complex potential

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:15.960
States is what you just gave me now you

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:20.340
know to to kind of do the swoop exactly

01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.920
yeah and then if you're not adapting to

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.020
anything then you're not you don't have

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:27.659
this action reaction cycle to what

01:40:27.659 --> 01:40:30.840
happens it's just how can I just

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.420
open potential and then you can sit back

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.040
oh wow

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:37.080
that's interesting

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:39.780
what happened there any and even from an

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.239
existential standpoint all this kind of

01:40:42.239 --> 01:40:45.000
emphasis on crisis and all this other

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.500
stuff sort of

01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:49.199
turns into this set of way I mean

01:40:49.199 --> 01:40:52.380
because then you go looking for other

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:56.280
times uh like I think I found out you

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.380
know like if you think of what it might

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:01.340
have been like between like 1820 and

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:04.620
1860 where people went from horses to

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:07.800
steam engines and trains and I mean

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:11.040
that's got to be insane I mean there

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.560
were projections of how cities were

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.179
going to be covered in horseshit

01:41:15.179 --> 01:41:18.300
everywhere because that was like a

01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.600
massive problem so on one side you had

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:25.260
you know Horsehead and then now you've

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.020
got all this speed in in all these

01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.960
completely different ways of living I

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:33.260
mean that had to have been

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:36.659
hugely destabilizing in terms of

01:41:36.659 --> 01:41:39.540
day-to-day life but that's the

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.360
definition of what we just depend back

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.880
on what it is to be causally effective

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.880
agent it's not to take the past and

01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:50.580
increase its tractions

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:54.300
so uh trajectory like I said okay we've

01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:57.060
got some horses and now we'll look into

01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.560
the future we're gonna have a lot of

01:41:58.560 --> 01:41:59.760
horses

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:02.400
it's to take the pass and when it goes

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:04.320
through your mind or your body or your

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.420
gesture what comes out is something

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.400
different

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.760
so to be causally effective is to take

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.580
the initial conditions the stream of

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:17.340
causal reality that's coming in

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.820
and when it goes that way it's it's got

01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:24.060
a different class of potential now of

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:26.280
course that doesn't mean it these are

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.280
just little micro

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.320
nudges we can do as human beings but

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:33.719
it's a completely different way to look

01:42:33.719 --> 01:42:36.060
at you don't have a problem situation

01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:39.900
you have a situation room you work with

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.500
and

01:42:44.699 --> 01:42:48.980
yeah we're transducers

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:05.460
personally laughing in the background I

01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:08.239
didn't see her before

01:43:10.139 --> 01:43:12.380
foreign

01:43:24.659 --> 01:43:28.880
no I want to add

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.199
this quote just your quote feels to me

01:43:34.199 --> 01:43:39.020
like a layer got pulled off of

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.440
a doorway into woo way through play

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:49.860
untutored response

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.040
that's tutored

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:12.960
yeah and what you're talking about

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:15.260
Bonnie Wright like requires a certain

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:20.280
like minimum viable intimacy

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:23.940
right so such that our encounter with

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:26.520
what's coming in we're made vulnerable

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:27.600
to it

01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.000
I mean such that what comes out

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.800
can truly

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.080
be different or not an ideology or

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.860
strategy or

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:41.699
be determined yeah also something like

01:44:41.699 --> 01:44:44.159
if you're not intimate because one of

01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:46.500
the definitions intimacy is porosity if

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:49.199
I'm intimate with you like things become

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:52.739
poor self-awther becomes so mostly in a

01:44:52.739 --> 01:44:53.780
context

01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.460
adaptive if you're thinking of adapting

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:59.100
to evolutionary pressure or adapting to

01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:00.600
the situation

01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:03.239
we actually wanted we're like put up our

01:45:03.239 --> 01:45:05.699
Shields and we just wanted to bounce off

01:45:05.699 --> 01:45:08.639
of us right and so you can't transduce

01:45:08.639 --> 01:45:11.100
at all you just become part of the ping

01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:12.320
pong

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:15.780
billiard ball game on this side

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:18.420
um and it's variable way or it's very

01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:20.820
Tai Chi you know when the attacker comes

01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:22.980
at once it comes at you it's very Yin

01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:25.139
you just

01:45:25.139 --> 01:45:27.300
you move out of the way in a way that

01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:29.100
makes the other person move in a

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.960
different way you know it's all like

01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:36.780
um yeah so the the theory of complex

01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:39.719
potential States is is just a theory

01:45:39.719 --> 01:45:43.860
it's just a useful imaginary but I

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:45.600
created it because

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.820
almost everything we talk about in

01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:50.580
society and systems thinking we have

01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:52.980
this go-winning attitude that there's

01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:55.380
pressure put into the system and then

01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:58.020
you have to adapt and it's just like

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:01.320
Action Reaction Cycles so

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.000
everything's gotten to be like that

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.679
economy and geopolitics and it it closed

01:46:07.679 --> 01:46:10.980
it actually closes the system

01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:14.179
um to think that way

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.820
it creates arms races of all kinds

01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.699
I do want to say that um

01:46:23.699 --> 01:46:27.360
vulnerability and intimacy also it's not

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.000
just about what you share it what it's

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
what the space can then evoke from you

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.280
that you didn't know was there if you

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.480
open up

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.639
because in this space I mean it took me

01:46:38.639 --> 01:46:39.840
I don't know eight or ten months before

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:41.520
I started talking much

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.179
and the more I get acclimated the more

01:46:45.179 --> 01:46:49.500
of my unknown parts of me that are

01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.560
included by the energy of everybody

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:55.440
who's here get drawn out of me

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:57.139
and

01:46:57.139 --> 01:47:00.719
spaces that I can like JJ

01:47:00.719 --> 01:47:03.600
speak them into existence because I'm

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.360
then I'm vulnerable to allow the space

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:09.619
to affect me that way

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.860
so people trans you can feel yourself

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:18.060
being transduced by real agency right

01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.860
like

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.940
now I'm being transduced by Justin's

01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.199
statement

01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:29.239
or by this experience

01:47:30.239 --> 01:47:31.619
Bonnie what do you think of forest

01:47:31.619 --> 01:47:33.300
Landry's definition you know love is

01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:35.880
that which enables choice

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.940
um

01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:40.560
you know the problem with these the

01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:44.880
reason why the these curve phrases that

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.280
we share the pop-ups will work for us is

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:49.380
because of just what Justin said because

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:51.239
we have this history and we're becoming

01:47:51.239 --> 01:47:53.159
intimate

01:47:53.159 --> 01:47:56.880
we might take one of our cool phrases

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.159
and ask somebody the question and they'd

01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:00.840
be like well that's a cool phrase you

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.300
know so I don't know what he means I

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:06.000
mean I think it sounds reasonable but it

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.100
I don't know

01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.380
like and I could project a lot of

01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:13.500
meaning around it but I don't

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.560
because it's not it hasn't been like a

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:20.239
process I don't know

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.220
um now having said that my my my

01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:27.380
[Music]

01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:28.980
opinion

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.040
about it so so

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.340
um that would be the generous answer

01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.940
um but I also know something about uh

01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:41.460
Forest Landry as a human being and what

01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:44.219
he struggles with so when I hear that I

01:48:44.219 --> 01:48:46.440
hear something a lot about his

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.100
psychological uh struggle only because I

01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.260
I know I know that so

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.659
um

01:48:58.139 --> 01:49:00.540
it's like when I read David Graver and

01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:04.020
when when girls book um

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:06.420
um the dawn of everything

01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:10.260
I don't I could I can feel them

01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:12.900
really biasing their story because

01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:17.100
they're anarchists I don't I it doesn't

01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:19.139
you're having a conversation with people

01:49:19.139 --> 01:49:21.179
who are

01:49:21.179 --> 01:49:22.980
um

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.920
are shaping The Narrative consciously

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:29.460
you know so so

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.679
whereas sometimes it doesn't I mean

01:49:31.679 --> 01:49:34.139
there's obviously something always

01:49:34.139 --> 01:49:36.540
that play there

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.239
um you know I try to be transparent that

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:41.159
you know I think most of my work is

01:49:41.159 --> 01:49:42.840
because we're destroying the environment

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.340
so I shape how I think and I shape how I

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.139
teach and I shape

01:49:49.139 --> 01:49:51.679
um so

01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:54.360
um but I know choice is a big deal in

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.280
his metaphysics

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.340
um

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.900
what do you think about it

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.500
I I think it pings with this potential

01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:24.360
State thing a little bit because if you

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.739
love someone

01:50:25.739 --> 01:50:28.020
it does seem that you can you kind of

01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:30.840
give them space for more possibility

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.880
to kind of Express themselves fully

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.619
let's say or to

01:50:34.619 --> 01:50:37.639
um yeah

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:40.260
see I and I don't hear that in the word

01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.139
choice to me choice I I feel much more

01:50:43.139 --> 01:50:44.639
like

01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:48.360
control but but

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.000
yeah it's out of context it'd be agency

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.780
yeah yeah

01:50:58.619 --> 01:51:00.060
I'm just going to say something about

01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:01.920
the word love too because

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:03.780
um

01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:07.619
I met my wife in 1977 and my whole being

01:51:07.619 --> 01:51:10.800
just went who are you you know and

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.739
there's a certain velocity I experienced

01:51:13.739 --> 01:51:17.040
in moving towards the energy of who she

01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:17.940
is

01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:19.980
you know we've been married 43 years and

01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:21.960
we there it's like a binary star system

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.840
now the velocity with which we are

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:25.980
moving

01:51:25.980 --> 01:51:30.600
is nowhere near what it was before so

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.760
the oh my God I love you oh my God I

01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.020
love it that's out there the love is

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.900
there but there's a there's a peaceful

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.860
Harmony to it so it's not this

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.300
overwhelming love it's just a matter of

01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.980
fact yeah

01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:45.840
yeah we love each other that's how it is

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.239
but the sensation a lot of people point

01:51:48.239 --> 01:51:50.340
to when they say I'm in love

01:51:50.340 --> 01:51:52.800
I would not describe

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.320
I would describe that as velocity of

01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:58.800
lotion towards each other

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.440
I love that word philosophy in this

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.600
context and as soon as you said velocity

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.980
I thought of orbit

01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.460
right like

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:13.760
yeah

01:52:15.119 --> 01:52:17.040
now the interesting thing about that is

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:19.440
she likes to travel not so much so

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.420
she'll be gone for 10 days I can feel

01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:23.880
the difference when she comes back the

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:26.280
motion towards just in that little bit

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.380
of time time frame

01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:31.159
it's lovely

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:18.080
there's something that in this

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:20.880
conversation about vulnerability and

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:23.460
intimacy and

01:53:23.460 --> 01:53:24.960
um

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:26.580
potential

01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:29.040
States

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.760
uh the word that keeps arising in my

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:36.960
awareness is receptivity

01:53:38.159 --> 01:53:40.880
that

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:43.880
the

01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:48.619
the openness to

01:53:48.619 --> 01:53:52.920
a different kind of causality

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.320
feels very much a part of what we're

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:57.920
talking about

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:04.860
so that's perfect because I was thinking

01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:08.159
saying this and I I forgot but it's like

01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:11.460
remember last year we were talking about

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:14.820
the core self has to figure out the

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:17.460
definitions of self-othering world

01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:20.100
and that is a lifelong process well

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:21.600
that's kind of what we've been doing

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.699
today like what is a compound self is

01:54:23.699 --> 01:54:25.980
itself or others it combined you know

01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.920
like what is if what is a self at the

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:31.080
universal scale what is the world is it

01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.619
a self I mean we're basically in this

01:54:34.619 --> 01:54:37.739
conversation again and remember when I

01:54:37.739 --> 01:54:40.320
said when you're doing that

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:43.739
it's always a question of causality that

01:54:43.739 --> 01:54:46.980
the question of what causality is is

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:49.739
embedded in the construction of some

01:54:49.739 --> 01:54:52.739
other worlds so that this is this is

01:54:52.739 --> 01:54:56.040
perfect because this is exactly

01:54:56.040 --> 01:54:57.719
the project

01:54:57.719 --> 01:55:01.699
uh at a late late stage

01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:03.420
kind of

01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:08.400
uh you know we're not reproducing Early

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.739
Childhood experience but we're bringing

01:55:10.739 --> 01:55:15.360
that one project way into a higher

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:17.639
inquiry

01:55:17.639 --> 01:55:21.000
but yeah you're right it's always in

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.239
that

01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:27.780
inquiry is always the nature of cause

01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:30.500
causation

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:34.139
because if we're members of a larger

01:55:34.139 --> 01:55:37.320
compound individual that would explain a

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.239
lot about synchronicities in this you

01:55:39.239 --> 01:55:41.360
know so all of these things directly

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.080
directly relate

01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.600
one thing just popped into my head you

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.880
know Don Juan Carlos Costa native the

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.560
sorcerer friend

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.320
in one of his books he said he basically

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.060
what he said other words is will the

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:02.040
souls come from the Star and they go

01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:04.320
back to the star

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.139
I kind of like that too makes sense to

01:56:07.139 --> 01:56:09.119
me

01:56:09.119 --> 01:56:11.780
you

01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:13.980
know

01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:16.560
One Last Thing One Last ping we might

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.119
have another one

01:56:18.119 --> 01:56:20.760
um so once this friend of mine I talk

01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:22.619
about him a lot very fonds and intimate

01:56:22.619 --> 01:56:25.139
with him and he's the person that is

01:56:25.139 --> 01:56:27.600
lives in Germany psychotic

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.699
but he used to say the only difference

01:56:29.699 --> 01:56:31.619
between you

01:56:31.619 --> 01:56:35.480
and the stars is time

01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:45.600
is there a way to share this with my

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.179
crew Bonnie my small group

01:56:48.179 --> 01:56:50.100
um

01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:52.139
um the recording David

01:56:52.139 --> 01:56:56.639
yeah if anyone can share any recordings

01:56:56.639 --> 01:56:57.920
yeah

01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:00.540
I'm happy that you asked because

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.219
everybody should you just should have

01:57:02.219 --> 01:57:04.080
consent of everyone

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.179
because I don't think something like

01:57:06.179 --> 01:57:08.119
that happened today but sometimes

01:57:08.119 --> 01:57:12.800
sometimes these recordings get a little

01:57:14.159 --> 01:57:16.679
um what we don't do is don't share them

01:57:16.679 --> 01:57:19.320
in a way that they can go around social

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:22.320
media like

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:24.320
um

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:26.880
just ask people not to then all right

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:28.679
this would be a private group yeah and

01:57:28.679 --> 01:57:30.719
then they asked them not to share an

01:57:30.719 --> 01:57:34.159
opinion around social media

01:57:35.719 --> 01:57:39.239
but how do you share off the platform

01:57:39.239 --> 01:57:42.860
yeah just have them yeah

01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:45.659
exactly you got straight to Youtube It's

01:57:45.659 --> 01:57:47.940
unlisted it's not private

01:57:47.940 --> 01:57:50.400
so if you go off of sub stack just to

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.780
the YouTube

01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:53.820
does that make sense yeah they can just

01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:55.980
watch it on YouTube but what you don't

01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.900
want them to do is go on Twitter then

01:57:57.900 --> 01:58:00.179
and post post the YouTube

01:58:00.179 --> 01:58:02.159
they can then send it to someone else

01:58:02.159 --> 01:58:05.040
via email it just I don't want the link

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.400
to go on social media

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.679
right

01:58:10.679 --> 01:58:13.920
hey Bonnie how do we

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.440
um get you up to number one on sub stack

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.500
what's what's I don't know Sandy asked

01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:21.659
me like I don't even know I don't know

01:58:21.659 --> 01:58:24.179
what the criteria is Peter limber showed

01:58:24.179 --> 01:58:26.460
me that and then Sandy said well how do

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.139
they determine and I'm like

01:58:28.139 --> 01:58:29.650
I don't know because

01:58:29.650 --> 01:58:31.380
[Music]

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:33.800
so that's a good question you know

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.380
activity subscribers or whatever

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.599
uh but it'll be fun to be number one

01:58:39.599 --> 01:58:41.820
even if it's just you know for like a

01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:44.480
day or something

01:58:47.599 --> 01:58:51.119
let's do it so potential States exist in

01:58:51.119 --> 01:58:53.719
the universe

01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:55.860
thank you my friends it's a fantastic

01:58:55.860 --> 01:58:57.960
conversation

01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.239
um have a good day

01:59:00.239 --> 01:59:02.840
agree



## Cohort 5

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.880
okay

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.600
here we are

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.939
denim ultimate

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.240
word that starts with a P

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.740
uh interestingly

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.719
one time I was on a call with you know

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.820
one of these these call center people

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.399
and I was reading back a code tour and I

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.879
said p as in ptarmigen

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.739
what's this look

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.200
uh that didn't work

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.300
um

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.100
so what do we want to talk about today

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.280
uh we're at the second to the last

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.379
this is the second to the last of the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.479
first to the last this is the first to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.220
the last

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.400
session but I think usually we call it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.560
the second to the last right but if

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.240
you're second to the last or third in

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.619
line

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.260
this is very confusing these things are

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.659
very confusing to me today

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.880
oh yeah

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.439
um I'll have to ask Chad GPT about that

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.340
so it's an off by one error it's off by

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.520
one error exactly

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.820
this is the world we have to live in so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.600
confusing

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.540
um

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.320
which reminds me of a great video that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.479
I'll try to attach to the comments

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.939
section of this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.720
recap

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.659
um okay so it's a recap on what we've

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.240
been doing one of the things we can try

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.700
to do or I'll put out there I don't

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.460
think we necessarily could go out want

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.500
to go at it directly and this was the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.599
problem same problem we used to have in

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.459
my Master's course and toward the end of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.340
the Master's course we would do this one

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.819
session where

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.220
we would help each other like people

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.560
would complain like what I'm doing is

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.540
really great and every weekend I go home

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.700
and my husband says oh you know you can

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.500
see him all she jazzed up and he says oh

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.300
what are you been talking about and and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.700
as soon as I start to talk either it

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.200
sounds stupid

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.879
or I have nothing to say and so this is

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.519
not a problem for you to worry about

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.220
because it doesn't mean that whatever

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.980
we're talking about hasn't landed but it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.580
is a obstacle to spreading the word

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.900
right I mean you don't have to worry

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.760
about it in terms of your own self you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.099
know that something is in you and this

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.440
and that that's not what it's meant to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.180
be but there is this uh pernicious

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.180
obstacle uh

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.099
yeah

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.540
um so that's something we can play

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.120
around with and I only bring it in

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.540
because of it reminded me of the end of

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.120
the Master's classes but

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.360
um yeah but whatever whatever we want we

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.459
want to talk about

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.739
um

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.840
I totally agree with you I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.300
plant one of my friends on the zoom call

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.940
he said he might talk with you he

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.400
reviewed one of the meetings I don't

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.940
know if he ever did or or printed things

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.340
in but he asked me what does Bonnie said

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.819
this week I I couldn't come up with it

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.580
and I felt exactly the same way as hard

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.019
to describe

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.680
but I think the reviewing what he did of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.159
the possibly the last cohort

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.060
fourth maybe uh he said he really

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.700
had some questions uh obviously he would

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.680
but uh

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.000
uh

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.640
anyway I'm just agreeing with you

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.519
enough said go on no no I'll show you

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.959
something interesting

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.019
um

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.460
[Music]

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.020
my computer's slow today and understand

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.660
why it's just not right there hold on

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.440
here we come

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.960
all right

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.639
um here's something interesting that

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.320
uh

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.620
so can you all see this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.400
this is a um really cool

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.900
um

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.800
a really cool uh free online thing

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.340
called pod smart and it will take audio

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.580
recordings and you can upload them and

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.380
again then it does this meta summary so

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.840
this is the audio recording of our first

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.340
recap

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.460
and and the speakers delve into topics

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.259
related to organizing conversation

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.360
session writing processes body awareness

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.160
integration of digital Nomads they also

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.539
touching the costs at the apocal

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.340
technology addiction evolving

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.259
relationship too blah blah blah gives

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.820
you this meta summary

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.340
and then it organizes it into topics

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.020
uh this should be bolded

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.720
um

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.600
findability remember this those of you

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.580
that were there

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.580
um and then here's the transcript

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.600
um

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.900
and of course it makes certain mistakes

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.900
um

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.479
but in in the transcript but

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.380
um

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.600
and then it goes on and on and on and on

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.139
and on and on and on and then we have

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.139
number two is here and then that is

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.259
summary number two uh significance of

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.180
adding a naive perspective to a rowing

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.319
team if you remember that the

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.880
exploration of the feminine face of God

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.680
the challenge is faced by newcomers and

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.880
established groups the importance of

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.259
collective presence and feedback and

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.300
Leadership teams to transfer men of

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.520
power of dance and music personal growth

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.919
self-awareness I mean it makes you feel

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.979
like no one's over exhausted the episode

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.780
Begins by highlighting significance

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.840
adding more naive rowing team blah blah

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.699
blah power dance the Jewish woman

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.340
Shekinah the Texas integrating minded

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.199
body Torah within the speakers all this

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.539
challenge Vision newcomers we it goes

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.699
over and over authors experience a new

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.639
group in the role as a disrupter Shares

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.720
are reflecting their personal Journey

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.460
conclude Simplicity natural experience

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.560
profound and complexity on Highlights

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.720
emphasizes all this stuff and then here

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.240
are the it picks these out you know it

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.919
picks these titles up how New

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.780
Perspectives enthusiasm exploring the

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.220
meaning of Shekinah and the Torah don't

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.660
remember that unless it's been peeing

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.819
navigate getting group dynamics and

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:19.080
fresh perspective exploring

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.400
transformation and common goals

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.259
observations on Collective presence and

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:24.419
personal growth Exploring Creation

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:26.819
condescending and so one of the things

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.680
about this what I like is you could come

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.479
home all exhausted from one of these

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:33.660
weekends and just slap this document on

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.020
the table when they ask you like what

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.060
did you guys talk about you just slapped

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.039
this document so this is just two of

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.599
them and there's 58 pages in 25 800

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.220
words

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.319
um so

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.819
um

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:55.220
yeah so uh

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:01.940
that's that's one way to look at it

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.160
so many words so many words

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.900
well let me say this we didn't speak

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.460
that many words because it doesn't

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.199
matter summary and then it does a good

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.699
thing and then it does the transcript

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:26.639
but I'm I'm just saying

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.240
it can collect into a document because I

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.279
asked I asked it to do a long summary

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.159
which does all those all those things

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.260
actually the second one was a long

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.000
summary the first was a medium summary

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.479
the medium summary is better I think but

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:44.539
um

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.860
but it's an interesting way to relate to

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.779
you know the first the first person

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:54.480
experience of it

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.160
um

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.959
and I know we do these transcripts right

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:00.120
now but the this meta summaries and the

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.980
summaries are interesting because of the

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.980
way it

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.000
creates these topics you know that then

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.580
need to be unpacked so

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.600
that's interesting

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.260
what was the name of the tool that you

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.779
used to do that it's it's just called

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:25.260
pod smart dot AI it's either podsmart

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.060
ai.com or pods podsmart.ai

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.620
um

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.720
um

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.820
it's free until you start using it too

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.500
much then it's like nine dollars a week

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.480
or something but

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.260
um let me just say this if you use it it

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.339
it says it will use transcribe MP m4as

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:51.600
and and zoom gives you the audio in m4a

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.019
format but I always get an error message

00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:57.959
so I have to use a converter to convert

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.899
the m4a into MP3 and I'm not sure if

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.360
it's my system or they got a bug or

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.680
something

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.519
um

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:07.680
um so

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.140
um I I haven't it would be nice if you

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.600
could just drop the the zoom audio into

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.580
pod smart

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.279
um but for some reason in both attempts

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:19.680
like I tried three times in both

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.360
sessions and I couldn't get it to take

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.200
an M for it

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.640
I have a question about what you want

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.320
what we're going to do after this

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.420
there's one more session which I I'll

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.420
only partially be there for and then

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.300
what's the plan there's a summer off or

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.700
uh and then you're gonna do that other

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.899
course and then start something up again

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:47.940
or can you talk about that a little bit

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.399
Yeah so the other course doesn't really

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.860
have anything to do with this

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.959
um

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:57.060
you know with what we're doing here

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.339
um except that I like to make available

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:04.440
you know my deal when I do courses with

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.339
other other academies or other

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:10.680
institutions is that I get to make

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.660
available the recordings to the paid

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.360
subscribers of the pop-up school so it's

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.480
kind of an added benefit I know some of

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.579
you are going to be in the course which

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.560
is really cool because it's different

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.920
than we're doing here and I hope that

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.040
the Parallax type people who tend to be

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.860
more like digital Nomads and kind of

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.779
street smart and

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:37.500
a little more aggressive than we are uh

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.839
it's nice to have a different kind kind

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:42.000
of an audience you know and see how that

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.040
I am going to have a conversation with

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.380
David Kaley who is

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.839
um

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:52.560
lifelong friend and the biographer of

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.800
Ivan illit and if you've seen the course

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.000
content

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.399
I've set it up to be very pop of

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:00.540
school-like because I have these

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.000
provocations right like these things

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.760
that Ivan Elliott said that go against

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.240
the grain of what our community you know

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.560
Gaia I mean the certain communities

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.260
might really like how how can we be fans

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.540
of him and it yet he says these things

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.300
and ends with this great provocation

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.240
about well the Good Samaritan which we

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.700
know but this whole thing that he talked

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.680
about

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.839
uh God didn't become man he became and

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:34.620
fleshed right and this of course is a is

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.339
a

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:37.440
Prime pop-up thing so there's some

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.820
overlap but

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.160
and the and uh

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.620
um the the second the third module on

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.920
the communal self uh will be familiar to

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.320
you but again having I want to make it

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.760
more provocative depending upon who's

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.260
there and having a certain kind of edge

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.420
to it so

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.320
um that's running in uh every Sunday in

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.380
October uh September it's it said it

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.120
started on September 3rd but we pushed

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.440
it back one week because of David

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:10.019
Kaylee's schedule so now what we have uh

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:13.019
I'll share my screen again and what we

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:16.200
have coming here and then maybe we could

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.760
talk about this because I'm not quite

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.760
sure what to do is

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.200
um

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.139
everything we've been doing today I mean

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:27.779
this year is called background in other

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:30.300
words we needed to understand the pieces

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.339
quote unquote

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:35.639
um uh we needed to understand the pieces

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:38.279
in order to develop the new theory of

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:39.720
the body

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.579
and so

00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:43.639
um

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.839
uh

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:48.779
um this is the wrong screen

00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:52.160
um and where am I

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.920
uh yuck

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.980
okay okay so

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.040
um

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.740
so these so we're so part two is

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.339
developing this new theory of the body

00:14:08.339 --> 00:14:12.420
um and we need to start thinking of the

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.040
body not from a first personal

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.740
experience which is we use that to

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.820
understand our body but to figure out

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.800
the collective

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.279
aspect of the body to

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:29.579
um so September is just origins of the

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:32.880
body this we're going to talk about we

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.399
put the Mind back into the body during

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:37.620
the these sessions I'm going to try to

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.079
put the body back into nature and the

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:41.699
cosmos

00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:43.380
um

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.060
so

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.139
um

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:47.940
that

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.980
um

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.060
that that's that's what we'll do in

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.220
September now to October then now we

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.980
have to move into this human culture and

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.660
this notion of collective Consciousness

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.540
and a compound individual

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.959
um try to think of ourselves

00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:07.680
as uh in these collectivized senses

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.240
November we're going to talk about the

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.339
moral animal

00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:12.420
um

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.000
to figure out like

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.600
um

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.180
what is it ours to do in this in this

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.120
in this whole Collective body

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.000
um and then in December we'll talk about

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.180
individuation in the new human

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.040
um something forward-looking now I don't

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.899
know what the schedule should be I want

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:36.720
to do something different

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.959
um I have some ideas

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:44.880
um but what's tricky about this is

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.680
so many time zones so many different

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.300
schedules

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.360
um and it's and it's hard to

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.000
um accommodate

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.620
um

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.440
yeah so part of me wants to do like a

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.240
longer immersion but then there's fewer

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.959
times fewer times you meet and so you

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:06.180
have to try to hit a sweet spot which is

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.519
impossible given all the different

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:11.880
schedules and the time zones

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.459
in the pop-up school so

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:16.459
um

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.959
um I'm not sure

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:20.279
um

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:23.279
I'm not sure I'm not sure what the what

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:24.720
if it's going to be different than what

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.279
we've been doing just just kind of Shake

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:27.779
It Up

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:32.940
um but I'm not sure uh what it will

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.399
will look like yet I don't know any

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:39.380
suggestions what you're hungry for

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.459
I mean one thing go ahead oh I was just

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:53.279
gonna say I I found that um when we were

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.019
doing those like four postures and I

00:16:55.019 --> 00:16:57.420
know there was hesitancy to doing that

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.339
online but I found that really helpful

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:01.259
those were some really helpful sessions

00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:03.240
for me those um practicing those four

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.959
postures together

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:09.000
yeah we'll probably do more of that

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.799
stuff in the festival and less

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:12.780
presentation stuff and just because

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.640
that's I hear that a lot and so maybe

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.400
the whole festival will just do

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.079
um certain types of meditations or

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.179
practices

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:23.040
um

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.100
one of the things I'm thinking is to run

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.220
the

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.080
these these sessions it's all very

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.960
tricky to run these sessions more as

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.480
like each session

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.140
as a as a course

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.860
um so that people can can like okay the

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.140
first session I mean it's so cheap but

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.120
like

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.539
to promote each side each module as a

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.100
course Standalone course that would cost

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.080
somebody 40 bucks right to sign up for

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.080
the month and then maybe try to get some

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.980
more

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.100
um

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.780
some more engagement but the problem

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.160
with that is that a lot of people

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.020
haven't done any of the background work

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.740
and so it gets it gets

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.500
it gets to be difficult because

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.059
I tend to try to give

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.919
you know what will end up happening is

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:21.360
we'll just start making all the

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.120
distinctions that we made all year and

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.640
not getting to the to the meat of it

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.120
yeah Charlie

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.020
so

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.720
I uh I just wanted to say that I I came

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.120
in like I think more than halfway

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.580
through uh you know and only subscribed

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.799
to the pop-up school I think I'm not

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:43.020
even sure if it was April or May but so

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.820
I was just looking back at what I missed

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.960
and

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.679
um

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:51.720
that it's it's a lot even with just the

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.820
half that I got and I also haven't been

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.740
attending and you know I really

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.020
appreciate you making the effort to try

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.360
to hit such

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.000
sort of it's different than anything

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.980
I've ever engaged in because of the way

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.799
that all the times are so sort of all

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:09.900
over the place which I get why you do it

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.419
but what it means is that I'm just not

00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.460
able to attend every session because I

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.400
work full-time and um have a pretty full

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.940
life so I'm I'm very interested you know

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.100
as I was just looking back now I really

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.679
wish that I'd caught the affect one at

00:19:25.679 --> 00:19:28.080
the beginning but my psychiatrist had

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.660
pointed me towards Sylvan Tompkins and I

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.820
read a whole bunch of stuff you know a

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.419
year or so ago on that so I get it but

00:19:36.419 --> 00:19:40.860
um I'm personally finding that

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.860
it's just incredibly challenging like

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.260
every effort that I make to really tune

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.500
in to my own body is

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.539
sort of repulsed or repelled by I think

00:19:54.539 --> 00:19:58.020
my childhood experiences you know which

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.679
I won't go on

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.720
us you know uh trauma response so in any

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.360
case I just wanted to offer that there's

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.160
no real question or

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
um

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:20.220
yeah this is a design problem okay so we

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.799
get this right we get it from the sense

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:24.960
of the design problem

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.799
um and and again I offer a lot of time

00:20:28.799 --> 00:20:30.660
spots so different people can come in

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.520
but because many people come often then

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.740
if you come to the third time slot we've

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.360
already built

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.480
build capacity so that's I mean that's a

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.059
that's a good thing and one of the

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:48.620
things that I'm hoping we can do and

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.320
which is good about playing with this AI

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.200
is to turn this into

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.840
um like more conventional courses it's

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.700
it's the same it's true for like we have

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.039
all these like 9 500 free subscribers

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:03.960
and part of it is they're just

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.340
subscribers but part of it is that in no

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.860
way are they gonna you know they do they

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.260
have the time to spend

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:13.860
um

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.320
in the in the kinds of course courses

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.280
that that we do so could we have little

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.299
little mini courses on

00:21:24.299 --> 00:21:27.660
on on on just these modules

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.660
um

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:33.360
in a sort of popcorn pop of popcorn way

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.419
and how how to design to how to design

00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:38.220
that so

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.220
um if you remember I don't uh some of us

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.200
remember like

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.700
um

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.100
um Phoebe was having difficulty and I'm

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.539
like wait till we get to the imaginal

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:49.980
because that will be you know that's

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.260
where she shined and so in some sense

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.419
you could have people

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:56.400
um uh

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.260
um

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.419
you know pick what their their most

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.460
interested in

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.500
um but

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.760
um

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.179
yeah so this this question of pedagogy

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:12.539
and what to do with it and

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.220
um

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.740
and also you know there's a question I I

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.220
think of of some of you uh wanting to

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.780
host

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.900
um some some

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:30.120
some like novice uh sessions on some of

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.340
those modules you know

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.320
um there's a there's a huge number of

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.100
people who would like to be

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.320
participate that would like

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.980
um

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.460
it translated into to more kind of

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.539
concrete practical practical things

00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:50.340
um

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.559
yeah so you build a cohort like how many

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.720
people can meet on Thursdays at this

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.900
time and this is led by so and so and

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.440
and and it would be around the topic the

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.679
main topic would be one or two of the

00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:07.860
modules that say affect and something

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.320
else but

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.080
um the person hosting it will have

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.120
done all the backgrounds so they can

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.980
make distinctions like someone's going

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.020
to ask you when you're an athlete well

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.520
what is it what's the isn't that the

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.100
imaginal how do I know

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.780
um and

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.340
um

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.640
and so it's important to be able to

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.799
make those make those distinctions so

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:34.860
that's another thing I'm thinking about

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.419
um

00:23:36.419 --> 00:23:40.140
um like three weeks same time same place

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:45.059
around one topic and and then the fourth

00:23:45.059 --> 00:23:47.820
week maybe a couple of sessions where

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.100
everybody who have been doing the side

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.900
sessions

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.900
um can come together and ask me

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.480
questions or something like that and

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.039
if the teachers were there it would be

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:02.700
great because then they could clarify

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.380
you know sometimes people ask questions

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.059
you don't know really where it comes

00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:07.440
from and someone can say oh we were

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.960
talking about this and this was the gist

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.700
of it or something like that I mean

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.740
there's so much demand

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.760
um it's really the problem is how to

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.400
design something that doesn't ruin what

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.679
the pop-up school is

00:24:22.679 --> 00:24:24.480
um

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.760
but

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.640
um extends it so this is also

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.980
interesting because you know there are a

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.200
couple of organizations that would like

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.059
to

00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:39.179
um take over the public school and do

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:42.720
courses but then again it becomes very

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.020
course-like and and and not with the

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.000
pop-up School how the pop-up School

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.940
builds capacity so I don't know it's an

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.860
interesting question I mean these are

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.980
not unsolvable questions there's just

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.240
it's kind of like what do they call uh

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.179
when you have

00:25:03.179 --> 00:25:06.480
like it's like the curse of too much or

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.760
the the burden of a feast there's a

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.440
phrase for it like

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.799
the problem of having too many choices

00:25:13.799 --> 00:25:18.419
or uh too much richness or something

00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:21.059
so

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:23.340
um yeah and I love the fact Charlie that

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.140
people like you show up because it gives

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:29.039
us a bass line to notice the parameters

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:32.340
of what what doesn't work you know or

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.919
what is the threads that are cut you

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:37.740
know and then they're not in and the

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.380
question of every time like there's

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.179
other people like my friend eche right

00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:43.740
you all see her I've known her forever

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.260
she tries really hard and she's really

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.080
smart but she also knows that she she

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.419
has she's gonna ask a question that's

00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:53.520
been answered by this systematic

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.559
progress we've been making

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:58.620
and so this is someone like I know so

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.960
many people like that that

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.679
um

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:04.440
if if it could be more if they could

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.020
learn more on their own

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.840
um I'm not sure how that would happen

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.020
um without because you know because

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.700
you're not gonna actually learn things

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.360
by watching our video Recaps because

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.799
they're too

00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:22.679
um live in participatory so

00:26:22.679 --> 00:26:25.980
um these are interesting questions and

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.840
um

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.679
uh

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.760
I'm not sure how to

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:37.140
I'm not sure what which one has more

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.720
energy for me in the first place

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.760
and so I don't put a lot of energy into

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.340
if I if I could see one and ah this

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.960
really grabbed me then I would put in

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.960
energy into designing for it

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.880
um but right now I just see all these

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.640
this possibility and the lack of

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.700
uh the lack of uh Focus

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.320
um

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.799
and I'm I'm thinking of this the fall

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.720
courses this is like what we're going to

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.400
do in the fall is like a is a big deal

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.020
it's a big challenge yeah Claudia

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.080
yeah I was wondering whether

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.940
um you have plans to create some kind of

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.460
you know stand-alone

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.159
book or textbook on let's say the theory

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:24.600
of the body

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.740
um

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.260
like a textbook

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.140
um yeah that that could serve as a kind

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.360
of introductions with people

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.640
um There's Something About Books people

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.100
people sort of make the time a little

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.760
bit for books

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.740
yeah so

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.779
you know Jonathan Ralston has been very

00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:49.559
good uh every couple of months he asks

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:52.020
me how am I doing on the book

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.480
the book

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.279
um

00:27:56.279 --> 00:27:58.380
this has been a problem for me for a

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.820
long time first of all one of the

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.940
reasons why is because I you know I was

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.120
a landscaper and a horse person and I

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.740
read a lot of books but I'm not an

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.080
academic and I didn't have to write a

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.980
lot of papers and so there's it doesn't

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.520
come easy to me and then

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.580
um

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.380
as as I think

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.900
this is all kinds of justification I

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:25.860
guess

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.140
um but just more of describing my

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.120
journey rather than trying to justify it

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.279
and then like when I get onto something

00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:35.520
like my before Socrates series like that

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.539
was 140 Pages at the end of the day so I

00:28:39.539 --> 00:28:41.880
can sustain something

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.120
um I'm a little I'm a little

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.980
disappointed that I have more energy to

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.679
critique you know to make up things as a

00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:52.200
critique as I go along the way I noticed

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.700
that that uh

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:59.580
that is something I want to leave behind

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.840
um

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.159
but uh and I have hundreds and hundreds

00:29:05.159 --> 00:29:08.039
of pages of written on in one note about

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:09.840
different projects that could go into

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.279
this book

00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:15.000
um but I don't see

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.880
you see this is the problem with very

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.679
late stage if you want to call it that

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:24.020
cognition is that it's it's no longer

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.820
systematized I I don't

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.559
I don't

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.960
have two things they don't have a third

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.240
person perspective on myself and I can't

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.700
systematize my own work because I

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.899
basically

00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:41.100
am writing like I'm dancing entirely

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.940
free of my mind so so this is weird for

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.140
me because

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.480
when I used to run the landscape

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:50.399
operations and I used to take these

00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:52.020
tests like what you're really good at

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:57.360
for your for your uh kind of job like I

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.320
not only score way like at the top of

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.480
systemization

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.760
like women there's two there's scores

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.860
for women and men because women are less

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.140
systematizers I score the top one

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.320
percentile for men for systematization

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.299
and so

00:30:15.299 --> 00:30:18.179
um so

00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:20.299
um

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.919
so Jonathan's been helping me because I

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:24.480
send him all kinds of stuff and he's

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.820
helping me see it in a systemic fashion

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.620
you know and and trying to he's very

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.419
systematic you know and trying to find

00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:35.279
he keeps on telling me just right you

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:38.039
don't have to see the thread

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:40.080
um so

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.760
um so there's there's a couple of things

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.620
there's

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.220
um the new theory of the body

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.380
so right now what we're looking at is

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.200
not a huge textbook like a new Theory

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.360
the body although this AI I think can

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.559
help

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:58.320
um but a

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.899
um the the Project's called The Once and

00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:02.520
Future god

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.640
um perspective uh has pretty much

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.799
guaranteed they'll they will publish it

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:09.240
for me they're trying to get me to write

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.980
it and come into a publication date

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.559
there's a lot of pressure

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:15.480
um and

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.539
um

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.320
and it will contain it will be what

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.860
we're trying to do is take things like

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.539
um very complex potential States

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:29.940
cognition in the world the new theory of

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.260
the body

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.200
and see how they could be a collection

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.240
of essays

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.760
that are enveloped around this concept

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.980
of a one Once and Future God and then

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.399
like the last essay would be the ones

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:46.200
the once in future God right you can see

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.480
how that that works

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.020
um I I definitely agree that this is

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.740
necessary for me to do uh because then

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.779
you would get on all kinds of podcasts

00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:59.640
talking about the book and people will

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.140
have read the book so they will know how

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.919
to interview me which they don't

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:06.360
um

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.100
oh

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.100
but

00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:13.799
yeah

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:16.200
it's not that I don't want to do it and

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.120
I don't feel that I'm resistant to do it

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.919
and I write and I write it's just I

00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:21.779
can't see it from here to there and if

00:32:21.779 --> 00:32:24.419
you can't see it's very hard to

00:32:24.419 --> 00:32:26.399
accomplish it but this has happened to

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:30.419
me before and once you can see it

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:32.539
um

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.740
you know even like that book chapter in

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.240
the in the in the meta modern book

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.640
poor Jonathan you know I struggled with

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.520
it and this and that and I I declined to

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.200
do it twice

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.960
and it's a really great chapter you know

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.200
and I believe he says so and

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.640
um

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.220
yeah and so I just have to think of it

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.200
as writing a bunch of chapters and then

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:02.039
letting him help me uh

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:04.559
thread it in such a way it sounds like

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:07.200
it's in you know if it's all fits in the

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.899
same book I got plenty of stuff

00:33:09.899 --> 00:33:12.840
that's not the problem

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.600
but what happens is every time I do

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.679
research and I'm writing I'm like oh

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:22.679
I can use that and then I go back and

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:26.399
and I ping off everything so

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:29.100
um yeah so

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.320
this is I'm not arguing with you I'm not

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.720
trying to defend it I it's it's the

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.940
obvious thing to do

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.940
it's so obvious it's like duh but it

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.980
turns out to be

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:43.700
uh

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.340
not a case of linear cause and effect

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.220
someone suggested someone in the pop-up

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.059
School

00:33:51.059 --> 00:33:54.299
got in touch with this Ghost Writer

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:58.019
and it made me so mad like we have this

00:33:58.019 --> 00:33:59.640
ghost friend really she's really great

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.039
she could write so like there's

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:04.919
something there too like like I don't

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:09.060
know I'd rather you know uh because it

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:14.580
made me so mad in a funny way uh

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:19.440
it made me realize something you know

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.480
that I didn't want to do it

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.679
um

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.899
yeah Holly thanks for asking the

00:34:24.899 --> 00:34:25.980
question I don't know you have a

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.460
follow-up you can see I'm kind of

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.859
all over the place my only follow-up is

00:34:31.859 --> 00:34:34.399
to do with the theory of the body I mean

00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:36.899
and these theory of the body would kind

00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:38.280
of change everything

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.599
um you know like if you think about

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:42.780
education it's all based on a theory of

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.580
the human a theory of

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.859
who we are and if we've got that wrong

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.760
um

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.679
and if we you know if we've got richly

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.080
you know we have a new Theory could

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:56.099
really

00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:59.220
clarify new education you know I'd love

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.040
kids to do this course

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.619
yeah so this is what happens to me and

00:35:04.619 --> 00:35:06.000
maybe you can help me and then I know we

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.940
have two hands raised so I start I said

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.640
the same thing I'm like okay

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.040
let me coming off this course let me

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.480
write a new theory of the body I got all

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.740
this course content okay then I start

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.599
and I think I start to make a sentence

00:35:21.599 --> 00:35:23.579
and then I'm like well of course I have

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:25.680
to bring jungling in and of course this

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.540
person said that and then there's Katie

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.040
Lang said that about the Divide itself

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.500
and I st and then and then it's like

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.680
then it's like

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.280
all this you know this kind of academic

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.320
sort of contextualizing it comes in and

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.660
and then I realized okay you know this

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.520
is going to turn into Ian mcgilchrist

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.619
thing I'm not capable of a sustaining

00:35:49.619 --> 00:35:52.320
this kind of energy over ten thousand

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:57.720
pages and so then I just say like like

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.640
what would you just put the Mind back in

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.440
the body in the body back into nature

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.260
and that phrase

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.060
stands in for all of that and like so

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.599
I'm I'm stuck between the simplest

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:11.880
caricature of what I'm doing and this

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:15.060
other thing that happens so it's it's

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.440
about

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.540
it's about

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.540
how to start without

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.280
feeling

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.280
that

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.720
you know this situation situate these

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.040
things but when you're writing a book

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.599
you do I don't know

00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:35.700
I totally agree with you and then the

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.680
organism goes like that

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.599
children's book yeah

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:43.920
um that would that would be for someone

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.079
else to write I think

00:36:46.079 --> 00:36:48.300
um you know if I see this as a thing if

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.460
I had that book then people could do all

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.339
these other these other things but I

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:56.540
think I'm getting there yeah

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.300
Holly

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.619
yeah I mean I just wanted to offer some

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.700
feedback

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.040
um I mean all of your writing is really

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.500
for me phenomenal but some of the more

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.180
profound pieces were

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.339
your dispatches from Maple like where

00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:13.140
you were interweaving a personal

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.960
experience in with with the theory so

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.599
that the two are meeting

00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:21.180
um so that really personal element

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.200
um

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.820
I just remember those pieces really

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.640
having a really profound impact

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.619
and and then also thinking like you know

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:29.880
you're writing you're writing for the

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.140
future that's that's often what I'm

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.339
thinking about when I read your stuff

00:37:32.339 --> 00:37:35.400
it's like this is for like when you're

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.320
when you're gone and we're all gone you

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.540
know people are gonna people it's like

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.280
you're kind of ahead of your time and

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.020
it's gonna take time I think for people

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:44.280
to

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.020
to catch up

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.339
um but your work is going to be there

00:37:47.339 --> 00:37:50.280
and um what I what I really love too

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.099
about the sub stack is that it allows it

00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:55.680
allows all of us to participate in the

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.119
pieces as well

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.980
so I think of those as like it's like a

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.480
living Canon that you're creating a

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.180
library that you're creating and and we

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.099
get to participate in that with comments

00:38:05.099 --> 00:38:07.020
and with um responses and then you

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.780
respond back and so the future will get

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.260
to see kind of the real time responses

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.880
and dialogue that's being created from

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.460
the pieces versus a book you know where

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.079
you're it's kind of static and you're

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:21.240
not getting to see how the community is

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.380
participating and co-creating the work

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.359
um so anyways I just wanted to offer

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:29.160
that that feedback because

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:29.940
um

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.000
uh yeah I also a lot of times my mind

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.859
goes is how how is how are the future

00:38:34.859 --> 00:38:36.359
generations going to be receiving this

00:38:36.359 --> 00:38:38.540
work

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.300
yeah thank you for that Jonathan is very

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.099
generous he's generous he says the same

00:38:44.099 --> 00:38:46.320
thing he's like what you we want you

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.720
know he wants to write

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.619
um

00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:51.599
though he's like that people want to get

00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.520
to nobody you know like they want the

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:58.500
abstract and stuff like and and

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:02.520
you know like like I can't tell you what

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.839
it feels like you know that story I've

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:05.520
told a million times like my mother

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.320
taught me to pray and I'm like a mess

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.020
like why when I sit down and write that

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.940
it's like this is like the stupidest

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.520
thing like it's like I don't have a

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:18.720
voice for it like like uh now if it can

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.300
come out in a sub stack like that but

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.740
but

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.660
and and I think like you're absolutely

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.700
like right like one of the reasons why I

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.400
can write for the pop-up school is this

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.020
problem I have with not having a third

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.180
person perspective and then you you guys

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.300
are like instead of an inner monologue I

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:39.540
have this right in the in the real world

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.579
um and

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:42.480
um

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.619
and

00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:45.480
um and I have my elves at night I can

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.020
tell when I sometimes I wake up with new

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.579
material and I don't know I'm I'm

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:52.320
working at it but

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.440
um uh

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.020
um

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.800
yeah so that that process is very

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.780
generative for me

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.619
um

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:07.079
and uh

00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:09.240
the thing about Maple like I came back

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.940
from the last Maple thing which was

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:16.020
kind of chaotic and and really

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.339
um

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:19.740
had a lot more motivation to write this

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.359
because I'm like there were so many

00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:24.359
people that that really are would want

00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:26.579
want like you said documents and

00:40:26.579 --> 00:40:29.339
alternative ways to organize thoughts

00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:31.740
and stuff like that so

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.900
um I I felt that there would be outside

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.180
of the people in the pop-up School other

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.460
people some other people would read such

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.500
a thing you know

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.839
um how did it be able to write those I'm

00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:44.940
curious for you like those dispatches

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.740
what was that oh the dispatches were

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.260
great I mean because I was under this

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.660
foul of a wonderful experience and

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.880
wanted to share that

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:54.480
um

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.400
and

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.720
um uh

00:41:00.839 --> 00:41:03.780
yeah but you know

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.820
I was in I was in a certain

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.099
dispositional state where it was like

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:11.400
being high you know

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.040
um and I'm not fortunately not Pi like

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.119
I was like

00:41:18.119 --> 00:41:19.980
I don't know what to do I try and I

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.200
tried I went back

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.220
it was horrible

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.260
so uh it's not based on just place

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.300
the place was falling apart

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.619
but um

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:37.520
Sandra

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.260
you know I've been pondering

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.680
your

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:50.220
Insight guide pedagogy and I think part

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.060
of

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.099
um

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:56.099
part of why I spend so much time trying

00:41:56.099 --> 00:41:59.760
to diagram and draw and do this figure

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.720
out the thing put the puzzle together

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.500
um

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.720
is because I do want to translate

00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:12.359
my sort of a combination of my

00:42:12.359 --> 00:42:16.079
experience but also there's something so

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:18.599
deep and rich in what you're doing

00:42:18.599 --> 00:42:21.420
and you it

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.380
it's it's the difference between

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.800
sort of the spoon-fed version of it and

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.680
the Insight version of it

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.260
and

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.740
somewhere there's a spoon-fed version

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.780
that's

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.700
um that's probably not the right term

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.740
but somewhere there's there's a there's

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.780
a version

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.599
that people could actually walk around

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:51.859
in and try on

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.940
that's different than your writing and

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:01.920
this the sustenance of the pop-up School

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.380
and I don't know if it's actually for

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.599
you to write that Bonnie I think it's

00:43:06.599 --> 00:43:09.140
maybe for

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.720
you know the dialogue that happens on

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.240
sub stack or it's maybe it comes from a

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.079
different

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:20.339
a different place or it comes from

00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:23.940
maybe sitting and interviewing you but

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.520
not the way that we did it Ray and

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.920
um Marie's house maybe a a much

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:33.420
different more free form less

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.560
um

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.000
I don't know that felt like

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.660
interrogation to me somehow not not an

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.460
interview

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.240
um

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.780
so I think it

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.819
it's something we can work on together I

00:43:47.819 --> 00:43:50.339
mean I think it's something

00:43:50.339 --> 00:43:52.859
that you don't have to be the lone

00:43:52.859 --> 00:43:54.240
writer

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.200
trying to please Academia

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.020
there's something much more

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.020
um

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.740
basic

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.700
in the experience that you're offering

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.079
that

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:13.200
doesn't have to be a thousand footnotes

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.260
and Ian mcgilchrist

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.540
and I understand the rabbit holes I mean

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.940
I get that that should be genuine and

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.859
that should be this and oh I have to

00:44:22.859 --> 00:44:25.260
bring in this person oh there's David

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.460
Hinton and there's you know I get that

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.359
um

00:44:30.359 --> 00:44:33.420
and at the same time

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.420
I think there's just a very distilled

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.280
version

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.859
that would not be such a struggle

00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:42.180
and

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.940
I'll jump in with you any anything yeah

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.099
no no I agree agree with you like

00:44:47.099 --> 00:44:48.540
there's definitely a thread there like

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:51.599
I'm not I'm not worried that there's

00:44:51.599 --> 00:44:54.619
that that

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:56.640
because there's definitely a thread

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.440
there we see it all the time then once

00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.880
you get into the third then you realize

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.280
oh three months ago we were doing that

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.319
from it you know you can see that there

00:45:04.319 --> 00:45:07.619
so that's I'm not worried about that you

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:10.280
have to impose some kind of thread over

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.800
these disparate things

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.140
um and I don't want to go meta and say

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.060
and and figure out what that threat is

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.900
this is an impossible like the next Ken

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.880
Wilbur can do that or something and you

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.819
just get one of these crazy models right

00:45:26.819 --> 00:45:28.740
um but

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.920
um although uh quite often ask chat pt4

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.800
I have a really someone bought me a

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.020
subscription to a really good thing

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.400
that's in the whole nother thing we'll

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.260
talk about that but

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.760
um uh

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.720
the word that comes to mind is peacock

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.740
uh you have to be to write a book uh to

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.420
sustain the energy write a book you have

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.280
to be you have to channel your internal

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.380
peacock

00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:00.119
um and I unders I know that energy and I

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:03.000
you can't force it but I'm I The Closer

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.160
I Get to

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.619
we're envisioning the book The more then

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:09.540
that nlg will come up and then I'll be

00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.640
able to write the book and I'm not

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.200
afraid that it's not going to come up

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.060
because I have this thing the inner

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.619
peacock's got to come out you know and

00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:18.000
then

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.839
um

00:46:18.839 --> 00:46:20.880
and the inner peacock just wants to show

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.819
off like like I know how to do that uh

00:46:23.819 --> 00:46:25.980
everything they know and this is what

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.780
we're doing and

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.300
um yeah the inner Peak now the Gap flies

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.800
got to die

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.540
um for this book

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:40.079
um the gadfly is much more uh uh

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.680
is much more enthusiastic about running

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.319
the show than the the peacock

00:46:46.319 --> 00:46:49.440
um and well the paint the godfly used to

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.420
see this thing the gadfly was the

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.940
peacock right like the godfly likes to

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.260
Peacock

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:58.079
um and I and and I just need to like

00:46:58.079 --> 00:47:01.560
peacock the peacock and let the godfly

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.980
buzz around somewhere else so yes these

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.500
these these things make sense

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.819
um

00:47:08.819 --> 00:47:13.020
so that is uh you could have a theory of

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.540
why that's true blah blah blah women I

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.520
don't want to get into that but it is

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.240
what it is and so how to peacock without

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.460
uh to give it a peacock energy from

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.280
somewhere else that's not the godfly is

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.380
the question

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:33.119
um so uh the peacock

00:47:33.119 --> 00:47:37.319
um and if the peacock comes out

00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:40.140
like the dispatches I don't think I

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.599
could sustain that it could be one it

00:47:42.599 --> 00:47:45.660
could be one essay in a in a collection

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:51.060
of essays uh that level of personal

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.560
um

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.480
yeah you could tell this comes from a

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.980
different place

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.760
um but

00:47:59.099 --> 00:48:00.359
um

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:02.400
yeah this is an interesting conversation

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.200
just for the record book like the

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.660
certain challenges and

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.859
um

00:48:07.859 --> 00:48:10.640
uh

00:48:17.579 --> 00:48:20.760
yeah the peacock is is got a lot of it's

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.520
got to come from arrows that's the

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.859
peacock and it's got to be the peacock

00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:29.160
not the what's the female the the

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.260
collective is p foul and then there's a

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.060
peacock they don't call it the P hen

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.720
can't be a p hen the P hen

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.940
um the P Heng does not want to write a

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.060
book

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:54.180
nobody goes around saying I want to buy

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.400
a peahen

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.940
foreign

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.160
s felt like they had that peacock that

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.619
Arrow Synergy yeah even the dispatchers

00:49:04.619 --> 00:49:06.900
they had arrows but it was peacock era

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.200
energy to write really you really need

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.280
to have

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.680
see the feminine I I talked about this

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.060
once

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:17.099
um you have to understand this in the

00:49:17.099 --> 00:49:20.220
right way because you know that I don't

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:22.020
usually talk about feminine and

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.760
masculine

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:27.960
but when I work with women a couple of

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.660
women I've had consultations with that

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.440
are like their leaders and their

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:37.020
feminine leaders uh if it's a serious

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.940
conversation I get to the point where I

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.400
ask them to consider that feminine uh

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.380
leadership withdraws

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.260
you can't see it

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:49.140
um I think this is actually the case

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.540
it's certain historically the case you

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.880
can't one of the reasons why we know a

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.040
lot about

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:58.440
patriarchal rituals and systems is

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.200
because they peacock they leave they

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.540
leave a lot of evidence

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.640
um but

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.780
um

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.000
this and I teach this thing called Yen

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.140
leadership and Leadership withdraws you

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.940
withdraw

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.119
you withdraw from the the space you're

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:19.800
standing in and someone comes there and

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.980
then you withdraw again and it it's it's

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.619
and when you withdraw

00:50:25.619 --> 00:50:29.700
is kind of like you know so these levels

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.940
um you're you're you're

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.300
building up leadership in the other but

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.720
you're always withdrawing right in and

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.560
and eventually you disappear so the

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.160
mother for Oregon though you know didn't

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.599
write anything

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:52.619
but most people believe that orbindo was

00:50:52.619 --> 00:50:54.720
just channeling their mother and he

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.640
didn't understand his own writing right

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.400
and so this is why it's very hard to

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.000
understand or window because this he was

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.300
peacocking for the mother and

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:06.960
um

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.800
and one of the things to remember about

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:15.540
uh this is it takes a huge amount of

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:22.079
uh understanding of the power of uh

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:22.980
um

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.880
being powerful and never being seen

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.940
um is a is a feminine is truly if all

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.980
this other aggressive feminism is is a

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.540
confusion

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:37.220
um it requires it requires a huge

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.559
understanding of

00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:43.380
um so you you see why this I don't mean

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.220
never being seen and and you're pushed

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.500
away to this but it's not the point the

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.680
point is how to understand power that

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.119
withdraws and of course

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.839
um yeah so so anyways that's just a long

00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:03.359
thing why the PN won't write a book but

00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:05.700
you have to channel the peacock uh the

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.359
peacock wants you know more than wants

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.859
to be seen

00:52:10.859 --> 00:52:15.480
um and this is uh yeah so this is

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.160
interesting

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.220
um

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.819
it's an interesting

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:27.740
um way of looking at it

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:31.380
see the powerful Yin wants to withdraw

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:35.040
in the uh yielding so you know there's

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.319
there's powerful young and there's weak

00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:39.180
young and there's powerfully in in

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:45.119
weekend and uh week young wants to it

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:47.640
wants to Peacock

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:51.059
now powerful young wants to Peacock and

00:52:51.059 --> 00:52:53.700
Powerful Yin wants to withdraw and weak

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.640
Ian wants to Peacock

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.640
so they become like sexual symbols and

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.920
Powerful Yin wants to withdraw so

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.839
there's both yielding and creative

00:53:03.839 --> 00:53:05.220
forces

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.319
and so

00:53:07.319 --> 00:53:09.380
um

00:53:13.079 --> 00:53:15.680
that's why uh

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.900
Whatchamacallit got it wrong David Dade

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.220
when he talks about the female wants to

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:26.220
be seen by the gays of the male this is

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.099
not true they're masculine peacocks and

00:53:29.099 --> 00:53:31.980
we know this from Gay Culture that they

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:35.760
peacock much much more strongly than

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.440
women do this is an inversion really

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.640
um

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.819
which is fine because women should be

00:53:44.819 --> 00:53:48.480
able to Peacock if they want to also but

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.020
yeah

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.980
why are we talking about this

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.819
because it could be

00:53:56.819 --> 00:53:59.460
so that you'll write your book yeah so

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.700
okay

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.660
write my book

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.339
exactly it's very Taoist

00:54:20.339 --> 00:54:21.000
um

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.599
that's why the what you something about

00:54:24.599 --> 00:54:28.619
the Yang but stick with the yin which is

00:54:28.619 --> 00:54:30.780
yeah go ahead

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.400
I mean I

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.040
I guess I'm

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.319
since the beginning I think I've been in

00:54:37.319 --> 00:54:40.800
this wondering about

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.920
um

00:54:44.099 --> 00:54:45.900
how to

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.920
how to make this accessible to the

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.079
people you go home to without slapping

00:54:52.079 --> 00:54:53.280
the

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.119
um

00:54:54.119 --> 00:54:58.380
pod smart summary on the on the table I

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.559
mean I think that's then

00:55:01.559 --> 00:55:04.500
a question for me

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.880
um

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.480
so that I I do find

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.720
the language here coming into my own

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.780
work I do find ways that the the

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.599
metaphors and the imagery works

00:55:18.599 --> 00:55:21.500
and then

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.380
could it be could there be a version

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.780
that would be sort of paint by number

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.819
for some people

00:55:29.819 --> 00:55:32.400
who just

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.680
even want to take a step in this

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.660
direction

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.700
um

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.859
and that you know that may not be at all

00:55:40.859 --> 00:55:42.900
your job to do Bonnie that may be our

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.440
job to do

00:55:46.559 --> 00:55:49.800
numbers is is

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.900
um needs to be done I don't think that's

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.660
yeah that's not what I'm going to do

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.940
um who's my audience for this book let's

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.520
say this is very helpful

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.619
um you know people like you obviously

00:56:01.619 --> 00:56:06.900
but it would just be recapping but um

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.119
somebody won't be paint by numbers is

00:56:09.119 --> 00:56:10.500
because the audience would be like the

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.140
people I meet at Maple and these like 22

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.780
to 45 year olds they don't need Paint by

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.020
numbers they wouldn't repaint by numbers

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.760
there are a whole bunch of like people

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.200
that

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:24.260
um

00:56:25.079 --> 00:56:27.839
um if you read Peter lindberg's sub

00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:31.079
stack less foolish this is paint by

00:56:31.079 --> 00:56:34.140
numbers I would say so and and there's

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.839
you know huge community that he holds

00:56:36.839 --> 00:56:38.339
very well

00:56:38.339 --> 00:56:41.700
um that you won't see a lot of the

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.460
phrases I use there but it's like is the

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.040
is the view coming from

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.720
um what would you know the kind of shift

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.119
in view that we have here

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:55.200
um and uh and

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:57.059
um

00:56:57.059 --> 00:56:59.640
yeah it would once you get to paint by

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:02.040
numbers it it it's occluded you know you

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.900
paint by numbers doesn't mean use my

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.500
phrases and then I start by

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.700
demanding that you have a specific

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.859
language so we can talk to each other

00:57:10.859 --> 00:57:12.119
but

00:57:12.119 --> 00:57:15.960
um I think that that happens and

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.880
um

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.059
um

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.440
yeah like we were talking about when we

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.740
were at that that course in

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:27.960
um Socrates you know like you have to

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.359
you can't you can't be uptight when you

00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:32.460
it's obvious that people are building a

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.319
community around your work but they're

00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:36.359
using their paint by number systems and

00:57:36.359 --> 00:57:37.740
they're not citing you and stuff like

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:39.119
that

00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:41.220
um so that's cool

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:41.940
um

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.339
because the frustration around that

00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:46.619
really is if I if I feel frustrated

00:57:46.619 --> 00:57:48.240
around that it really comes from the

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:50.520
fact that I yet again haven't written my

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.800
book right so

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.020
um that's really where the the energy of

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:56.880
frustration should come from now because

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.440
other people are

00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:01.640
doing stuff with it

00:58:01.859 --> 00:58:03.000
but

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.480
um yeah Claudia

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.099
yeah we have a project at the moment

00:58:08.099 --> 00:58:10.020
where we've asked

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.960
some guy Andrew merman who knows a lot

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.460
about the UK

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.520
University system and we've just asked

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:21.540
him to write a report whatever feedback

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:22.800
on

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.660
how easy difficult it would be to get

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.000
ecological economics

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.700
into the university

00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:32.400
but and you know I think we've defined

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.200
ecological or economics deeply enough

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.559
I'm not sure probably not but

00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:39.359
um

00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:41.460
you know this is still sort of operating

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.920
on the hope that the existing kind of

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.040
educational institutions

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.260
you know aren't totally right

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:52.799
that they can somehow

00:58:52.799 --> 00:58:54.540
and in different countries it might be

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:57.180
different but somehow accommodate a

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:59.180
different way of of

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:03.780
that's yeah about the education okay

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.280
um or maybe I should say it more

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.559
strongly can shift quite rapidly let's

00:59:07.559 --> 00:59:09.119
say

00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:10.500
um

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.480
so yeah we'll see what the report says

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:13.740
whatever

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:15.960
um but

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.380
yeah what's your thoughts on influencing

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.839
current

00:59:20.839 --> 00:59:24.420
mainstream whatever educational uh the

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.160
the the the mainstream educational

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.339
system maybe at different pages

00:59:29.339 --> 00:59:32.099
yeah so this is a great question we will

00:59:32.099 --> 00:59:34.079
talk about this more kind of thing more

00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:36.900
in The Parallax course but it's very

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.180
important to understand two things and

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.460
then I and Magdalena I think this is up

00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:42.839
your alley too

00:59:42.839 --> 00:59:44.160
and then

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.619
um and the two things are this number

00:59:46.619 --> 00:59:49.079
one is

00:59:49.079 --> 00:59:52.980
the human system is extremely stratified

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.900
there's people at the bottom and there's

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.339
people at the top

00:59:56.339 --> 00:59:58.859
you have to understand that this is the

00:59:58.859 --> 01:00:00.780
case and it's going to be the case for

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.280
many generations to come because

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.819
Generations can't change that fast so

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:07.500
this is very important

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.299
but the second thing is to understand

01:00:09.299 --> 01:00:12.119
that the people who are most important

01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:15.119
are not at the top

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:17.760
some of them might be and and probably

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.299
not at the very bottom and the uh and

01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:24.079
and so you need a system to understand

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:27.059
that the human system is stratified and

01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:30.480
to identify those with the most promise

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.700
it's not an egalitarian thing because

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.599
we're not egalitarian it's just not true

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:39.240
right now right then but it's also not

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.960
true that the privileged Elites aren't

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.960
the ones we're looking for

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.960
you have to say what is the stratifying

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.400
thing along the metrics I'm looking for

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.559
is it a kind of Consciousness I talk

01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:59.099
about like the the this new mind is

01:00:59.099 --> 01:01:02.400
latent in the system already some people

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.220
have it to one degree or another and

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.460
some people don't and that's

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.339
who you want to design like new

01:01:11.339 --> 01:01:14.640
education systems for and this is so the

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.740
hardest thing is identifying what is

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.720
that metric what is what am I looking

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.960
for it is it is a hierarchy it is a

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.880
metric

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.460
um and so we don't care so much that

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:27.960
there's privilege at least going to

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.640
college because they're not the one

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.440
there might be some there but they're

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.780
not it's not the same

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.540
ordinary way we think about how Society

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.760
is stratified

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.440
and so

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.540
um now developmental stage story

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.040
actually grew out of this kind of urge

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.680
to see you know they were everybody's

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.920
like hooked on Wilbur and to see what is

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.740
the new mind but because their stage

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.460
theorists they look at it on top of all

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.920
these other stages and I'm saying that

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.660
it's orthogonal like it can look deviant

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:10.700
and um but it is it is

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.940
comes to terms with like as Ivo said

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.559
last time you know the Relentless

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:18.839
unfolding of reality we lived in a

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:21.359
stratified uh

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:24.119
um highly stratified human system in

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:26.880
terms of capacities for doing this kind

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.079
of work

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:32.220
and how can we identify

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.319
um we can't be a hundred percent correct

01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:37.020
and is latency like something can look

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.000
deviant for a long time but how can we

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.460
do design for that and then and still

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.460
and then the responsibility

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.819
to design you know keep designing for

01:02:47.819 --> 01:02:51.180
more and more of the the collective

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:54.900
um so does that make sense does it does

01:02:54.900 --> 01:03:00.180
it helpful like like so so this this

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.640
and and so some educational institutions

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.640
have to so this is the upshot some don't

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.980
need to be changed that much because

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.859
there's a huge group of people that

01:03:10.859 --> 01:03:12.540
aren't for the future they're not

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.280
they're not they're not they're not

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:17.480
going to make it to the Future

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.559
um and there's a there's some people

01:03:19.559 --> 01:03:22.140
that are already from the future

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.579
um and that's just the truth if you

01:03:23.579 --> 01:03:25.440
start thinking about it as designing

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.839
like from public Mass education you're

01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:30.059
going to hit the mark on all ends of the

01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:32.460
spectrum and that's what happens now

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.559
right so so you have to kind of be

01:03:37.559 --> 01:03:40.319
out of fashion in terms in in one sense

01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:43.500
in the in the in the conversation

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.359
um and and

01:03:45.359 --> 01:03:48.780
uh but but you understand that it is the

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:53.220
most uh any the long-term goal is more

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.319
egalitarian because you'll get there

01:03:55.319 --> 01:03:57.180
faster

01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:58.440
um

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.540
does that make sense

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:02.400
put those how do you put those two

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.599
things together Sandra

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.780
I just read a book called the future of

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.579
children

01:04:11.579 --> 01:04:18.420
and it's it it's a 40-year experiment

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.260
um

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.299
with a that started as a free school in

01:04:23.299 --> 01:04:26.339
1971 and

01:04:26.339 --> 01:04:28.440
based on

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.760
loving children and demonstrating that

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.540
children who love are loved and learned

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.660
to love the Earth will protect it and

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:42.540
defend it and grow into adults

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.839
who have that

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:48.000
new kind of mind that you're talking

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.480
about it's it's not it's somewhat based

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.059
in a developmental model but not in the

01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:56.700
way that we think about progress

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.299
um

01:04:57.299 --> 01:05:00.059
more in the way that we think about

01:05:00.059 --> 01:05:02.180
process

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.640
and so you know

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.420
the stories in it are stories of what

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.220
these kids were like as children and who

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.319
they turned into as adults

01:05:13.319 --> 01:05:15.500
and it

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.000
you know there's just a tremendous

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.339
amount of Hope in that

01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:23.640
potential even if it's a small scale

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.520
experiment

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.460
that yields the kind of results that

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.980
that they're talking about and

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.020
you know the person who was a director

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.579
at the school was a student of

01:05:35.579 --> 01:05:38.400
Buckminster Fuller and they had ROM Doss

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.200
come and they had you know Native

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.980
American people come they had just

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.880
a whole progression of

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.980
um learning

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.280
that's the kind of learning that we

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.200
actually need

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.299
and I think the question that it raises

01:05:57.299 --> 01:05:59.339
for me is how to

01:05:59.339 --> 01:06:02.160
you know I I'm thinking like you Claudia

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.559
is there like some way to influence

01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:06.780
what's already there or is it better to

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.160
just

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.460
begin these little

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:15.000
pockets of experimentation

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.900
um

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.900
and it's not an either or I guess

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.319
yeah

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.520
yeah it's not it's about not being

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.920
ideological on either end of the

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.480
spectrum

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.500
um

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.319
and so

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:33.960
of course you know if you're if you're

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.260
running projects like Claudia is

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.319
um it's very hot people want

01:06:40.319 --> 01:06:44.099
want to to get to an ideology and then

01:06:44.099 --> 01:06:48.359
one and done and and um but but if

01:06:48.359 --> 01:06:51.240
you're yourself an ideological you can

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:56.280
try to support or juggle many different

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.599
you know

01:06:57.599 --> 01:07:00.480
many different initiatives and some of

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.260
them are more conservative

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:06.299
than others at the same time knowing

01:07:06.299 --> 01:07:08.400
that there's this other this other thing

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.400
this other thing going on

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.520
um

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.559
and as long as we can continue to have

01:07:16.559 --> 01:07:21.180
successful experiments and curiosity and

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:22.559
um

01:07:22.559 --> 01:07:25.500
the interest to experiment in if as long

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.020
as that's in the human system then when

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.740
it hits the sweet spot you know

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.020
the same the same thing that makes

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.119
people want to just have an ideology and

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.339
have it work if one of these experiments

01:07:38.339 --> 01:07:41.400
works and and

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.079
um

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:45.539
it's easier then you then you get mass

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:48.359
mass adoption of it and then you'll be

01:07:48.359 --> 01:07:50.880
looking at the next thing but

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.720
um

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.940
the fact that people are lazy you know

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.140
they like water they're going to run

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.359
downhill to the to the easiest thing and

01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:59.700
then that becomes the thing you invented

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.799
becomes a little ideological as long as

01:08:01.799 --> 01:08:05.220
it changes people's behavior then then

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.160
that's good right so

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.760
song

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:14.400
it reminds me of you know that I

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.140
subscribe to this video channel where

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:17.640
this woman

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.040
um she she gets called in and she saves

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.380
bees you know like that there's bees in

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.600
your garage or bees and she does

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.460
everything with her bare hands and she's

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:30.120
really sweet voice and

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.060
as she's moving the comb into a new Hive

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.859
and this and that and she's so gentle

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:37.020
she's always looking for the queen bee

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.400
because once she gets the queen in the

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.620
clip and she puts it in right and so

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.839
that's what it is like once once you

01:08:42.839 --> 01:08:46.319
find the the queen of the you know the

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:49.560
queen educational approach and you put

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.400
it in this still be there'll be a swarm

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.739
right and

01:08:55.739 --> 01:08:58.319
um the challenge for people to be from

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:01.020
the future and metacognitive or do these

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.880
weird things and you know the problem

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.679
with doing these alternative things is

01:09:04.679 --> 01:09:07.080
to not you don't succeed in society in

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.779
the conventional way and blah blah blah

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:12.179
um but it's like this queen bee like

01:09:12.179 --> 01:09:14.819
just insert the queen bee

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:16.799
um shift the queen bee from here to

01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:20.580
there and and give the masses a little

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.580
smoke so you know and then

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:27.420
they'll go Magdalena

01:09:28.739 --> 01:09:29.900
um

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.940
it's not gonna be

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.520
you know it's gonna be pretty erratic

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.839
because

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.239
I think one of the things just nothing

01:09:39.239 --> 01:09:41.580
new I mean Zach's starting to talk about

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.400
it and lots of people talked about it I

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.420
mean that

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.480
what is already manifesting

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.839
is is is

01:09:50.839 --> 01:09:54.179
kind of all these

01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:57.840
you know uh

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.739
I mean really Insanity I mean it's

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:04.800
already like so widespread I mean even

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.060
in my whatever small circle within a

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.440
week

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.620
there was a mother who lost a 22 year

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:16.260
old to something that was spiked with

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:19.380
fentanyl I mean this is not like

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:22.560
somebody who is in drugs or whatever you

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.840
know I mean what do you say to this

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.020
person you know and and the only thing I

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.659
could come up with was your son's a

01:10:30.659 --> 01:10:33.679
casualty of a war

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.460
like this is not your fault because it

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.900
is not something you could have done

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.080
um

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.239
but there is a war

01:10:45.239 --> 01:10:47.840
against

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.219
subsistence

01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:54.659
I mean at at a very basic level

01:10:54.659 --> 01:10:56.580
and the subsistence is not just

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:00.000
subsistence of what you eat or what roof

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.880
you have over your head it's

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.360
um an automatized

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:10.800
Dynamic that makes us Mutual aggressors

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.520
you know to each other and that's the

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.659
the

01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:18.780
so I was reading something that I really

01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:23.100
wanted to ask you to to think

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:28.320
um with us about if it resonates

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.659
that at some point in in what is

01:11:30.659 --> 01:11:31.920
philosophy

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.380
um the lesson guitar you talk about

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.380
shame

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:44.120
that as a not a personal shame but as a

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.719
as a

01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:50.400
con as a meeting the Intolerable

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.020
and that that can become

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:58.380
a a geophysical Force you know and and

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:00.360
the beginning of a geophysical

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.640
philosophy

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.060
um and you know I

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.199
I I don't really want to say

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:12.480
much more about that but you know in the

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.060
affect realm you know what where do you

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.719
place shame

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:20.400
okay we'll talk about that and then

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.960
we'll do the shift I think that's

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.520
required here

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.900
um so

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.320
I make that now just like a lot of these

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.420
words different people use it in

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.920
different ways so there's shame and

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.480
guilt and some people mean guilt when

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.159
they say shame and some people mean

01:12:35.159 --> 01:12:37.080
shame when they say guilt and blah blah

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.640
blah so

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.840
um where I how I work with it is

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:46.800
guilt is when you know something's wrong

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.920
it's it's going to be

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.960
um you even believe it's wrong yourself

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.520
right

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.400
uh you're gonna do it anyways right so

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.040
kids go in and you steal candy at the

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.780
candy store you know it's wrong that's

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.940
half the fun of it right so you're

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.320
guilty

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.420
um and

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:10.320
um shame is when something energy in you

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.679
arises spontaneously like the kid that

01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:16.800
goes and break something or I tell the

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.380
story when I caught that tomcat and I

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.900
started twirling it around by its tail

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.000
and at the time I didn't and then all of

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.159
a sudden the little switch came off and

01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:29.219
I felt ashamed right because I didn't

01:13:29.219 --> 01:13:31.020
want to hurt it I didn't mean to hurt it

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.940
I was just a little kid and I didn't

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:36.659
have like oh this is bad but then that

01:13:36.659 --> 01:13:38.699
awareness came in and I felt ashamed so

01:13:38.699 --> 01:13:41.520
Shane is wearing something authentic or

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.140
rises in you

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.840
uh like you're masturbating when you're

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.760
a child and someone says don't do that

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.500
and then all of a sudden there was a

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:51.480
before when it was authentic and now

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.800
you're ashamed

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.960
and I find Shane being extremely

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.340
problematic because it pervert it puts

01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.280
the person into a double bind they know

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.219
it was authentic it comes from nature

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:06.360
and yet

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.100
it's not acceptable and and so either I

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:16.500
have to deny uh natural arousal or I

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.420
have to create a false self

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:21.140
now there's so so

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.880
curiosity around these things where do

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.739
you want the energy to go what it is

01:14:25.739 --> 01:14:27.719
more much more

01:14:27.719 --> 01:14:31.080
uh in in interesting to me than Shame

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.540
Shame is going to come up anyways we

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.460
want I don't think we should maximize it

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.260
in the system

01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.520
um

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.820
what I think is important in political

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.580
let's say systems is more people need to

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.440
have single Loop feedback if you do

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.620
something wrong you get

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:52.500
at a small scale you get punished at a

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.060
small scale you know like if we if you

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.820
if you use too much electricity you

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.140
don't get punished because the

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.120
punishment's at the end of some complex

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.100
climate change things so that's that's

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.560
one thing that it can be problematic but

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.020
how do we Define how do we

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:12.960
um design single Loop

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.300
um feedback systems into the society as

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.219
a question has all kinds of problems

01:15:17.219 --> 01:15:18.659
because people aren't Sovereign they

01:15:18.659 --> 01:15:19.980
don't have Choice blah blah blah okay

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.679
but what's more important to me about

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:26.400
this question you asked is they can only

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.199
be and this is a shift we're going to do

01:15:28.199 --> 01:15:29.640
when we come back and without they can

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:33.719
only be solved by a collective

01:15:33.719 --> 01:15:36.980
perspective so

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.300
it's you have to say well here's the

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.719
human system it's one body

01:15:41.719 --> 01:15:44.940
and parts of the body are dying like

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.159
from Fentanyl and parts of the body are

01:15:47.159 --> 01:15:49.920
making Fentanyl and and opioids and

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.080
getting there's something wrong with the

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.179
body that is the human body you see

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:57.480
there's there's it's like part you can

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.140
there's kind of an autoimmune

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:05.880
disease that is the human body and so so

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.460
so there is stratifications you know

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.500
some parts of the body are making

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.120
histamine in some parts of the body

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.560
trying to kill the things that are

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.960
making histamine and blah blah blah blah

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.480
but

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.520
um the the question we have to ask is

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.120
what's wrong with the human body

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.239
what's wrong with the human body what

01:16:27.239 --> 01:16:30.120
does human body need

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.760
um now I would argue more access to

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.380
Nature more different kinds of

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.300
ontological design all these other

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.060
things which is a different argument

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:41.219
than

01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:43.980
trying to change the relationship

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.380
between the parts in the human body you

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.219
know

01:16:47.219 --> 01:16:51.060
um now there there's there's there's a

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:54.179
place and time for like I you know

01:16:54.179 --> 01:16:56.159
frustrates me that

01:16:56.159 --> 01:16:58.679
the pharmaceutical companies have not

01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:02.340
been I'd give them death or life

01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:04.980
sentences for the opioid epidemic and

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.900
they very clearly understood what they

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.159
were doing in the same way that the lead

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:13.679
in lead and gas people knew what they're

01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:16.080
doing that killed 10 10 million people

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.940
or something and made everybody in

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:19.320
America

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.040
um

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:22.800
what would I choose by whatever you know

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.960
all these things that the scientists

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.320
knew that companies knew the So within

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.239
in the system there's a time and place

01:17:30.239 --> 01:17:32.520
for like these repercussions to be

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.140
happening

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:37.320
um but when you're asked the question at

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.659
the larger level

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:41.880
it's this question like what's wrong

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.400
with the

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.060
yeah it's like watching a bunch of

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.659
um it's like watching a a bunch of of

01:17:51.659 --> 01:17:54.300
bats come out too early in the year and

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.040
start to fight and there's no food and

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.679
like for you for years and years and

01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:01.440
years Ten Thousand Years they've had a

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:03.300
rhythm that made sense and you so you

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.340
say what's wrong with the bats not why

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.140
is this bat chopping the head off of

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:09.719
that bat there's something extremely

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:12.500
wrong with the collective Behavior

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.340
and

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:16.080
um and so

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.159
so it's that kind of question

01:18:20.159 --> 01:18:22.860
um or that kind of perspective that is I

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.159
think a more interesting question

01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:27.960
um

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:31.340
but yeah it's it's

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.219
and in the meantime you know you're

01:18:38.219 --> 01:18:41.900
watching the human body

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.719
it's kind of like I you know we're

01:18:45.719 --> 01:18:47.940
relatively Young

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.060
we're a young enough species that it's

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.560
not like

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.380
we've hung on forever

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.860
um it's like watching a young body die

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.960
you don't know what's wrong with it you

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.940
know and you're testing this and it's

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:04.980
not cancer and it's not this and it's

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:08.340
and you know and it's maybe it and it's

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:11.000
not that and everything you do

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.640
every year it's just whittles away and

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.060
whittles away and it's not an old body

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.400
and so what's wrong with it you know

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:22.860
what's what's what's going on is an

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.239
interesting question and it's not linear

01:19:24.239 --> 01:19:26.699
it's not like oh take carbon out of the

01:19:26.699 --> 01:19:28.500
atmosphere and the body will be fine

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.420
it's

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:33.420
so

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.600
and we may just be watching it die I

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.380
mean maybe that's what's happening

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.500
um

01:19:42.659 --> 01:19:46.380
that could be true also

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.780
and then the question is

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:51.300
to what extent I I read once like you

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.699
know the passenger pigeons there was

01:19:53.699 --> 01:19:56.159
such a collective species that there was

01:19:56.159 --> 01:19:58.560
still like hundreds of or thousands of

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.960
them left but in order to survive they

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.300
needed to have the hundreds of thousands

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.480
like colonies so so once the threshold

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.420
went they all disappeared

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.179
um what's the threshold for human you

01:20:12.179 --> 01:20:13.380
know

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.780
you get down to what

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.000
in this in this part of our history you

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.760
get down to like what 500 000 people

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.920
imagine living through that I mean it's

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:29.159
a possibility from Seven not eight nine

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:33.020
million to 500 000 people

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.679
um and then of course you have to make

01:20:37.679 --> 01:20:41.760
the next next move and that is

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.380
um we're part of nature

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.060
and

01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.060
um

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:50.400
it for people to go down to five this is

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.860
a monster's conversation go down to 500

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:56.100
000 people a lot of animals would die

01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.960
because a lot of animals are farm

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.140
animals and pets and nature preserves

01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:02.699
and

01:21:02.699 --> 01:21:05.460
and then say what would be left would

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.060
regenerate itself in a way that we can't

01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:11.840
possibly imagine and so

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.320
so maybe what's wrong with the planetary

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.699
body is this you know humans are out of

01:21:20.699 --> 01:21:23.820
balance and that has to be rebalanced so

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.159
these are all interesting questions when

01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:28.440
you start to

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.840
shift these perspectives and wonder

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.880
whether

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.940
that just results in paralysis or does

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.860
it result in a way to tell a new story

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.900
that starts to heal

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:47.239
the problem I don't know

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.719
but

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:54.840
yeah

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.980
does that make sense

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:03.540
no I it it it it it does especially in

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.400
the context of everything else you're

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.920
doing if that's how you were saying it

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:11.600
would be monstrous as you just said

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.300
I mean

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.280
you're you're actively

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.280
injecting

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:24.300
um uh uh uh the the

01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:30.840
I think the this autoimmune disease you

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.820
know with

01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:33.420
um

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:38.699
what it this body this human body

01:22:38.699 --> 01:22:41.400
um needs and we feel it before we

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.739
understand it in because the

01:22:43.739 --> 01:22:47.600
understanding is is is is is literally

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.940
narrow impaired

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.239
by all kinds of

01:22:53.239 --> 01:22:55.620
justificatory systems I mean this is

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:59.100
where this language really really

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.620
helps to

01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:04.739
not be paralyzed

01:23:04.739 --> 01:23:07.260
okay you can go back to what's the

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.540
justificatory system or you can say oh

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:12.179
okay that's what it is let's keep let's

01:23:12.179 --> 01:23:15.120
keep going okay and that's where I

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.000
really agree with with Claudia and

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.020
Sandra on the on on the importance of

01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:25.320
how this could

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.060
um

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:31.800
and I have no idea how how how the how

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:37.800
but how urgent it is in terms of of the

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:41.760
younger less conditioned members of of

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.840
this human body to not have to be

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.360
suffocated again

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.640
you know

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.120
and that to me is high school I mean I

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:58.980
really feel like this pop-up School

01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:04.140
um could very much meet not match but

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.800
meat a kind of

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:10.920
complexity and aporia which they're

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.020
already know in their bodies and we just

01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:16.260
have to stop lying to them

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:18.719
and say oh no pull yourself up by the

01:24:18.719 --> 01:24:21.239
bootstraps and just you know keep going

01:24:21.239 --> 01:24:24.239
and yeah you know they know implicitly

01:24:24.239 --> 01:24:26.040
and they

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.659
've had and that's your entire knowledge

01:24:27.659 --> 01:24:30.540
knowledge into wrote like large language

01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.080
modules but you know one of the things I

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.420
want to say because came to me it's kind

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:38.340
of like once you switch to the whole

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.480
body

01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.020
like my doc you know he got

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:46.260
he got snatched by a hawk and he's a

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:48.360
tiny little duck but

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.760
a lot it was too heavy for the hawk and

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.580
uh and um he ended up coming back you

01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:58.080
know he's got like a big scrape down his

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.360
back it's not a bad problem but he broke

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.880
one of his legs

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.880
you know so he uses his wings I don't

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.780
know

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.360
thing he's got one eye I bought him

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.580
because his name is Popeye he was born

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.800
without one eye of course that's why the

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.500
hawk got him anyways

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.300
so

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:22.199
um so I bring them I bring them in and I

01:25:22.199 --> 01:25:25.380
put a soft cast on his on his leg on his

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:28.560
foot on his broken leg right now the

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.360
thing is

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.320
there's a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.480
little chance that you can heal a duck's

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.360
leg because it's all cartilage doesn't

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:43.260
work like that usually it falls off

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:46.739
and there's nothing I can do

01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:49.320
there's nothing I can do except feed

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.540
okay so the second day so he's doing

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.820
well the first day because he felt safe

01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:57.000
the second day he starts to

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.400
like he wants to die he wants to die

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.540
because he wants to be in his other

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:03.780
Ducks friends so I take them down to the

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.940
barn where he looks like completely

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.080
pathetic

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.120
the other duck his friends won't go out

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.560
right now because they're too freaked

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.060
out about the hawk so they're right

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.380
there in the barn

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.540
so I put him down there and then they

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.040
notice them they come over and they

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.020
start pecking him to death because

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:22.920
that's what Ducks do okay and so

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.380
now it's fine now they understand it's

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.739
him and he is separated from them in the

01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:30.480
duck house because I don't want them to

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.980
pack him to death they pack him to death

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:33.239
because he doesn't act like a normal

01:26:33.239 --> 01:26:35.280
duck and they're like it freaks him out

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.340
right but now I notice they're all over

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:40.739
there sleeping next to where he is so

01:26:40.739 --> 01:26:43.800
he's becoming a part of the thing and my

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.179
point here is

01:26:45.179 --> 01:26:46.980
that

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:50.699
I have zero control I can try to nudge

01:26:50.699 --> 01:26:52.860
this and try to nudge that

01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:54.480
but

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:57.480
um whether he heals is one thing I mean

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:00.300
I've had Ducks I had this one duck she

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.000
was born with her four five other uh

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.520
friends uh brothers and sisters and she

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.139
was born late like she came out two days

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:09.000
later than the others

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.679
and the mother didn't like the mother

01:27:10.679 --> 01:27:12.060
rejected her

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.980
and then eventually the mother forgot

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.800
because the timing was off right it was

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.679
like what is this you know she was done

01:27:19.679 --> 01:27:21.659
with thinking of her babies as babies

01:27:21.659 --> 01:27:25.199
and and the hormones change but anyways

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:28.020
she eventually hung out with other

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:30.540
brothers and sisters but they picked on

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.780
her and then I tried to isolate her the

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:35.460
more you isolated her the more they

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.020
thought her as other and the more they

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.420
picked on her and then one day she

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.280
wouldn't come in she got so she she

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.540
wouldn't come into the duck house

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:44.100
because she was like

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:47.880
stuck in there with bullies and she

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.440
stayed out and of course something got

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.780
her and so my point is is that when you

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:55.020
think of the body the human body as

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:57.719
nature there are things we have no

01:27:57.719 --> 01:28:00.239
control over it's not because we are

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:03.120
doing this and it's causing that

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:07.380
and you still try to do like this is

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:08.580
what I'm going to talk about the moral

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:11.940
animal like what comes up

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:19.500
in your system despite the fact that you

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.139
know you don't have a direct cause and

01:28:22.139 --> 01:28:23.880
effect in any of this

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.239
and it can be very humbling to to

01:28:27.239 --> 01:28:30.300
realize that the simplest level

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.340
I'm not gonna you know the only thing I

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.739
can do I can't isolate him forever

01:28:34.739 --> 01:28:36.719
because he doesn't want to live I can't

01:28:36.719 --> 01:28:38.520
put him with a bunch of bullies because

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.440
they'll kill him I can't let them go

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.940
outside because he's the first one the

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.280
hawk will get and this is

01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.820
the systemic this is called entanglement

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.560
everybody likes to say everything's

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.780
entangled and you think this is like a

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:55.320
beautiful thing no entangled means

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.920
something else it means it's very rich

01:28:58.920 --> 01:28:59.840
and

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.880
saturated and painful and beautiful at

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.560
the same time and so this is what we're

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.060
going to talk about in the fall like

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.420
this perspective is the collective

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.000
perspective and and and uh

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.880
and the complexity is overwhelming it's

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.900
it's

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:21.500
so then how do you become a moral animal

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.300
understanding yourself as a member of

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.380
this

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.199
this I hate these word system but you

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:30.000
know what I mean and this is like what

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.980
the new theory of the body is it's from

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.320
this perspective which it eventually

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.659
becomes a more mystical perspective and

01:29:36.659 --> 01:29:38.400
you don't really

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.860
less practical maybe but it shifts

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.300
perception

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.219
and

01:29:44.219 --> 01:29:47.639
um and uh

01:29:47.639 --> 01:29:49.820
um

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:55.880
yeah something like that Holly

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.960
yeah I mean I remember hearing Charles

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.639
eisenstein say you know our our goal

01:30:02.639 --> 01:30:04.500
shouldn't be to survive like survival

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.540
shouldn't really be our goal per se it's

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.520
a species

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.080
um and something I I've been really

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:12.840
holding close is is this word devotion

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.159
and

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:16.020
being devoted

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:17.940
um

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.159
being a devoted human being to the world

01:30:20.159 --> 01:30:21.420
around me

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.080
um

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.580
and that includes just like giving

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:27.480
praise for for what's around me

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:29.580
um and I keep coming back Bonnie to that

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:30.960
story you told at the workshop about

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:33.659
trust and The Ledger and like how much

01:30:33.659 --> 01:30:35.219
you hated The Ledger you noticed

01:30:35.219 --> 01:30:37.440
The Ledger was alive and it was like I

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.780
hate this thing

01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.120
um which kind of gave this motivation to

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:44.460
really work with it and um I'm just

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:47.580
noticing again like How Deeply the

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:48.960
malware runs

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.679
um as I'm like really devoting myself

01:30:52.679 --> 01:30:54.000
um

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.280
it's Relentless it's like and and I just

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:57.900
keep having to come back to this like

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.000
Mantra of like do not feed the malware

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.980
do not feed the monsters don't feed them

01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.840
they they feed on your attention and

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.600
they Feast on your fear

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:10.020
but it's it's really hard and

01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.040
um

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.840
and I you know it's like I don't know

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.460
any other way though I don't you know

01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.500
other than to just keep coming back to

01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.000
this

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.440
um

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.719
thou to being devoted to the world

01:31:21.719 --> 01:31:24.239
around me because that's there's like no

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:25.679
other way there's no that's like what

01:31:25.679 --> 01:31:27.239
I'm called to do

01:31:27.239 --> 01:31:28.199
um

01:31:28.199 --> 01:31:30.600
and trusting that I have the capacity to

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.159
hold that like trusting that I have the

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:34.260
capacity to

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.179
work through whatever whatever malware

01:31:36.179 --> 01:31:39.679
needs to be worked through

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.739
that that ledger

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:54.600
conversation and

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.560
how it ties to justification

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.080
has been really

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:05.600
a very much in my body

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:09.239
noticing the

01:32:09.239 --> 01:32:10.679
uh

01:32:10.679 --> 01:32:16.440
the subtle and not so subtle tracking of

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:21.199
this and that and the

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:25.860
the calibration that is part of the

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:30.540
malware is profound it just

01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:33.120
and I hate the Ledger and it's

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.780
still here

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.239
's eisenstein thoughts about the gift

01:32:42.239 --> 01:32:43.980
economy this is what he's talking about

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:47.580
like the very it's interesting because

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:50.820
we all agree but then when you expose

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:53.820
the malware in yourself at this micro

01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:56.219
level

01:32:56.219 --> 01:32:57.960
um

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:00.659
um but but the but the good news is is

01:33:00.659 --> 01:33:02.520
that's where you actually have leverage

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.860
to change like you can't go out and

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.080
create you know and so it's yes Holly

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:09.480
it's hard to get rid of but you only

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.639
have one enemy and it's right there and

01:33:11.639 --> 01:33:14.580
you just keep like you know blasting it

01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:17.639
with like some kind of turbocharged

01:33:17.639 --> 01:33:22.199
laser stand you use your mental stare

01:33:22.199 --> 01:33:25.560
it's like the you know like as lasers to

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.980
burn it out like and and and

01:33:28.980 --> 01:33:31.320
um uh

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:33.780
and then you have maximum then so that's

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.120
the good news about it that that it's

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:38.219
not so complex it's a little bit

01:33:38.219 --> 01:33:40.739
complicated and it

01:33:40.739 --> 01:33:42.960
gets subtler and subtler and more clever

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:45.960
uh that's kind of funny but it's right

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:47.219
there it's right there where you can

01:33:47.219 --> 01:33:48.780
work with it

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.880
um especially once it gets loud because

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:53.159
it gets it's it's so loud that even even

01:33:53.159 --> 01:33:55.560
as it gets subtler it seems very loud

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.560
like like your mother tries to tell you

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.960
to clean up your room and she notices

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:03.000
you get mad and then she goes can you

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.040
please clean up your room and you're so

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.460
triggered like this is this is using

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.460
that kind of trigger mechanism

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:16.920
um to to to get that get that out and

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:18.840
um uh

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.219
yeah

01:34:20.219 --> 01:34:22.199
that was a good question I think I think

01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:25.199
Sophia asked that but

01:34:25.199 --> 01:34:26.639
um that's a big one it's a big one

01:34:26.639 --> 01:34:29.300
because we live in you know capitalist

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.600
society and I don't know I don't know

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.400
how far back it goes

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.900
um which is different than a sense of

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.239
fairness but

01:34:39.239 --> 01:34:40.320
um

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.020
yeah it's nice to see that reflected

01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.480
back because this is how the I am with

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.440
all this malware like like just

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.620
um

01:34:52.199 --> 01:34:54.739
yeah

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.300
it also gives you compassion for the way

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:02.340
the world works because

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:06.540
um to even have the experience someone

01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:08.760
pointing it out to you so you can see it

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.580
so you can work on it is is not

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.800
something that many people have the

01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:17.360
opportunity to experience

01:35:21.719 --> 01:35:23.760
so for those of you listening or haven't

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:25.880
heard The Ledger is like

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.040
when you find yourself I was talking

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.900
about in a relationship with your

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:34.380
partner you find yourself having like a

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:36.239
little Ledger I'm doing a little more

01:35:36.239 --> 01:35:39.600
he's owes me a little less and and then

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.520
you notice you're doing this at work and

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:43.320
you're doing this with society and

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:47.000
you're always calculating like

01:35:47.639 --> 01:35:49.980
it making sure you get as much as you

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:53.520
give and and it's and

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.800
um so it's one thing to have that

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.080
relationship with the bank uh it's

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:00.360
another thing to notice that there's a

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.639
little Ledger in your head that is

01:36:02.639 --> 01:36:04.620
calculating

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:07.679
um experience like this all the time

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:08.400
um

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.500
and of course

01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:14.100
um rarely is does The Ledger tell you

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.380
that you owe everybody else a lot more

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:18.239
this is a double whammy The Ledger

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:20.699
itself is horrible but it's usually

01:36:20.699 --> 01:36:25.620
rather biased in what it calculates uh

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:26.940
um especially because you can't have

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.460
first person experience of what effort

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:32.820
somebody else has put into you so

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:36.600
um yeah it's a it's a cruel cruel uh

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.139
master

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.199
let's face it there's a lot of slackers

01:36:43.199 --> 01:36:45.679
out there

01:36:53.639 --> 01:36:55.679
yeah it just feels like this work is not

01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:57.000
for the faint of heart it really does

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.739
take a lot of courage and then it takes

01:36:58.739 --> 01:37:00.300
it takes a community it takes other

01:37:00.300 --> 01:37:03.139
people you know

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.219
yeah especially because you sometimes we

01:37:11.219 --> 01:37:13.500
have a ledger around our work like

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.020
little Sudley down the road I think I'm

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.820
gonna write the book and make a lot of

01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:20.040
money you know like

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.900
like it's just

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:25.639
it's just dizzying

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.540
yeah and we also have the world to help

01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:31.440
us

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.560
there's always Beautiful Moments you

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.679
know

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.920
so do peacocks have a ledger

01:37:43.139 --> 01:37:45.960
well that's interesting I don't think so

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.840
I think peacocks are just

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.440
they're just

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.800
peacocking I mean

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.800
I think they really like to show off I

01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:02.940
don't think it's like like uh I don't

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.380
even think it's that I think that's the

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.960
I think that's the consequence but I

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.600
think they just like to show show off

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.340
you know

01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.400
um

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.980
especially like well never mind

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:31.739
which is why well I suppose I just say

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:34.860
which is why you need peacock energy to

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:38.040
to write a book because you have to have

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.380
energy whether it's gonna make you're

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.060
gonna get laid or not you know that's to

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.340
me what peacock energy is It's gotta you

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:45.840
just gotta

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.420
yeah go ahead John

01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.400
I'm just saying that's supposed to be a

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.800
peacock but I raised by my mother so I'm

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.340
kind of a combination and uh definitely

01:38:56.340 --> 01:39:02.639
that's not my goal uh but uh I have uh

01:39:02.639 --> 01:39:05.520
I do have that non-receptable care and a

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.679
person that I'm living with but I I do

01:39:07.679 --> 01:39:11.219
have a ledger because she she's supposed

01:39:11.219 --> 01:39:15.000
to do 300 worth of work a month and it

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.300
should be 500. uh but she has just her

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.580
own thing and I can't enforce her so

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:23.400
it's non-recipical and so I have my

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:26.159
ledger so because I keep trying to work

01:39:26.159 --> 01:39:28.760
with it

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.260
but she's valuable for the company for

01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:34.580
my centers so you know it's an exchange

01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:39.239
so so I just have to balance that out so

01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:41.040
thanks to the conversation

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.739
yeah so a ledger is good for an economy

01:39:43.739 --> 01:39:45.780
if you're in an economic relationship

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.000
and this is a very good constraint you

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.880
never want your kids never to understand

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.739
their value and exchange value and stuff

01:39:52.739 --> 01:39:54.960
like that it's whether you're running a

01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.900
ledger in these other domains

01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.820
um where you probably shouldn't be

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.679
running a ledger like between you and

01:40:01.679 --> 01:40:03.600
your husband or you and your kids or you

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:08.820
and some kind of moral devotion uh and

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:11.280
that's not really what's happening so so

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.340
it's we talk about The Ledger in in yeah

01:40:14.340 --> 01:40:18.060
those domains of care so you so it's not

01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:21.960
that The Ledger is uh inappropriate and

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.260
in times it's much better it can solve

01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.199
very complicated complex relational

01:40:28.199 --> 01:40:30.540
problems but

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.400
it's this other thing that's always

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.360
counting and never in the and it counts

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.040
in a way that it's never enough the

01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:39.600
return is Never Enough the always

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.840
charging more interest on your labor

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.440
than uh yeah so

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.600
um and and when it's in the wrong domain

01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.340
it's completely

01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:51.679
um

01:40:51.679 --> 01:40:56.060
destructive of those relationships

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.199
and body it also wants to speak

01:41:10.199 --> 01:41:14.540
sometimes doesn't it but

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.920
yeah so so

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.960
it depends on what level you're working

01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.120
with it you know sometimes it's just

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.179
there and in between a relationship you

01:41:27.179 --> 01:41:29.520
just have to say I just feel like I give

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.620
give give give and you don't give

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:34.020
anything back because it's important

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.179
that someone knows that you feel that

01:41:36.179 --> 01:41:39.360
way and and you don't say in a way that

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.420
I give give give and you just don't give

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:43.739
back that's not what you're saying

01:41:43.739 --> 01:41:46.980
you're saying my you know I just I just

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:49.380
always feel this way then you can look

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.060
at it why do people feel that way and

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.560
there's all kinds of sometimes simple

01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.179
reasons

01:41:54.179 --> 01:41:56.699
um that's gotten very complex

01:41:56.699 --> 01:41:58.739
um so yes

01:41:58.739 --> 01:42:00.600
um but then there's another level at

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.719
which which is uh more of a

01:42:03.719 --> 01:42:05.780
uh kind of

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.280
you know

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.920
um wisdom practice level or something

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.380
where you you just

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.560
you just wanna

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:17.940
experiment with not having that at all

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.340
and that's a kind of a more radical

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:21.780
thing

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.800
um

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:26.219
if you're if it helps then if you don't

01:42:26.219 --> 01:42:27.780
have like a real business but when

01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:29.100
you're in a business environment that's

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.619
transactional too these are interesting

01:42:31.619 --> 01:42:34.080
questions you know like

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.699
um and it's so you have to move between

01:42:35.699 --> 01:42:38.340
these different domains

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:39.360
um

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.280
but yeah

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.280
um

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:47.580
sometimes it's energy it's built up as a

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:50.460
ledger because it's it's energy that

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:51.659
should have been released as

01:42:51.659 --> 01:42:55.340
conversation so

01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:58.619
yeah that's that's an energy with it

01:42:58.619 --> 01:43:02.340
that sometimes wants to speak and you

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.260
kind of know that

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.060
um

01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.800
if you're going to speak with that kind

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:11.219
of energy you have to slow way down

01:43:11.219 --> 01:43:14.119
moves too fast

01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:48.360
and I'm just going to say one more thing

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.520
because you feel something like that and

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.800
then I always want to put sometimes

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:55.139
after it because

01:43:55.139 --> 01:43:56.880
you kind of don't want to make a big

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.880
declaration for all time

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.860
you know because

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:05.360
the feeling changes

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.080
yeah I appreciate that Claudia I noticed

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:18.000
that when I'm like using the words

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.840
always never or should like I there's

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.820
something there's the red flags you know

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:26.219
like what am I doing and that's great it

01:44:26.219 --> 01:44:28.260
causes me to slow down and investigate

01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:30.800
further

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:32.280
yeah I'm usually foreclosing on

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.520
something

01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:45.360
we could we could and if you want to

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.400
just close this conversation Around The

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.440
Ledger what what we didn't do in that

01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:51.960
workshop and

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.840
um so we did the trust

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.780
the trust Workshop always comes with

01:44:57.780 --> 01:45:00.900
trust power and action thresholds

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:03.179
um so hopefully maybe we can do it in

01:45:03.179 --> 01:45:05.940
that same venue the other two but

01:45:05.940 --> 01:45:09.719
um The Ledger and and this I think is

01:45:09.719 --> 01:45:13.560
maybe helpful so The Ledger is an

01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.980
economy an economy

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:17.820
um

01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:20.159
has to do with

01:45:20.159 --> 01:45:23.940
um action action threshold so

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:25.800
so

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:28.040
um all economic

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:31.260
instruments are created to lower action

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:34.860
thresholds right so it's easier for me

01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:37.340
to barter a sheepskin

01:45:37.340 --> 01:45:41.540
for a pound of rice if I have a coin

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:44.699
that can evaluate it so now it's much

01:45:44.699 --> 01:45:46.920
easier we have to sit and bargain and

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.760
okay and so it's easier much easier to

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.780
create a credit card now everything in

01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:58.139
the system can move faster so every if

01:45:58.139 --> 01:46:01.440
you want to define a economy it has an

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.420
instrument like a ledger which is a

01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:06.239
system of valuation that lowers action

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:07.980
thresholds if it doesn't lower action

01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.619
thresholds it's not an economy it works

01:46:10.619 --> 01:46:12.360
in the opposite way

01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.760
and so what you're talking about Claudia

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.580
is The Ledger that builds up and builds

01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.739
up until it lowers the action threshold

01:46:19.739 --> 01:46:22.320
you have to say it

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.440
um and and and

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:28.260
this is also the ancient ledgers where

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.980
you know you keep accounting of how much

01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:35.100
someone in the community has has O's and

01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:39.179
O's and O's until you have to break that

01:46:39.179 --> 01:46:42.600
cycle or something like that so

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.580
um economies always lower action

01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.560
thresholds of course the problem with

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:49.139
the modern system is we have too many

01:46:49.139 --> 01:46:51.420
economic action protocols so everything

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:55.679
we do is to speed up us and we have the

01:46:55.679 --> 01:46:57.900
other two things which is trust and

01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.280
power

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.860
um that should uh cycle with uh

01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:08.699
there are there are breaks on

01:47:08.699 --> 01:47:11.219
no system should just blow action

01:47:11.219 --> 01:47:13.679
thresholds there's needs to be systems

01:47:13.679 --> 01:47:15.420
in a healthy system

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.540
that also raises the thresholds for

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:20.520
Action right

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.580
um so trust is something trust and trust

01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.780
is something that will raise uh the

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.880
threshold for Action so if someone's

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.000
going out on a binge uh you don't trust

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.159
them with that you you take the you know

01:47:35.159 --> 01:47:36.780
you take the keys away from your kid

01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:38.699
that you don't trust because the keys

01:47:38.699 --> 01:47:40.619
are making

01:47:40.619 --> 01:47:42.900
action there's too much action on the

01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:45.679
other side so trust ideally

01:47:45.679 --> 01:47:49.739
counter valences uh

01:47:49.739 --> 01:47:52.440
the economy so trust is the purview of

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.840
the of the governance the problem our

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.820
government is only an economic system

01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:00.360
now you see this is It's supposed to be

01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:03.179
like uh complex systems have complex

01:48:03.179 --> 01:48:06.060
feedback loops sometimes it adds and

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.219
sometimes it takes away and then the

01:48:08.219 --> 01:48:11.219
third one is the power situation all

01:48:11.219 --> 01:48:16.800
all complex systems go through cycles of

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:20.340
power cycles and

01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:22.560
um and

01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.679
um trust and and

01:48:24.679 --> 01:48:27.360
governance the trust system which is the

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:28.980
governance and the action threshold

01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.480
system which is the economy by

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.119
themselves will not Balance power so you

01:48:33.119 --> 01:48:37.320
need a third system a welfare system or

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.080
education and all these other systems

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:42.260
that are in a healthy uh

01:48:42.260 --> 01:48:43.920
Society

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.280
is the third the third Dynamic and

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:49.800
sometimes that system skews power one

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.920
way or the other and again we don't we

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.199
we have those and we have a governance

01:48:55.199 --> 01:48:57.500
in our society but almost all of them

01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:02.659
are set up like action threshold

01:49:02.659 --> 01:49:05.159
they're all take on the action protocol

01:49:05.159 --> 01:49:07.380
of the economic system

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.739
and they're not they're not balanced so

01:49:10.739 --> 01:49:16.500
um yeah so that's part of the larger uh

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.619
the larger we just did that little piece

01:49:19.619 --> 01:49:22.920
on trust we didn't really do

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.920
the larger

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:28.199
macro system that is a society but

01:49:28.199 --> 01:49:32.300
that's an interesting conversation too

01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:41.520
you see one of the things about power is

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:44.760
how do you how do you balance power in a

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.320
system

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.260
um well right now our system balances

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.000
Power by

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.179
see so power is my resources

01:49:56.219 --> 01:49:59.159
and skills by skills and resources

01:49:59.159 --> 01:50:02.639
divided by my needs and wants that's my

01:50:02.639 --> 01:50:04.560
power equation

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.980
so I meet up with a bear I have certain

01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.560
skills and resources and the bear has

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.659
certain skills and resources and I have

01:50:12.659 --> 01:50:14.040
certain needs and wants and that bear

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.960
has certain needs and wants and whoever

01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.960
whatever happens in the interaction

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:22.639
will be determined by the that that

01:50:22.639 --> 01:50:26.159
equation right so

01:50:26.159 --> 01:50:28.800
um if the barrel has a lot of want for

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:30.119
my food

01:50:30.119 --> 01:50:32.280
that puts them in a certain power

01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:35.820
equation that if I have a gun uh then I

01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:38.520
put but if I have a if I don't have any

01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:41.820
karaoke eats my food or not so you see

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.940
and the problem with our culture

01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:47.600
is that it only uh talks about

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:50.699
increasing your skills and resources

01:50:50.699 --> 01:50:53.420
because it works with the economy

01:50:53.420 --> 01:50:56.340
everything is skewed and it doesn't talk

01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:58.679
about lowering the needs and wants

01:50:58.679 --> 01:51:00.960
and the best way if you want in this

01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.980
culture

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:04.139
to get gain power

01:51:04.139 --> 01:51:07.020
is to lower your needs and wants and not

01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.520
spend all your time trying to increase

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.900
your skills or resources

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:17.100
and this is the and you can see why the

01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.780
the the top of the equation is

01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:22.080
emphasized because it feeds into

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:24.780
increasing more action so everything the

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.179
other two sides of the system are all

01:51:27.179 --> 01:51:29.820
skewed toward the third side of the

01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:32.060
system

01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.260
so and now we go off in that tangent

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:42.119
that's a whole nother

01:51:42.119 --> 01:51:45.000
well it seems to be related to what uh

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.420
you read in your book in a way

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:51.360
and me promoting my Center

01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.460
I'm trying to get deeper into my

01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:56.280
meditation teaching and I'm going out to

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:59.040
do that and it's trying to acquire more

01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.600
but then so

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.239
I can have more power but now you're

01:52:03.239 --> 01:52:06.239
saying I I'd have more power but not

01:52:06.239 --> 01:52:07.920
doing all of that and just being happy

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:10.920
in my little corner balanced out in all

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.840
my resources

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.480
but at the same time you want to go out

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:18.260
there I want to go out there

01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:20.699
there's a constant check like the first

01:52:20.699 --> 01:52:25.320
time I gave that that Workshop was in um

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:27.420
just outside of Berlin at a retreat

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:30.780
center and you know it's the same thing

01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:32.400
like in the trust you do this little

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:33.480
thing

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.520
if someone looked up and said

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.219
that's why my wife has more power than

01:52:38.219 --> 01:52:39.480
me

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.940
it was so obvious

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:43.860
because she didn't really give a

01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:46.980
about and he was always constantly

01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.960
needing her attention

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:52.739
and it was so obvious to him that that

01:52:52.739 --> 01:52:54.960
that that that was the part of the

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:57.360
equation he had to work on

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.739
that he wasn't sovereign

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:04.260
but it looked like it's the same like

01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.840
when you're a teenager this is this this

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.940
one thing could be taught this is a good

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.320
thing for high school you want to talk

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.659
about High School curriculum if you're a

01:53:12.659 --> 01:53:14.280
teenager I can honestly speak as a

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.560
teenage girl and you walk in you know

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.900
like a little party and this guy comes

01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.760
over to you and

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:23.760
your your whole body shits right you

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.940
because you can't talk okay this person

01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.520
has power over you

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:33.060
because power is who gets to move who

01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:35.820
who gets to move who that could be

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:37.920
interpreted as that person is being

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.320
aggressive just by the fact that your

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.600
hormones are moving because that is what

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:44.580
power is who gets to move who he's

01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:49.800
moving my whole body right he's like so

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:54.000
the problem is you identify them as an

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.760
aggressor versus like you don't have

01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:00.780
sovereignty over your own your own body

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:02.639
um so

01:54:02.639 --> 01:54:03.659
um

01:54:03.659 --> 01:54:04.619
um

01:54:04.619 --> 01:54:08.159
yeah understanding this this the complex

01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:09.900
uh

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:12.360
system with complex field Loops it is

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:15.420
the human system at this level the

01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.060
institutional level is very is very

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.860
interesting

01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:21.920
um

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.060
yeah

01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:27.360
yeah but I don't know I mean there I

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.699
think I sense a little bit of

01:54:29.699 --> 01:54:30.300
um

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:34.860
you know I want to hold the Paradox you

01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:37.139
know of one of the sessions where you

01:54:37.139 --> 01:54:39.600
ended still rings in my ears saying

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:42.900
people just don't care people just don't

01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:46.619
care I mean so I mean where where does

01:54:46.619 --> 01:54:48.659
the body the human body

01:54:48.659 --> 01:54:52.619
and our sovereignty in this whole idea

01:54:52.619 --> 01:54:56.159
that you are to master that you know

01:54:56.159 --> 01:54:58.199
hormonal whatever

01:54:58.199 --> 01:55:01.219
as opposed to

01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:04.619
um perhaps being able to

01:55:04.619 --> 01:55:07.560
you know make a joke about it like you

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.900
just walked up to me and look at me I'm

01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:13.920
just red all over and and where you make

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.500
fun of yourself and in that way

01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:18.360
you know kind of

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.260
um um slide off the spell of this

01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:25.139
supposed power to move you

01:55:25.139 --> 01:55:27.239
I don't know if this is making any sense

01:55:27.239 --> 01:55:28.739
I think I was saying people don't care

01:55:28.739 --> 01:55:30.179
because they don't care about the

01:55:30.179 --> 01:55:31.679
environment they don't really care about

01:55:31.679 --> 01:55:33.300
nature they don't really care about

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:35.699
other people they're just overwhelmed

01:55:35.699 --> 01:55:38.699
with themselves basically

01:55:38.699 --> 01:55:40.920
um they you know that's why they have we

01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.900
have ledgers and all this stuff and so

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:45.780
that's what I was saying we we don't

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:47.460
take care of things because we don't

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.280
care about those things and we

01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.040
you know it's all very

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:54.840
everything we evaluate everything

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:58.920
according to our own our own self

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.600
um including

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.840
um yeah so uh that's the shift from

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:06.420
egocentric to allocentric

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:07.700
um so

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:08.159
[Music]

01:56:08.159 --> 01:56:09.719
um

01:56:09.719 --> 01:56:11.820
um but

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:12.860
um

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:14.719
what is

01:56:14.719 --> 01:56:16.980
what is

01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.300
um the move here is to understand

01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:23.820
why is it that this is happening to me

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:28.440
and that it's that it's not uh what I

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:29.780
you know

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:32.460
what I I mean a lot of people know this

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.679
they're aware of this but

01:56:34.679 --> 01:56:37.940
and understanding that the

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:40.980
situation is is unstable because your

01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:44.820
body is unstable and perhaps uh

01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:47.040
understanding that the if you want to

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:51.060
fix that then the direct method is to

01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:55.139
have control of your dispositional state

01:56:55.139 --> 01:56:58.560
um and but we noticed that and then you

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:02.219
might notice that despite this feeling I

01:57:02.219 --> 01:57:05.159
keep approaching uh that situation I

01:57:05.159 --> 01:57:06.960
don't avoid it and that's an interesting

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.639
question

01:57:08.639 --> 01:57:11.040
um and then

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:14.340
um understanding that the situation is

01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:17.639
more complex than than what maybe the

01:57:17.639 --> 01:57:21.300
societal script will have me no

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.139
um maybe bodies sometimes are like uh

01:57:25.139 --> 01:57:27.840
are Like Moths To Flames here's another

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:30.599
monstrous conversations maybe my body is

01:57:30.599 --> 01:57:33.420
like a moth to Flame and it's not just

01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:36.119
that the other person's an

01:57:36.119 --> 01:57:38.760
um so like I had what I call bad boy

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.920
syndrome for a long time I mean I just

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:44.280
was very attracted to men who I would

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.320
call bad boy syndromes you know like

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:49.260
they're not people you want to devote

01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.360
yourself to but

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.300
there was a reality there I'm off to a

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:56.460
flame moth to a flame moth to a flame

01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:58.679
moth to a flame what's that what's going

01:57:58.679 --> 01:57:59.760
on there

01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:03.360
that's an interesting phenomenon uh it's

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.340
I'm not saying we should be like that or

01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:08.400
we have but it is something that some

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:10.739
people go phases they are they go

01:58:10.739 --> 01:58:13.860
through what is that what is that's a

01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:16.980
very interesting thing and

01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:19.679
um it's in this comes back to shame I

01:58:19.679 --> 01:58:21.659
don't want to be ashamed that I was like

01:58:21.659 --> 01:58:23.340
a moth to a flame

01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:27.000
uh because it was authentic and I knew

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.500
it and yet yeah yeah I'm off to a flame

01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.980
um so that's what I mean that it's the

01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:38.760
complexity of what is actually uh

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:41.400
in the system that I'm not that that I'm

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.139
excluding

01:58:43.139 --> 01:58:44.280
um

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.340
um

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.780
and and the social scripts will only

01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.179
exclude you know I think this script or

01:58:51.179 --> 01:58:52.619
this script or this script they're too

01:58:52.619 --> 01:58:54.719
tidy they exclude what is actually a

01:58:54.719 --> 01:58:56.159
case

01:58:56.159 --> 01:58:59.580
um yeah so something like that

01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:00.480
um

01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.119
so this has been good because it shows

01:59:03.119 --> 01:59:05.580
that we did something very systematic

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:09.900
and module like but all these real

01:59:09.900 --> 01:59:14.300
questions should be able to be

01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:18.540
seen in a new light from some of the uh

01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:21.239
background that that we've been working

01:59:21.239 --> 01:59:23.159
with and

01:59:23.159 --> 01:59:25.020
um and

01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:28.020
um yeah moving on to

01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:28.860
um

01:59:28.860 --> 01:59:29.960
yeah

01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:33.780
this is an interesting thing so

01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:37.320
um okay so with that I would like to say

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:39.780
thank you for being here I enjoyed the

01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:42.000
company and the conversation very much

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.159
and we'll have one more read it cap

01:59:44.159 --> 01:59:45.599
maybe we could look at more of what

01:59:45.599 --> 01:59:47.639
we're going to do uh when we come back

01:59:47.639 --> 01:59:50.119
in the fall



## Cohort 6

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.860
foreign

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.600
music as a psychotechnology

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.699
okay this is the final final

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.100
recap session which is the final module

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
of the 2023

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670
uh background series

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.500
[Music]

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.360
um and I'm just going to leave it there

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.379
and ask you all to uh reflect

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.920
or a genufact uh

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.940
I mean reflect uh get that Catholic

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.579
thing out of here

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.039
um on uh yeah this year so far and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.600
um

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.559
what you hope like it'd be great to know

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.040
what you hope will be included

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.159
um

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.380
in the fall sessions and if there's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.340
outstanding like

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.860
holes or questions or needs or something

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.920
like that like something that's absent

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.500
um that we might uh take special pains

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.460
um

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
or special Joy uh to weave into

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.159
um the content as we go forward so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.140
that's just a prompt it doesn't have to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
be that but it's something that um I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.439
hadn't prompted before so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.399
um yeah what do you think and you know

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.759
okay that's all I'm gonna say

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.899
and I'll leave it at that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.360
all right Bonnie I'll genuflect

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.280
I don't know how

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.220
is it this thing I'm not sure

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.720
oh okay

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.980
I have a question I'm a little confused

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.540
in the justification module

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.640
um

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.220
I'll read you a sentence that's kind of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.440
like where I'm stuck

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.260
in our theory of the body we can Chase

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.900
trace the origins

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.300
and root ground of the justification

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.319
system in the virtual perceptions and

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.540
the virtual Perceptions in the animal

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
bodies sensory motor processes

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.019
so

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.840
and maybe I'm getting like confused

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.239
between

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.519
simulation

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.519
justification virtual

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.019
um perception

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.280
when I look at the how I justify things

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.780
or my own justification system

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.819
it

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.200
seems very rooted in my egocentric

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.420
psyche schema

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.900
landscape

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.319
so I'm just

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.260
wondering how that

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.700
relates to the animal bodies

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.840
sensory motor

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.540
processes

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.580
if that makes sense

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.319
yeah it makes sense it's a poorly

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.200
constructed sentence uh

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.080
because it it okay it's a poorly

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.200
constructed sentence and and it's

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.940
simpler than you're trying to make it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.159
okay so

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.319
um but all the parts are there the way

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.519
you described it so there's two types of

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.220
um ways we use the word justification

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.919
and one is like when I'm trying to

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.160
justify or rationalize my behavior

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.800
and certainly that's a subset of

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.340
justification but

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.979
um a lot we're trying to use the

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.440
justification system

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.620
as Greg Enriquez uses it and that is

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.520
like

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.560
well Obama's

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.720
thing is kind of like trying to

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.320
rationalize it but if you if you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.500
had a child in your car that was dying

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.919
or really injured and you and you were

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.560
going faster than the speed limit and a

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.900
cop pulled you over you would use a

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.520
shared justification system

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.699
the per the cop would understand how you

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.940
were justifying something right

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.580
um so marriage is a shared justification

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.940
system it has certain economic contracts

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.040
and certain protections under this state

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.800
and all these things so they're not

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.979
necessarily bad okay they're not

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.020
necessarily serving the ego and in fact

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.419
the term as Greg uses it is much more

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.940
like it's much broader more broadly

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.360
Collective because

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.240
you're trying to

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.180
like if you're saying I'm speeding

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.919
because like

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.039
who talks to me told me to speak that is

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.979
not necessarily a justification system

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.440
right because it's it's not collectively

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.900
held so now the fact that we can have

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.600
shared justification systems is that we

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.120
have shared simulations of reality right

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.699
so when you tell the cop I'm speeding

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.180
because my child is there's a whole

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.479
bunch of things

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.000
that simultaneously line up in your mind

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.080
in the in the cop's mind and their

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.419
mental constructs really right

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.960
and you can understand them

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.780
and so they don't seem like simulations

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.660
when they're that uh strongly shared but

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.400
if you have different justification

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.900
systems

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.440
then the other person seems like just a

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.720
construct and yours seems more real so

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.539
that's what a justification system is

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.240
and

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.360
um

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.720
um

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.840
and the fact that we can have them come

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.039
to the fact that we can share

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.960
simulations you know it's interesting

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.880
questions what whether animals share

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.979
simulations or not

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.680
uh that's that's that we didn't really

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.240
talk about that but that's does that

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.360
does that help like it doesn't really it

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.860
doesn't only mean when I'm trying to

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.960
justify myself because I'm trying to

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.600
rationalize my behavior it's appealing

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.639
to the correct justification system

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.979
because it's a shared construct or

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.740
shared simulation or shared social

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.520
imaginary you might say imaginary is we

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.639
just use that term simulation

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.180
um

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.099
and

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:39.300
yeah so is is there any other is there a

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.039
follow-up to that or does that make

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:44.220
sense well that definitely helps I mean

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:49.259
I think I've been watching

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.919
it's not justification systems I've been

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.979
watching narratives

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:58.400
that are

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.979
anti-helpful and narratives of

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:04.560
Separation that are just sort of

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.080
Habitual

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.280
um

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.020
and I think it goes back to something

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.300
Phoebe was talking about in terms of

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.599
intimacy that

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.639
um

00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:20.400
I can see that if it's a justification

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.160
system it's larger than

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.139
my personal

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:29.639
being and it's a way that it's more like

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.760
propositional or it's more

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.500
um

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.360
a way of actually

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.180
maybe being more intimate

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.039
um yeah and they and they get very

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.200
institutionalized actually I'll actually

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.500
use a an example so I was at my mom's

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.899
all day yesterday most of the day today

00:08:48.899 --> 00:08:51.180
and my sister's like a really great

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.760
nurse okay and so my mom's really old

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.040
and she's my mom had a hard day

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.320
yesterday so my sister's like call the

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.940
emergency department you have to call

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.800
you have to call an ambulance to get to

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.420
the emergency department in order to get

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.980
her to rehab

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.620
so she's like appealing to like what is

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.060
the best thing to do and she's

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.279
justifying it by this thing she's done

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:13.980
for hundreds of terminally ill patients

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.660
she works in the Cancer Ward with

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.080
elderlies and stuff and I said

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.720
I mean actually

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.339
because my mom been through this like

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.500
last year and we didn't want to wait

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.480
that long it wasn't a bad idea but I'm

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.779
like look I just don't have the time to

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:32.580
uh go through all that it was already

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.880
like five o'clock at night so I said you

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.740
know I gotta shuttle to come early in

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.040
the morning

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.500
and so I come early in the morning and

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.740
she's like the kitchen table because she

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.420
fell

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.279
and the reason why I'm laughing is

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:53.279
because I walk in and I could tell she

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:55.800
was actually in better shape

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.959
the fact that she'd Fallen then she was

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.120
yesterday because yesterday she spent 26

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.580
hours on the couch and that's why her

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.380
back hurt and she couldn't get up and

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.080
she was cognitively failing so I'm like

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.300
what are you doing under there

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.779
then she's like I fell I'm like how long

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.820
you been there she's like 20 25 minutes

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.800
I'm like does your back feel better and

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.899
she's like yeah because instead of

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:21.720
laying on the couch for 26 minutes she

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.480
was letting the floor waiting for me

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.500
right

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.920
so you see I'm not appealing to any

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.740
justification system of why I'm doing

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.040
what I'm doing uh she had a pretty good

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.600
day

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.760
um but I'm not faulting my sister

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.279
because you know there's institutions

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:43.680
and at a certain point I mean it's great

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.779
because when she got really bad last

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:47.640
year my sister gets on the phone she

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.220
gets all her favors called in you get

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.079
into all the right places you know so

00:10:54.079 --> 00:10:59.899
so that's like the difference between

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.760
something and something the difference

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.920
between something and something now I

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.839
mean I wouldn't been laughing at my mom

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:09.120
for being on the floor but I'm telling

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.480
you she was she just looked so much or

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.860
more alive

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.200
and when I tried to get her up she had a

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.000
lot of strength to help then she did

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.980
yesterday when she was sitting on the

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.680
couch for 26 hours it almost killed her

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.519
so

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.640
so like like

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.880
my sister sees it through the lens uh oh

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.800
and this is gonna happen and this is

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.560
gonna happen and it happens but I see it

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.060
through the lens of yeah that happened

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.140
but

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.800
I don't know like whatever I'll go there

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.560
tomorrow and see and she did send me a

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.360
note today she thought I did the right

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.920
thing you know so so

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.300
a lot of the reason why people get on

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.120
the phone and send their family member

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.100
to a nursing home is because they want

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.399
to justify

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:04.680
their their response

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.519
I can't just I have no justification for

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.680
why

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.940
I let my mom

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.940
to stay at home tonight even those shoes

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.800
no do you know what I'm saying so like

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.820
like so so in a way it's good that we

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.920
have justification systems it's Solid

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.200
Ground to stand on

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.600
um but to be Beyond justification

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.820
systems there's a little bit of kind of

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.160
it's extremely unconventional it's it's

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.920
experimental ground right so because

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.980
when you experiment that way

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.420
uh

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.760
let's say I came in the morning I

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.860
actually was driving in I'm like what if

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.860
she's dead like then you can't justify

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.480
yourself because you had you didn't

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.300
follow protocol you didn't have any idea

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.880
what you were doing

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.980
um and so it is a collective thing you

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.839
see how it's really a collective thing

00:13:00.839 --> 00:13:03.120
it helps you

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.560
um it gets you off the hook uh for your

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.399
guess work otherwise in reality we're

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.680
doing guesswork you know and it's kind

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.200
of an interesting person who wants to do

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.740
guesswork

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:27.019
is that more helpful

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:30.839
Bonnie

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.880
yeah so that's how it works

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.680
thank you

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.839
it seems to me that what you're talking

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:45.480
about is lying on a shared map or a

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.920
shared uh way of contextualizing what I

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.240
do so that I don't have to risk

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.480
trusting how life is moving through me

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.380
and trusting being suspending

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.480
something like

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.700
she needs to go to the hospital because

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.220
it doesn't feel right and it's hard to

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.200
have a justification a shared

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.399
justification system for Life showing up

00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:16.740
in the moment

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:22.279
um in unscripted ways and uh

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.019
and for participating in something and

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:30.120
and my being

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.079
uh being uh responding to and being

00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:36.480
aroused by

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.139
um something Beyond me that isn't the

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:44.459
shared consensual agreement field

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:47.820
um but that includes shared consensual

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.279
if if you're with other people who want

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.620
to play that way

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.800
um

00:14:55.079 --> 00:14:56.940
but it feels like

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.519
a cop out for

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.519
um

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.699
trusting

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:10.019
you know the life comes to meet us that

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:12.300
life is alive and that there's and and

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.100
trusting the possibility of something

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.519
new in the moment even if it means

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:21.440
falling down to find it

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.820
I and I'll say I thought justification

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.160
systems was more like

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.699
creating a a schema to make sense of the

00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:35.820
world so that for me when I read in

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.199
depth all of John Herron's stuff

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:44.220
it gave me a way to chart myself in the

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.940
wild

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.220
to have a relationship beyond what I

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.279
knew before and and it gave me enough

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:52.860
that I could continually

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.279
make myself Anew in relationship to the

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.519
Wild and then after a while it felt like

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:02.600
I don't actually need this chart anymore

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.480
I'm interested in playing with

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.240
um not knowing and not making sense

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.880
because there's enough in place

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.860
that I can play beyond that and not uh

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.240
be lost

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.860
in the way that I might have been in the

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.380
class so that's a different

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.420
way that I understood justification

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.279
system probably because I didn't read as

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:29.339
closely as Stanford no no it's the same

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:31.860
thing it's just that it's a it's just a

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.699
much more it's a smaller uh more

00:16:35.699 --> 00:16:38.579
eclectic justification system right I

00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:41.579
mean if the whole world adopted John

00:16:41.579 --> 00:16:43.560
Herron's justification system and then

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.019
it became institutionalized which how

00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:48.180
that could happen I don't know then it

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.399
would seem like this larger thing but

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:53.100
yeah it's a shared John Herron had a

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.320
small community not that's you know not

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.220
insignificant that understood experience

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.240
and Justified certain

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.419
interpretations and through the his

00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:09.120
system so that that was a justification

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.100
system so that's what I'm saying it's

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.059
not necessarily

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.959
bad or good or bad

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:21.079
um um

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:25.280
their their

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:28.020
useful until they're not useful right

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.000
they work until they don't work

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.720
it seems to me that religions are

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.780
in the initially

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.380
in the an expression of an attempt to

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.100
move beyond the fixity of of living and

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.039
and into mystery and how do we how do we

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:49.320
have an ongoing relationship with

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.500
mystery and then those things become

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.919
codified and justified in a way that uh

00:17:55.919 --> 00:17:58.500
are are power based or whatever and then

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.440
and then and then the original

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.400
disappears for the most part

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:06.840
yeah and the problem with justification

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.660
systems is they compete right so if I'm

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.120
against abortion because of a religious

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.299
claim and you're someone who worked for

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:17.880
women's rights forever and you just keep

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.980
telling me but it's legal it's legal or

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.200
it's not legal or whatever but when it

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.240
was legal then you have just two

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.059
competing justification systems and

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.760
people are just

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.320
appealing to the justification system

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.840
many people aren't really actually

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.700
touching

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.419
base with with with their own feelings

00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:43.140
or an intimate exploration

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.880
um so

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.000
um

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.670
[Music]

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.799
justification is uh it's a good example

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:59.820
for why I come here in this sense

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.160
I long ago 20 years or more gave up

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.500
trying to figure out who I am but who

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.200
I'm not fascinates me you know there's

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.940
oh no I'm not that and I'm not that I'm

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.860
not that oh there's that no not that

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.700
either

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.160
and sometimes you know I have an

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.960
experience and the words associated with

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.000
arise I go oh those things are connected

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.100
in this case

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.679
going through justification pointed out

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:25.740
the Contours of it now I know how it

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.980
feels not what it is but it has a it has

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.320
a general feeling in my body now there

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.940
may be different kinds of justifications

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.580
that I but I know how my normal

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.280
justification pattern feels so anytime I

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.440
feel like oh they're expressing that way

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.240
today and that way and there's that way

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.160
and there's that way so if for me it's

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.280
like once I know the feeling I can start

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.260
to see all the forms that it shows up in

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.900
and that is extremely valuable and

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.580
that's why I come here I don't have to

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.559
remember a lot of stuff I just got to

00:19:55.559 --> 00:19:57.360
get a sense of what it feels like in my

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.700
body and then recognize it every time I

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.080
feel that

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.480
yeah that's why it's included because it

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.400
has a biomarker

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.700
right it has a buyer motor oh now I'm in

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.380
this state or I'm in this whatever

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.760
feeling oh this is what is is

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.880
the thing you're doing now whatever yeah

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.780
excellent

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.580
it almost feels like it has like a

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.799
it's like oh yeah like that makes sense

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:47.340
like the cop pulled the woman over and

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.799
then talking like oh yeah okay like I

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.600
don't know just kind of

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.760
to me it feels almost like a little

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.039
I don't know just like people I don't

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:01.679
know like Common Sense maybe I don't

00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:05.360
know it's kind of like a warm feeling

00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:11.340
yeah I mean if there wasn't any just

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.100
share justification then can you imagine

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.200
how long that conversation would have to

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.000
be then you have to say but you know all

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.880
the life of my job if the other person

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.059
only had the justification system of a

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:26.520
robot which is one of the problems with

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.640
robots policing things it would be like

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.220
you're speeding I gotta pull you over I

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.799
gotta tow your car away

00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:37.460
so

00:21:37.679 --> 00:21:40.280
when you can appeal to a different

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.200
justification system then you have

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.559
more more uh understanding but if a cop

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.760
is just like a robot

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.559
that's programmed just to do one thing

00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:57.900
catch feeders

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.340
um then

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.679
sliding across different justification

00:22:01.679 --> 00:22:03.480
systems you're not going to really find

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.200
any common common understanding there

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.659
right is it like

00:22:09.659 --> 00:22:11.340
you don't have to go through all the

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.980
little like points to make your case

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.380
like a lawsuit yeah yeah you just say my

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.840
child is bleeding to death like okay

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.900
that's a moral justification

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.740
um

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.059
and he and and a human being

00:22:29.059 --> 00:22:32.340
mostly slips right into that

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.740
slips through that to one from one

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.700
system to an X

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.919
and so that's the connection to the

00:22:40.919 --> 00:22:44.039
body's sensory motor system

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:48.320
like my child is bleeding to death

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.000
we respond

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.980
with the body

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.860
to a statement like that

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.820
yeah and the justification system is a

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.500
virtual

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.799
place we go to satisfy certain arousal

00:23:04.799 --> 00:23:06.659
States

00:23:06.659 --> 00:23:09.000
right so we have an arousal State we

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.960
don't go to

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:14.520
I mean you could

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.000
take your child out and show the cough

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.360
but you don't go to external perception

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.159
you jump to a very complex virtual

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:28.260
construction which is which is not just

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.080
virtual perception but mental models and

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:37.400
blah blah blah so uh in in

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:42.360
so part of that Loop a lot of things can

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.159
get satisfied by the justification

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:47.039
system the problem is like people are

00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:49.380
there's so many competing justification

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.960
systems now and there's the internet

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.700
that that is breaking down you know like

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.700
like

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.500
what if

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.400
what if

00:24:04.679 --> 00:24:07.440
what can replace the justification

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.740
system at at scale the problem the thing

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.299
that's good about the justification

00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:15.179
system is that it exists at scale right

00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:17.580
whether it's John Herron's group or the

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.039
whole country or whatever

00:24:20.039 --> 00:24:22.860
its power is that it can

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.860
exist at scale

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.539
um

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:30.679
yeah so

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.539
but as far as I know animals don't

00:24:36.539 --> 00:24:38.760
justify

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.720
um I mean certainly not linguistically

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.299
narratively conceptually

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:49.520
um because we can

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.440
you know we're cross modal synesthetes

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.720
we probably could find something in the

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.460
animal kingdom that we say oh that's

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.460
kind of like a justification but I don't

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.220
that's the only module where it really

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.360
sticks out as something that humans do

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.799
collectively that

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:09.659
um

00:25:09.659 --> 00:25:12.780
doesn't seem to happen

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.340
um

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.480
at the animal level

00:25:18.299 --> 00:25:22.799
do we need justification systems like

00:25:22.799 --> 00:25:26.900
just thinking of like Alternatives like

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.980
if I'm like thinking about this properly

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.120
like just doing going via like your AFX

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.200
and

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.340
what you're feeling like

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.200
I mean I suppose

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.240
you could create in a culture like that

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.820
is the justification system like oh I'm

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:49.500
just going by my effects and feelings

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.620
um

00:25:51.659 --> 00:25:54.440
yeah

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:57.960
yeah it gets crazy so let's look at this

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.279
is surprising that we're talking about

00:25:59.279 --> 00:26:01.140
this but look at let's look at the Trump

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.240
indictment does everybody know about the

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.640
Trump indictment

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.900
again he's indicted for conspiracy and

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.080
what is his defense

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.600
it's a First Amendment defense

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.200
because there's many precedents that uh

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.840
you can't be

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.539
imprisoned or convicted for lying

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:28.440
right so his justification is I lied

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.900
okay well over

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.820
the first line is is uh protected under

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.159
the First Amendment right

00:26:38.159 --> 00:26:41.039
now you get into Gobbledy book and The

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:43.140
Gobbledy book is well

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.200
most you have to use language to commit

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.080
fraud you have to use language to commit

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.640
conspiracy

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.240
so it's not I mean this is like the

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.720
postmodern nightmare being played out on

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.659
the federal scene at the highest level

00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:04.320
of indictment ever like

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.720
um it's you know it actually it even

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.320
trumps the Clinton defends what the word

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.940
is is right so like like once you start

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.620
getting into

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.140
foreign

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.539
this realm it gets it's a very slippery

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:25.440
it's very very slippery slope

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.700
um so

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:32.400
you this is exactly what you see is you

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.659
have

00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:37.200
uh one party justifying it by the fact

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.980
that lying is a First Amendment right in

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.400
this country

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.559
and the other part is saying well you're

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:49.200
not indicted for lying you're indicted

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.440
for conspiracy

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.559
conspiracy conspiratorial actions which

00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:59.000
happen to be speech Acts

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.799
and it's very and so the question is

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:08.400
what is exactly

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.279
let's let's pretend that the whole thing

00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:13.440
is not politically motivated let's say

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.039
this is a real thought

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:19.919
a real thing happening for some people

00:28:19.919 --> 00:28:22.020
it is real but

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:26.360
no what is exactly being decided here

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.760
you know and it's it's being decided in

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.740
the arm of the government called The

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.659
Justice right

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:38.220
because it's all about justification so

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.220
um

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.320
it's an interesting question

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.740
um

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.539
I'm curious when you say hi it's nice to

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:16.860
be here again

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.840
it's weird because I've been watching it

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.600
so I feel like I have been here but I

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.960
haven't that's weird it's weird

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.899
um sometimes I am I was curious because

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:30.960
don't if somebody kills somebody but

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.059
because they have an affects train like

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:35.399
it's like they catch their Partners

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:37.559
having sex with somebody else

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:40.080
they're they're protected isn't there

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.539
like the justification is a little bit

00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:46.500
uh it'll allows it gives them space to

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.899
do that basically it's saying you can't

00:29:48.899 --> 00:29:50.820
handle that amount of energy in your

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.860
body so therefore it's okay to kill

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.559
somebody else like isn't something

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:58.799
but it's not okay but the penalty is

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.840
less than if you sit there and

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.679
cold-bloodedly premeditate their murder

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:06.899
um so Crimes of Passion are still you

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:12.179
can go to prison for 10 12 years uh

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:15.539
and depending upon whether you rehabil

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:17.820
Crimes of Passion that people are are

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.399
are fairly easily rehabilitated

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.380
um but so so yes it's taken into

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.480
consideration

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.159
um but it's not it's not okay so then so

00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:33.659
then someone yeah maybe it's not okay

00:30:33.659 --> 00:30:35.640
but I was just thinking from your from

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.740
the language of the pop-up school that's

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.380
actually what that's justifying is that

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.799
it's an agreement that it's hard to be

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:46.020
with that amount of energy exactly so

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:48.480
there's somehow there's a whole system

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.539
of just the whole penal system is it

00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:53.640
just a Victoria system

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.980
around all kinds of of distinctions

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.460
in trying to standardize it to someone I

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.100
mean there's a great quite a in some it

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.720
goes back and forth but in the U.S

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.080
there's there's some degree

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.899
[Music]

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:14.700
there's some degrees of freedom for the

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.399
for the judge so she said you know she

00:31:17.399 --> 00:31:22.620
can sentence from eight to 48 years

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.340
and so she can feel the context but she

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.620
can't sentence less than eight or more

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.620
than 48 or something like that

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.059
um

00:31:33.059 --> 00:31:36.360
and then yeah so

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.039
yeah so those are that is taken into a

00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:43.260
fountain certainly mental insanity is

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.179
taken into account but that's also a

00:31:45.179 --> 00:31:48.179
slippery slope you know it's serial

00:31:48.179 --> 00:31:51.419
killer is in a way a mentally insane

00:31:51.419 --> 00:31:53.520
person but they could be kind of

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.000
rationally in control

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.799
um so

00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:01.580
um yeah

00:32:06.539 --> 00:32:10.919
but Crimes of Passion are a certain case

00:32:10.919 --> 00:32:14.520
it's versus premeditated right so it's

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.410
manslaughter versus premeditary

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.799
[Music]

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:21.720
one is more like dealing with the effect

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.640
stream of the moment and the other one

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.320
is more

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.480
um

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:30.120
just justifying and stay in the room you

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.960
know to justify you had time

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.799
um

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:38.039
less remorse like people who like just

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:39.960
lash out

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.779
they don't even know why they'll report

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:45.419
they don't even I don't even they don't

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:47.580
I did it I didn't eat and they they feel

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.140
horrible they don't even know why they

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.960
did it you know there's a it's they got

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.480
overwhelmed yeah and that's the thing is

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.399
the chances of them doing it again are

00:32:56.399 --> 00:32:59.580
very are very awesome because they don't

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.419
want to kill anyone

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.640
um

00:33:09.179 --> 00:33:12.179
if we get like things like

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:15.360
you know Murder and stuff from these

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.360
affect streams

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.840
to me then that sounds almost like these

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.480
are not

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.360
always the best things to be following

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.799
sort of

00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.840
I guess my understanding before was kind

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.799
of like

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:34.799
you know yeah we don't get murder from

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:37.080
athletes

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.740
okay

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.100
um it is very hard to imagine someone

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.960
wanting to murder someone without a

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.320
narrative

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:52.500
right so dog walks in he sees his his

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.740
the dog he's another dog

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.539
I feel like get mad but he's not gonna

00:33:57.539 --> 00:33:59.880
like sit around and you know you know

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.860
they get a fight

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.260
um but mostly what happens with people

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:07.080
is like he's cheating on me and my

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.740
identity and we promised and that is

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:15.839
more fuel than just sexual aggression in

00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:19.440
in general that's what is involved in

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.440
crimes of passion is not yeah their

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.500
bodies are a mess but it's this this

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.599
other thing

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.460
um that fuels

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:33.359
feels the the fire really

00:34:33.359 --> 00:34:35.220
um so

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.379
I would not say that affects which are

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:39.899
part of our animal nature is responsible

00:34:39.899 --> 00:34:42.179
for murder

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.320
um

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.700
um

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.399
killing yes I mean but

00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:50.580
hey you know animal skill to eat other

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.500
animals and we kill a lot of animals to

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.240
eat them but that's not a crime of

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.260
passion that's that's something else and

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.460
um so

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.160
if if you

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.580
um if you really notice most of the

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.380
passion in Crimes of Passion are

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.859
narratives

00:35:09.859 --> 00:35:11.960
seething

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.359
you know like

00:35:15.359 --> 00:35:18.500
and to tell

00:35:18.839 --> 00:35:20.000
like

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.280
there goes

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.740
I guess my mind goes to like being able

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.020
to distinguish between these narratives

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.099
versus affects and like as a felt sense

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:34.640
like

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.599
like like I've like right now there's I

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:42.839
have a a friend and

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:46.640
or something and

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:51.599
is it would a difference be like

00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:54.480
being run by sort of a narrative

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.579
feel almost like sometimes I feel like

00:35:56.579 --> 00:35:59.880
yeah I get maybe some Rage or hate or

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.320
something but then

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.140
it doesn't it feels almost like it

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.780
doesn't feel like

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.800
it almost feels like feeble or like

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.560
something off with it like it doesn't

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.320
feel quite genuine like all this there's

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.780
something else like would that be a

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.060
distinction whereas if it was an affect

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.099
it would be more like oh

00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:26.040
like that's the feeling or that's what

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.320
it is more solid

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.960
so if we go back to the definition of

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.400
anger

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.560
anger

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.579
um

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:38.940
is there's a boundary that is being

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.180
crossed so you might be angry that

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.180
your friend is dating the woman you want

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.280
to date because you put a boundary

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.220
around her like you think there's you've

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.680
got a her in a container

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.720
and that boundary has been crossed and

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.020
the question is is that boundary

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.079
like what is that boundary do you want

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:02.579
to try to

00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:06.480
preserve that boundary but it's not them

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.460
that you're angry at it's the question

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.740
is whether or not what does that

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.579
boundary mean to you so if I'm a mom I

00:37:14.579 --> 00:37:18.119
put a boundary around my child like big

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:19.800
time

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.560
Big Time boundary you're not gonna

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.240
with my child

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.320
so when I get angry I say oh I know what

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.800
that is they're they're pushing on that

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.020
boundary good for me I want that

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.240
boundary so the question is is the

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.280
boundary worth what's going on in your

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.119
life

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:43.560
and can you take responsibility for that

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.920
um and why why are you you know and if

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.320
you're putting a boundary around a grown

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.720
individual that's something else to

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.060
think about why can I put a boundary

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.920
around

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.020
an adult human

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.260
well that's a maybe a little weird you

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.119
know what I'm saying and even when you

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:09.440
have a child at some point the boundary

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.119
you have to let it go you know you have

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:13.560
to let it

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.380
the boundary you put around it

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:19.260
at first your actual physical body as a

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.619
mother is the boundary around your child

00:38:22.619 --> 00:38:26.579
and then that becomes

00:38:26.579 --> 00:38:30.300
and then as your child grows it's like

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.220
where's this boundary that I'm

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.920
constantly upholding like is this useful

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.960
is this correct is it in the right

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.300
relationship too

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.760
this person

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.760
um yeah so putting a boundary around

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.040
another adult human being that's kind of

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.599
interesting like

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:50.880
what's going on but what's going on with

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.119
that

00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:56.599
it was more like

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.859
like at work

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:03.300
like I know

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.780
you know we have like no vaping or

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.820
whatever

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.400
work and then I know one person was like

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.900
oh I'm just gonna go to the washroom and

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.460
bait and to me when I heard that I was

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.240
like

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.820
oh that feels like

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.339
well hey like what are we doing like hey

00:39:20.339 --> 00:39:24.359
like this is what you know we agreed on

00:39:24.359 --> 00:39:26.520
or something it's like I don't know it

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.780
just felt

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.119
right so that was a boundary this person

00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:33.000
was crossing yeah

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.070
okay

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:38.169
[Music]

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.780
anger is always related to some boundary

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.760
that's being maintained or not

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.400
maintained or violated or

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.280
in question or

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.200
yeah and I didn't know how to

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.940
because I thought about it afterwards

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.859
and I was like

00:40:07.859 --> 00:40:10.079
I didn't know how to like I felt like I

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:11.820
had to have a reason or give reasons and

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.359
I couldn't I don't know why I felt like

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:18.119
I couldn't get at them but yeah yeah so

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:20.099
like somebody can come in with the

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:22.260
person the whole justification system

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.660
but you're talking about something much

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.920
more

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.900
simple like the fact that somehow you

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.540
bought into this boundary or you're part

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.780
of this boundary it and and

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.420
the whole point is to you know whether

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.220
or not it's useful to you that's all

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:46.800
and and to to be uh you know if it's

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:48.660
useful to you then

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.820
you're not so confused when you and

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.619
you're not so

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:54.599
uh

00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:57.060
it doesn't cost you a lot to just smack

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.520
the guy in the face and say you

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.079
you're not vaping here

00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:02.520
yeah

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.060
it's just because you're satisfied with

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.280
the fact that you're

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.060
um

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:11.339
you're upholding that boundary

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:13.700
yeah

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.440
yeah like when I when I question it and

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.180
get try to get to the reasons that

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:21.720
that's where I feel like oh like it

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.000
doesn't feel so

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.099
like like you know we don't do that here

00:41:26.099 --> 00:41:27.540
it feels more like oh I'm not sure

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.560
anymore yeah

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.900
I just want to know that in my

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.420
experience not always but seems like

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.160
often enough

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:45.060
anger is a volume and velocity of

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.480
sadness or grief that is arising and

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.700
somehow it transitions into anger it

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.099
seems like the same energy that's moving

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:55.500
really fast and there's a whole lot of

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.220
it

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.280
and then at the core of it

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.040
is grief that it appears to be often the

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.560
case as I've observed it over time maybe

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:07.440
not always yeah if this may not be

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.960
correct but in my experience this is

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.940
very common

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.079
on men

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:16.980
because men aren't allowed to be in

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:21.300
grief so the energy quickly uh

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.540
shape shifts into anger

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.359
the boundaries that that is there is

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:30.180
you're not allowed to be in grief

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.660
so so you're angry at the boundary that

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.119
Society puts on you the opposite happens

00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:39.900
with with women when anger is the

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.380
authentic uh emotion they go into grief

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.900
and sadness because socially they're not

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.480
allowed to be angry so this is quite

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.180
common and it goes very fast like you

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.940
said it goes very fast

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.200
um

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.240
um this may not be the case for you but

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.180
I but I've seen this many times

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.400
um and

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.460
um

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.099
so what is what is if you're saying the

00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:10.859
authentic emotion is grief

00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:13.800
and uh

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.960
the anger might be like I'm not allowed

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.060
to grieve there's a social boundary

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.800
there for me

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.500
somebody put a barrier up there between

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:25.440
me and that

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.420
um and for women is is quite often the

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.099
opposite

00:43:29.099 --> 00:43:31.560
uh it's why women get passive aggressive

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.960
because they quickly get angry that's

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.140
authentic and then they go into weepy

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.240
Moshi

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.520
things that it gets very confusing like

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.500
I thought you were angry and now you're

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.200
like devastated I don't know what to do

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.480
with that

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.300
well part of it for me is and I I've

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.920
noticed this in a couple of instances

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.140
but there was a moment of trauma when I

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.160
was young

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.000
and that I made a rule about it and when

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.099
the rule is violated anywhere in my

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:05.040
environment it's it's almost like a

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.720
protective measure to keep from

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.880
re-experiencing the trauma which is a

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.380
kind of grief

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.319
and that's part of why I have those two

00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:16.319
Associated yeah because the rule is a

00:44:16.319 --> 00:44:19.760
boundary right yeah

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.800
no you go ahead

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.220
no yeah okay uh I was just circulating

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.760
on the uh justification system

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.540
and how

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.800
how that then hinders us from you know

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.280
getting the FX stream and truly

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.720
embodying

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.579
the

00:44:50.579 --> 00:44:51.300
um

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.520
the thing that we are then meant to

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.800
strive for I guess

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.560
the and I I know yeah I was just

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.079
wondering if the justification system

00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:06.060
inherently uh you know has the potential

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.500
to inherently disembody those

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.220
subscribing to the justification system

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.140
um which I thought was kind of

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:20.700
interesting and my mind went to you know

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.920
during covet you know you had to have

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.099
your vaccination or because you know and

00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:27.960
there were all these reasons and all of

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.180
a sudden it wasn't a meaningful debate

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.579
anymore it was just that you know you

00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:34.200
had to you had to support the

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.319
justification system

00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:39.180
um and I you know when Matt mentioned

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.099
about The Vaping I thought you know if

00:45:41.099 --> 00:45:43.680
you if there is a rule about there's no

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.200
vaping and you just accept that sweet

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.240
and then when you get confronted with

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.040
somebody going against a justification

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.280
system you might not be

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.500
empowered to or embodied to really

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.900
properly respond in that moment and only

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.579
kind of get

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:02.160
um you know confronted with hey

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.260
something is arousing for me that I that

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:06.480
I'm I'm now I'm jumping to this

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.920
conclusion

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.140
rather than embodying it or having

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.240
embodied it and knowing that the

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.180
conclusion is that uh and that creates

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.339
some kind of sub-optimal thing

00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:20.640
sorry a bit wordy but um yeah I did

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.440
think it was quite interesting even

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.500
though maybe only for myself no no

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.900
that's how that's that's exactly the

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.260
richness in the question like we swim in

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.140
justification systems really as a

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:36.180
collective and one of the questions is

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.460
uh

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.680
so the justification system is helpful

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.760
because

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.880
it's it's it's scaled and it's it's

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.819
shared easily and it's scaled right

00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:51.060
um so the question is well well what

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.520
other aspect of the human condition is

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.700
shared easily and and can scale

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:57.300
um

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:59.460
maybe scaling is a problem that's always

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.520
a question but but

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.260
um

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:08.280
people often pivot you know when the

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.440
situation is just too confusing

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.359
what else what other recourses an

00:47:12.359 --> 00:47:15.900
individual have you just you just

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.460
um

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.800
rely on the justification system and

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.839
also the you know the other thing is

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.180
like I was at the bank today

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.359
and my bank just got a big upgrade

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:29.700
because they emerge with someone else so

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.960
now like there's like three party

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:38.640
authentication and you have to you know

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.800
it's all very gotten much more high tech

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.420
and

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.579
I just needed I went to the bank because

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:45.960
I needed something

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.300
um we call it uh notarized you know

00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.859
where you sign something some of the

00:47:49.859 --> 00:47:52.500
witnesses you sign and they put the seal

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.720
but there was like four people ahead of

00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:57.240
me and it took so long because they were

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.220
all

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.280
60 to 70 years and older

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.260
they didn't have cell phones they were

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.660
locked up and there was like

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.119
and the guy was like you have to go home

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.980
and

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.640
answer your phone and get the code

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.000
you know his wife he can't hear his wife

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.560
wouldn't understand what was doing

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.359
doesn't have kids that can help them

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:24.780
like he just get locked out the the

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.480
technological justification system just

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.119
locks out

00:48:29.119 --> 00:48:32.579
you know whole generations of people and

00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:35.460
it's generational but also

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.680
um economic right because if you're you

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.480
could be a young person growing up in a

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.359
rural or inner city and not have any

00:48:42.359 --> 00:48:46.140
idea what all the subscription is

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.040
um and the guy the young guy who was the

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.480
the

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.660
uh you know the manager the bank manager

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.700
he was really patient with the guy and

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.280
he kept on saying over and over and over

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:03.359
what to do and the guy the

00:49:03.359 --> 00:49:07.500
it was just there was no way that

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.400
that person was understanding what had

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.940
just happened in reality uh

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.640
and yeah it was very

00:49:22.619 --> 00:49:24.780
you see this everywhere it's really kind

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.280
of sad

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.079
um because the justification systems

00:49:28.079 --> 00:49:30.000
become extremely abstract and

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.640
sophisticated and increasingly turned

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:38.040
over to computational machines right so

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.540
um that's why I had to get a smartphone

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:41.220
because everything I was trying to do

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.819
online I needed to scan barcodes and

00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:48.140
the workaround for that is is impossible

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.180
and so that's a kind of justification

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:54.780
system now that's not conceptual based

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.599
it's it's

00:49:56.599 --> 00:49:59.880
technological Security based

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.859
um it's extremely sophisticated

00:50:11.579 --> 00:50:13.980
so so they're shared justification

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:15.720
systems and there's also internal

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.480
justification systems right and it's the

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.060
internal justification system

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:25.200
also what makes us jump from you know at

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.540
an early stage in the arousal phase to

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.119
the uh you know the anticipated end

00:50:30.119 --> 00:50:32.040
state is and then the justification

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:34.800
system makes us jump there is that kind

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:38.339
of how it works exactly yeah in in our

00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:42.480
society and what about in our person

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.420
yeah but it's the kinds of people we are

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.579
today it's not like some

00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:51.359
natural law of organism or even of

00:50:51.359 --> 00:50:52.800
humans

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.680
um it's just it's enculturated in

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.420
modernity really

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.960
so if we were to go back to Nature

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.380
um and be truly in touch with you know

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.780
uh and and everything we do is always

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.400
embodied

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.980
no justification system would exist

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.619
internally

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:16.020
yeah I mean there's no real if you're so

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:18.420
low yeah but there's no real going back

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.819
it's the question is what other kinds of

00:51:23.819 --> 00:51:24.780
um

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:27.619
things can be shared

00:51:27.619 --> 00:51:30.559
collectively that function

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:33.900
sort of to take care of the benefits of

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.280
that

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.800
um so so we read during the

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.700
justification module we read Obama's

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.280
Nobel Prize expect

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.460
acceptance speech which is the most

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.960
bombastic piece of justification's

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.960
beautiful speech he goes from justifying

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.839
the just War to just saying we have to

00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:56.579
justify peace

00:51:56.579 --> 00:52:00.119
right like it's just like not from Saint

00:52:00.119 --> 00:52:05.579
Thomas Aquinas like and then so it's and

00:52:05.579 --> 00:52:07.760
then we read bio

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.040
kamalafes uh black lives matter but to

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.800
whom and he tells stories and he does

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.740
this and he does that and his metaphors

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:20.040
and he's in the art of persuasion but

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.160
he's not using justification in the way

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.920
we know it we we just noticed that

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.079
there's something different going on we

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:31.319
couldn't really name it and so in that

00:52:31.319 --> 00:52:33.900
module we have to say well as humans we

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.140
are in the art of persuasion

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.740
um but it seems like justification

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.920
systems are are like many other things

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:47.400
breaking down and the main the main

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.980
thrust to replacing them is

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:53.819
technological uh Ai and you have to

00:52:53.819 --> 00:52:55.200
justify things

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.040
to the algorithm right so this gets very

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.180
scary because God forbid you lose you

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:07.140
know like like when I bought my first

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:08.520
Volvo

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.520
the VIN number

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.880
on the metal piece in the car and the

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.760
VIN number on the manufacturer's

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.119
certificate were they didn't match there

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:24.540
was some clerical mistake but you go and

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.640
you talk to a person and they're like oh

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.619
well obviously it's the same car blah

00:53:28.619 --> 00:53:30.420
blah blah but

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:34.559
you know how computers are that's that's

00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:37.740
a deal breaker for a computer one digit

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.540
is off and it'd be like no

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.079
right no

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:50.220
so you see the the uh yeah so that's in

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.319
the that's an alternative that's that

00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:54.900
we're moving toward away from kind of

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.119
conventional justification which has

00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:59.940
some jurors and slippery slope and

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.920
language and all this stuff it's gotten

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.200
more and more sophisticated but it's

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.440
kind of used up and what what Society is

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.059
putting in its place is this

00:54:09.059 --> 00:54:11.040
technological justification and the

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.460
question is is there another way

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.940
to go in small groups there's a lot of

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.000
ways to go the Quakers have interesting

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.760
justification systems they have a

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.280
handful of rules and then they process

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.099
process you know the individual gets to

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.079
talk and the elders the whole

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:32.940
congregations that surround and they

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.980
process and process and processes along

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:39.920
drawn out process it doesn't scale but

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.720
we're you know we didn't have any

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.180
solutions we were just kind of looking

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:48.180
at it as

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:48.960
um

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.559
yeah

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:59.040
what's the movement toward

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.319
um Ai and

00:55:01.319 --> 00:55:04.990
kind of you know non-human interaction

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:06.059
[Music]

00:55:06.059 --> 00:55:10.160
going to do to subjectivity

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:12.480
well people are going to become more

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.180
like machines

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.359
in fact I have this I have you know my

00:55:18.359 --> 00:55:20.640
agent in the machine I have one of the

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.880
founders of AI being simulated saying

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:26.640
exactly that the dangers

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.400
I I said this years ago in my medium

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.880
publication that that

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.220
machines haven't

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.160
it can be arguable that machines aren't

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.960
becoming more intelligent but people are

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.900
becoming more like machines and the case

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.940
is probably that but that the direction

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.040
is in both ways

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:50.220
so you standardize medicine

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.500
your doctor starts acting I mean you can

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.540
take my mom to the her general

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.520
practitioner he just gets on his

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.819
computer he he's useless why put a

00:55:59.819 --> 00:56:02.520
person between her and the Machine

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.520
well because that's just the phase we're

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.079
in pretty soon it'll just be the machine

00:56:07.079 --> 00:56:09.660
you know and so

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:11.579
um

00:56:11.579 --> 00:56:13.319
um this has been happening for a long

00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:16.980
time in terms of how kids write essays

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.099
and how they they you know

00:56:20.099 --> 00:56:25.440
uh their the the um yeah so people have

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.800
becoming we swim in we we swim in the

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.440
language of machines and

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.300
were becoming more and more like

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.280
machines so

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:36.119
um

00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:37.619
yeah

00:56:37.619 --> 00:56:39.359
that's what's happening the production

00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:42.300
of subjectivity is the human is becoming

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.980
the human interior is becoming more

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.200
machine-like

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:50.220
I just happen to read the summary of a

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.059
visit

00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:54.780
that I had last week to an orthopedist

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.280
and

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.099
the summary was nothing like the visit

00:56:59.099 --> 00:57:02.359
it said he prescribed an

00:57:02.359 --> 00:57:05.460
anti-inflammatory which I did not get it

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.640
said he you know I'm reading the thing

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.760
and it's all just boilerplate but it had

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.040
nothing to do with it was written right

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.520
by a Chachi it's just like

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.619
click here click here click it yeah and

00:57:21.619 --> 00:57:25.559
medicines right online for that and

00:57:25.559 --> 00:57:27.900
um the next thing that's online that's

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.520
have well finances has been heavily

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.800
algorithms have made most of the large

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:37.140
financial decisions for a long time now

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.880
I mean they just trade faster than

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:40.680
people can that's they make their own

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:41.640
decisions

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.380
and

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.559
um in fact you could not audit the the

00:57:46.559 --> 00:57:49.440
treasury of the United States

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.599
you couldn't audit it because it would

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:53.579
take you'd have to stop everything and

00:57:53.579 --> 00:57:56.460
it would take you 15 to 20 years to

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.220
audit it with the help of AI

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.800
it's just too big who knows what's being

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.440
paid for nobody knows

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.720
nobody knows it's too big

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.079
and then increasingly ai's medical

00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:12.480
decisions very steeped in medical

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.780
decisions and increasingly AI is going

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:19.319
to make judicial decisions based upon

00:58:19.319 --> 00:58:23.700
these uh technological security things

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.420
and the whole justification is that AI

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.859
is not biased

00:58:28.859 --> 00:58:31.020
you're not going to be a juror who's

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.780
like got any bias or read the newspaper

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.920
or falls in love with the celebrity

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.520
who's the celebrity killer or whatever

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.000
and and eventually

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.640
people will be thrown into that

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.099
uh world and their subjectivity will

00:58:50.099 --> 00:58:53.119
become like machines

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.079
um

00:58:55.079 --> 00:58:57.720
yeah that's that's pretty easy to see

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.319
it's already the case so

00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:03.380
um

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.859
and the thing is

00:59:07.859 --> 00:59:09.859
um

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:11.599
it's it's it's

00:59:11.599 --> 00:59:15.980
non-linear in the sense that

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.980
where that's true today will be less

00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.119
true in 50 years

00:59:24.059 --> 00:59:25.200
but

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.660
in the developing world because they're

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:28.880
becoming

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:33.119
increasingly they're urbanizing faster

00:59:33.119 --> 00:59:35.760
than the Western World in the Western

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.500
World we don't have any kids anymore and

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.180
this and that

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:43.140
um it will become that that Brave New

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.359
World will become realized in the third

00:59:45.359 --> 00:59:47.640
world

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.000
just at the time that the first world

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.720
quote unquote uh will be filled with

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:59.220
holes and punched to death and uh

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.720
probably uh examining something new

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.819
so it's not kind of like we'll go to

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:09.059
third world they're going to be uh

01:00:09.059 --> 01:00:11.400
indigenous and this and that now all the

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.220
uh Mo because you know you come in

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.640
they they they leap through

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.500
sell you know they lead through land

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.299
lines and this and that they go from

01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:23.819
like third world to like Brave New World

01:00:23.819 --> 01:00:25.380
really fast

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.859
and so uh the acceleration is going to

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:31.500
happen there

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.559
um although the West started it the

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.540
acceleration and the completion will

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.460
happen there

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.319
um so

01:00:40.319 --> 01:00:43.099
uh

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.040
Anna

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:00.240
wow this is I find it fascinating and a

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.920
lot is arising around that Tech

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.220
justification and around algorithms

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.799
around

01:01:07.799 --> 01:01:10.920
um the boundaries herself

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.280
and my I have a lot of questions only I

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.500
don't have any answers but my question

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.579
is what is enslavement

01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:23.280
um what is athlete's perception like

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.880
perceptual organs the sixth senses uh

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.520
introception proprioception exterior

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.280
section sorry

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.400
and then the unmediated cognition

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.660
so when I'm when I'm anchoring this

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.819
perception in the world with as the

01:01:41.819 --> 01:01:44.280
world's perception how is that linked

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.780
into boundaries

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:49.140
and then my perceptual organs when I

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.680
when I assume I know but because I think

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.460
I

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.160
for me all my organs have its own

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.680
Consciousness I know that I'm a

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.599
relationship to that

01:02:00.599 --> 01:02:05.000
so am I being up here

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:09.260
well probably not you so much

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.099
um

01:02:14.099 --> 01:02:19.079
so so I'm going to show you something I

01:02:19.079 --> 01:02:21.079
um

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:24.720
I get a show this is this it should help

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.059
you what you're saying obviously it's

01:02:27.059 --> 01:02:30.420
not an answer so if you draw like a

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.660
ladder here try like a ladder there and

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.819
in this ladder because remember we said

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:38.280
there's the nature of mind and there's

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.460
the kind of mind we have right so this

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.260
is the argument I sent this to Greg

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.640
Enriquez now here's like

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.420
uh uh Mind of a a worm and here we have

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.880
other animal minds and like we've been

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.819
saying and

01:02:56.819 --> 01:02:59.819
um so each one of these mutations in

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:02.280
evolution create a more sophisticated

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.180
mind and in this case I'm going to

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.180
highlight this mutation this this is

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.640
just sensory motor feedback

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.520
this is an animal that can simulate its

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.720
environment

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.059
this is an animal that can simulate

01:03:18.059 --> 01:03:21.420
hypothetical environments and here is

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.880
the animal that can simulate itself

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.059
that's human as far as we know animals

01:03:27.059 --> 01:03:29.160
can do all of these but as far as we

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.700
know only a human has a little

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.020
homunculus in their mind

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.960
uh that they mistake for their embodied

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:39.960
self and they live through that Avatar

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.960
okay so this is the human can simulate

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.180
themselves

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.420
so when you can simulate yourself you

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.460
can enter a justification system you

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.920
could say well what if you were a person

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.900
that killed someone or what if you know

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.020
what I'm saying now Greg Enriquez

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.599
puts

01:03:59.599 --> 01:04:04.559
the AI cyborg justification system as

01:04:04.559 --> 01:04:06.839
the Next Mutation

01:04:06.839 --> 01:04:11.280
and Consciousness and I say no the fact

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.040
that we can simulate ourselves and we

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.500
can speak doesn't mean everything we say

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.119
and simulate

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:21.660
is evolutionarily positive

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.480
right so there are some animals that

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.579
could simulate hypothetical environments

01:04:26.579 --> 01:04:28.260
and they went extinct because the

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.380
hypothetical environment so so the

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.900
difference between these mutations and

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.660
the Next Mutation in consciousness

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.240
it's not at the end of a justification

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.299
system it's not what we do with this new

01:04:42.299 --> 01:04:46.200
mutation that then goes on

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.220
to be the next it's it's a different

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.579
it's a different

01:04:52.579 --> 01:04:55.799
Dynamic Series right we can't possibly

01:04:55.799 --> 01:04:58.020
predict what this is any more than

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.359
before we could simulate you know you

01:05:00.359 --> 01:05:03.599
can't predict these things but he thinks

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:07.380
that the justification system is this

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:10.260
next wrong and up here is

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.940
the emerging of AI and humans into this

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:17.760
larger mind form and I'm trying to tell

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:21.059
them no that's the scenario that's on

01:05:21.059 --> 01:05:22.200
this path

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.260
and there's something else that can be

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.020
coming in The evolutionary mutation does

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:30.780
that make sense yeah I'm thinking what

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.480
happened to uh Suzanne cook reuter when

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.480
she did a sentence completion test and

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.400
um I I'm not sure who gave it to her but

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.319
one of the integral people think gave

01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.720
her the sentence completion test made by

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.960
aai and I think she said what the

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.359
is this this is who what kind of human

01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:51.960
uses so many words yeah she rated it at

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.740
3.5 yeah on stages on the stages model

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:58.680
so I'm very curious about algorithms and

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.079
the people who who just create those

01:06:01.079 --> 01:06:03.839
algorithms around the 3.5 Mark at the

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:06.839
moment and I'm very curious about

01:06:06.839 --> 01:06:08.880
the implications if I'm looking at that

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.640
ladder that makes a lot of sense because

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.940
you know there's so much more than than

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.520
an algorithm to something

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.880
and it has so much influence because its

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:23.940
capacity is just it's bleeding out in

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.880
everything like the bangs like my phone

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.980
like Wi-Fi my everything I am is almost

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.260
like creating a layer upon a layer upon

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.260
layer and almost taking away and that's

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.299
the question that stands with me from

01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.579
the beginning of our course what is

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:45.299
being taken away from us a lot yeah and

01:06:45.299 --> 01:06:47.099
that's what I feel is one of the biggest

01:06:47.099 --> 01:06:49.500
things that's taken away from me is

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.000
these layers that are being put upon

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.400
I can only speak for myself but there is

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.460
like I'm feeling I'm feeling devastated

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.760
at times like why can't I just be with

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.980
all the sensors Tory things that are

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.700
arising and just it's like it's like a

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.619
Orchestra all the time but I don't want

01:07:10.619 --> 01:07:12.720
to hear the orchestra of a helicopter

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.039
Chopper

01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:16.079
hoovering across my house in the middle

01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.760
of nature what the are you doing

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.740
here off you know

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.480
because you can and I think those things

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.940
and then it's being asked of me to stay

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.160
with that and integrate it but I don't

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.099
want to

01:07:31.099 --> 01:07:34.380
that's one of these boundaries put a

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.260
boundary around nature and say off

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:41.400
and that makes you mad but so these

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.319
boundaries are not it's not I'm not

01:07:43.319 --> 01:07:46.020
saying it's wrong to put a boundary

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.559
and get enraged uh but just just

01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:52.260
understand what you're doing and make it

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.599
obligate you know voluntary obligation

01:07:54.599 --> 01:07:56.460
toward it

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:59.339
um and a lot of times their boundaries

01:07:59.339 --> 01:08:02.160
and we get mad and they're like the

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.020
stupidest things we've

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:06.380
somehow been conditioned

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.660
on Facebook but the thing is it's just

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.700
like you're saying it's like it's just

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.460
young people think that the future

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.859
scenario without internet without this

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:23.460
without that like the model that plays

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.920
on the head is like how horrible life

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.620
must have been in the 40s or something

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.600
and I'm telling you

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.380
life was not worse in the 40s maybe I'll

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.000
I

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.179
there's many many things that have been

01:08:39.179 --> 01:08:41.940
robbed from Human Experience

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.779
and so like this whole part of the

01:08:45.779 --> 01:08:48.299
meeting crisis and this crisis and that

01:08:48.299 --> 01:08:51.000
crisis is getting people like

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.640
like all hyped up like what if our

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.679
supply chains you know like we used to

01:08:55.679 --> 01:08:58.679
eat mustard sandwiches and cucumber and

01:08:58.679 --> 01:09:01.319
butter on white toast

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:05.339
and we didn't know it was like cucumbers

01:09:05.339 --> 01:09:08.940
and you know it was fun we had fun

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.279
squishing the bread and

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:15.000
you know and God forbid people think

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.520
they're like they they like it's like

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.799
having AIDS or something if you go back

01:09:19.799 --> 01:09:22.980
to living like it was in the 40s it was

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.500
fun in the 40s we went to the woods and

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:29.520
started fires and filled caves and

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.160
yeah and

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.679
so this is but it's all hype you know

01:09:34.679 --> 01:09:39.540
it's all like like uh it's all fueled by

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:42.900
perverse and senses well Velveeta cheese

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.759
they didn't even have Velveeta cheese

01:09:44.759 --> 01:09:49.279
when I grew up craft though craft dad

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.020
um what do you know about Velveeta

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.640
cheese you were on like a freaking

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.340
commune

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.120
foreign

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.380
I just stayed out of a garden it was

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.219
before that

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:14.160
meat potatoes a soggy vegetable yeah I

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.920
hadn't seen a real brussels sprouts I

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.900
never even knew what a brussels sprouts

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.219
was

01:10:20.219 --> 01:10:22.860
growing up for fresh asparagus you

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.600
didn't you worked you didn't have

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.699
vitamin deficiencies because you didn't

01:10:26.699 --> 01:10:29.219
eat vitamin water and have like

01:10:29.219 --> 01:10:32.460
expensive organic food this is not the

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.820
way it actually works it's just all

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.820
advertising

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:58.020
not 100 sure how it relates

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.820
but I had this really interesting

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.719
conversation with somebody I work with

01:11:02.719 --> 01:11:07.340
who has a child who's 25 lives at home

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:11.100
plays video games all day is on a beige

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.380
diet

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:15.840
which means just eats white bread

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.500
chicken fries chips anything kind of

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.580
white beige-ish no vegetables please and

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.739
then

01:11:25.739 --> 01:11:30.120
um regularly doesn't sleep at all uh

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.460
during the night and then struggles to

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.420
go to work uh the next day because

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.719
um of mental health issues

01:11:39.719 --> 01:11:41.760
and

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.280
I was I was listening to it and

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.340
I was like you know

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.260
quite sad for the perception that the

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.780
young person had of

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.460
what it's

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.560
um you know was able to do to him to

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.840
themselves while thinking they would

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.719
also be able to maintain some of the

01:12:06.719 --> 01:12:10.340
expectations put on him her

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.679
by Society such as you know working if

01:12:13.679 --> 01:12:16.199
you're committing to a job

01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.699
um

01:12:17.699 --> 01:12:19.860
and I was also reflecting back on how

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.020
how my own Journey was where you know

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.320
you kind of yes you think you can do all

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.140
these extra things on top of what you're

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.980
what you you feel your obligation is and

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.440
then that mismatch that can exist like

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.400
you know

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:37.620
I had a period in my life where I

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.360
thought it was okay to drink alcohol

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.360
every evening and I thought it was just

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:45.480
normal or I was I thought I could get

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.520
away with eating all kinds of junk Foods

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.460
many many uh times a week

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:54.659
and uh feel fine and it was only when I

01:12:54.659 --> 01:12:57.900
really started to examine those

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.300
I guess it's in a way it's a

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.000
justification system in in action or at

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.739
least an element of it

01:13:04.739 --> 01:13:07.080
when I started investigating and I gave

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.920
up alcohol entirely actually and I

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.400
stopped eating junk food and the big

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.699
changes that that occurred for me that

01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:19.980
um kind of I felt like I was becoming

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.380
more centered again as a human being I

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.659
felt more centered I felt way more way

01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:25.620
better

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.100
and I'm not in uh you know I'm not off

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:32.100
to believe that it's it's a poison or

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.560
it's a disease that I you know I need to

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.159
be kept away from no no I prefer not

01:13:38.159 --> 01:13:40.620
drinking I prefer not eating junk food

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.100
and you know it's enabled me to Center

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:45.360
myself

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.600
in a in a different way than I felt

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.900
before or maybe I've I'm truly getting

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.400
more centered

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.340
but I was I guess my point kind of was

01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:59.820
or is that I really wanted to talk to

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.460
the 25 year olds and have a conversation

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.140
about like you know what are some of

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.940
these misconceptions

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.340
uh and not not in a judgmental way but

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:10.800
more like you know hey how do you see

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.340
this like are you aware that that you

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:16.440
know staying up all night filling your

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.900
your body with adrenaline through the

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.760
expressive shooter games you play all

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.640
night uh everything that goes on there

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.920
you know do you realize there's a cause

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.440
and effect going on here and you know

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.480
like just this kind of cause and effect

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.340
stuff

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.659
um

01:14:33.659 --> 01:14:35.400
and then you step back and you think

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.159
there's these big industries that play

01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:42.000
that that uh that you know inject their

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.360
their justifications into society and

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.340
people just swallow it

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.699
and there is there is you know an

01:14:50.699 --> 01:14:52.020
um especially with the internet and

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.280
everything

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.360
it's just there's all these sub-optimal

01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:58.739
um

01:14:58.739 --> 01:15:02.400
Justified ways of being that don't serve

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.960
at all

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.719
and they're just being maintained and

01:15:06.719 --> 01:15:08.940
it's all interrelated I'm gonna stop

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:11.400
talking first wait talking way too much

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.719
but like

01:15:12.719 --> 01:15:14.880
it's just to me it feels like it's all

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.760
interrelated but and I I see the

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:21.420
components but it's also quite blurred

01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.840
it's bloody fascinating but

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.900
I think you know is it that we can just

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.239
do best for ourselves

01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:33.300
is that where the focus should be or or

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.980
is it something that we as a collective

01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.000
need to kind of try and influence others

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.739
or is this what we should be creating

01:15:40.739 --> 01:15:42.900
YouTube channels for

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.580
you know and I loved your expression

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.320
last time about the cow introducing

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.140
bringing the cows back to the grass uh

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.880
or yeah I'm butchering it a little bit

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.820
but like I think the ambition

01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:57.000
sorry I'm going to shut up but like yeah

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.940
stuff that goes on in the head

01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:04.520
yeah so it's really sad because

01:16:04.679 --> 01:16:06.300
I first started YouTube

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:08.820
right it was kind of cool you could look

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:11.219
up this I I remember learning about

01:16:11.219 --> 01:16:13.739
ducks on YouTube and learning about all

01:16:13.739 --> 01:16:15.540
kinds of weird things people would put

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:20.940
on YouTube and it was a comment and now

01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:23.159
everything has got ads everything is

01:16:23.159 --> 01:16:27.659
monetized like like in the short period

01:16:27.659 --> 01:16:29.960
of time it

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.840
YouTubers and what YouTube used to be

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.910
um it's actually

01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:36.300
[Music]

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.300
um

01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:45.120
there's some if you there it take it's a

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.699
real struggle to make it worthwhile now

01:16:47.699 --> 01:16:51.320
whereas before it was simpler and more

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.500
uh friendly and worthwhile now you can

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.719
find more heavily produced cool things

01:16:57.719 --> 01:17:00.719
but there's so much noise and there's so

01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:02.580
much advertising and I think they even

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.739
put ads on on the pop-up school things

01:17:04.739 --> 01:17:06.719
or something I mean like it's like I

01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:09.360
don't get monetized I don't didn't ask

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.460
for that

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.300
um

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.460
and

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.580
um

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.980
and the and

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:23.460
it's kind of like these incentives are

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:26.100
sucking the life world out of children

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.020
really

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.020
um

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.420
you know it's it's not as little as the

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.159
Matrix where there are actual bodies

01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:40.320
laying down and then electrodes in their

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.540
heads but it's not really any different

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.420
because you're using

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:50.040
the the the the Ambient Energy the cha a

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.440
young person has and it's psychological

01:17:54.440 --> 01:18:00.960
needs uh make it ideal to uh be for the

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.659
system to parasitize

01:18:03.659 --> 01:18:05.880
um and that's actually more of the

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.880
literal truth of it than

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.640
any other kind of justification you can

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.320
have

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.900
um

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:18.900
so uh

01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:31.260
it's got to be heartbreaking to you know

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.860
like in Japan they have a real

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.679
disease where like I don't know 40 of

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:40.320
men between the ages of 20 and 40 never

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.600
come out of their their room they just

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.159
play video games

01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:49.080
and their parents take care of them like

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.360
yeah there's something

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:55.400
very sad about that Charlie

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.840
you know and

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.679
so much of this fascinating and I'm also

01:19:04.679 --> 01:19:07.980
you know trying to figure out

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.580
where my own I think that

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.320
you know the the little bit that I've

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:16.380
been here with you all I'm

01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.960
getting a lot of value out but I also

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.719
realize that

01:19:21.719 --> 01:19:24.000
the reason that I have so much further

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.920
to go

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.120
you know relates to

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.860
dysfunction in various parts of these

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.000
areas with respect to

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.880
not having been embodied my entire life

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.199
and

01:19:40.199 --> 01:19:42.960
and the way that that played out was

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.380
that

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.900
at a certain point sometime I think in

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.880
my early 30s

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.060
I deliberately made the choice that I

01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.560
was going to try to

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.679
engage as much as I could in technology

01:19:58.679 --> 01:20:00.179
and

01:20:00.179 --> 01:20:02.159
I found that that really worked for me

01:20:02.159 --> 01:20:04.920
because you don't have to be embodied to

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.199
understand

01:20:06.199 --> 01:20:09.300
when there's a binary right and it's

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.000
either yes or it's no and

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.920
that really worked in my favor because I

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:19.080
didn't have the capacity to handle

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.520
complexity

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.080
but yet

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:26.040
I could sort of make my way through from

01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:28.140
the bottom up in understanding

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.480
technology and

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.960
there was a point I was actually working

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.120
more than 20 years ago at a company that

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.480
was back then trying to do Ai and

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.880
sometime in the afternoon everybody in

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.560
the office most of whom were younger

01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.380
than me they were all in their early 20s

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:49.040
they would all start to play video games

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:52.980
and I had an experience with golf early

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.840
in my life where I realized that like

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.000
it's one of those things where the the

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.280
learning curve at the bottom is too long

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.980
I wasn't interested in devoting the

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.960
effort to get good at golf because

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.640
what's the payoff then you can hit a

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.199
ball into a hole

01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:09.960
um and and I saw the same thing about

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.900
video games that is in order to compete

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.580
with everybody else you actually had to

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:16.800
spend all this time and so I

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:19.440
deliberately didn't and in my head I was

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.840
literally saying

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.000
trying to figure out how the computer

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.600
works is a much better game for me to

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.580
play and so I did and it's worked out in

01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:37.500
the long run and and so hearing

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.420
and again you're not the only people to

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:42.840
be sort of fear-mongering about where

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.020
we're going with the future and AI

01:21:46.020 --> 01:21:47.820
it's just I have a very different

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:50.340
perspective

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.120
and

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:58.320
you know I guess my hope is that as you

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:01.800
were saying that humans will get more

01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.540
machine-like

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:08.340
there are a subset of AI researchers who

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.739
are trying to make machines more

01:22:10.739 --> 01:22:13.800
human-like right and to introduce Nuance

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.920
into the software in the right ways but

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.080
I also understand the dysfunction that

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.480
you witnessed at the bank and in fact

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.260
you know technology is my day job I just

01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:27.659
was you know a guy who was my professor

01:22:27.659 --> 01:22:30.600
40 years ago who can't figure out how to

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.480
log into his Gmail account and you know

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:36.900
it's it there's nothing to do about it

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.860
except try to be patient and help but

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.860
it's I don't know if I have much of a

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:45.659
point but

01:22:45.659 --> 01:22:47.580
like Eric I feel like I've talked too

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:50.100
much no like okay

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:54.719
so we're not actually that

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:57.560
uh

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.980
so like here's a question why is the bot

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:06.300
it you the body is attracted to AI this

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.060
is this is the truth our bodies are

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.280
attracted to AI

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.080
um

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.480
um I'm actually building something

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.739
called the cognoscope which is an AI

01:23:19.739 --> 01:23:23.400
thing it's built obviously on a chat

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:27.659
jpt4 but were my team is revising it to

01:23:27.659 --> 01:23:29.940
build it on something called action

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.620
logic so

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:34.560
I think that

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.739
um

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.040
you know everything is very non-linear

01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.500
and

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.320
um I'm just saying that this is this is

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.719
what we're going through you can have

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:51.540
many many people that are doctors you

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.159
know years ago you could be a doctor you

01:23:53.159 --> 01:23:56.300
get a career you lived in the town you

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:00.300
grew up with the children and you raised

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:04.679
babies and you put their people to their

01:24:04.679 --> 01:24:07.940
last days and you became a wise person

01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:10.980
and today to have a career as a doctor

01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:15.060
is not very well suited to become wise

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.940
if you're just doing AI so these things

01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:21.000
are real but on the other hand

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:21.780
um

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.480
why is the human body attracted to AI

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:27.360
what is it I I was saying to someone the

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.340
other day yesterday

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:31.440
oh people are going to love this this

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.719
cognoscope we're building and I kept on

01:24:33.719 --> 01:24:36.420
saying moth to a flame moth now was that

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:38.400
you guys I was saying like I'm off to a

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.440
flame oh no I was talking about bad boy

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.900
syndrome but there's something about Ai

01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:44.699
and people it's like moth to a flame

01:24:44.699 --> 01:24:47.400
moth to a flame moth to a flame

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.260
and so on the one hand we need to be

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:56.280
aware of the dysfunction that it brings

01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:59.159
um and on the other hand understand

01:24:59.159 --> 01:25:01.980
there's something about AI That's like

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:06.780
moth to a flame and this is an

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.120
interesting question like if you zoom

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:11.880
out uh it's an interesting question

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.980
what's on the other side of this I don't

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:17.100
know but what I do know is that the

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.500
price the humanity is going to pay is

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.500
for many generations of Lost Children

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.260
let's say identity formation on

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:28.140
computers is horrible

01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:33.179
um and this is this is a very large

01:25:33.179 --> 01:25:36.659
price and yet it's not a project you're

01:25:36.659 --> 01:25:38.760
going to stop

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.340
um so

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:45.420
I'm not like we're not exactly on

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.120
the same page in terms of the journey to

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.699
get here both of us here in this time

01:25:50.699 --> 01:25:53.580
space capsule on the internet

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:54.360
um

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:58.580
but the the question

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:01.920
is not that different really do you know

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:06.260
what I'm saying so so

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.440
the last thing you want is a bunch of

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:12.540
embodied people that don't know anything

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:17.280
about AI you know I uh we what we want

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.520
is a network of people who can

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.219
can

01:26:23.219 --> 01:26:27.540
agree on on what's happening in sort of

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.520
a kind of

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.280
this is what is actually happening right

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.300
and without a doubt uh it's it's

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.820
costing many generations of older people

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.520
a lot of confusion it's very sad it's

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.739
costing a lot of young especially men

01:26:43.739 --> 01:26:46.260
well women too on Tick Tock it's costing

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.360
them a lot in terms of certain

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.820
Generations because of identity

01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.580
formation is really

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.840
screwy on social media but

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.960
um

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.040
yeah I guess the the one thing that it

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.980
feels like it may be helpful to add is

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:11.940
that

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.820
all of the successes that we have right

01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:18.060
now and there are many with AI are

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:22.260
narrow AI where you're in the single

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:26.239
domain and doing incredible things and

01:27:26.239 --> 01:27:29.219
again the guy that I was working for

01:27:29.219 --> 01:27:31.199
more than 20 years ago who's still in

01:27:31.199 --> 01:27:33.120
the game and right there you know

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:34.980
pushing forward sort of on his own

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.659
because he doesn't work for Google or

01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:39.120
Microsoft or whatever

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.239
um you know is you know the goal is

01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:44.580
artificial general intelligence right to

01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.500
try to come up and in fact embodiment is

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.420
maybe the key right how do you figure

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.480
out how to

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:58.860
get the software to have some feeling of

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:01.199
being embodied because

01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:03.840
if that can happen then maybe there's

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.420
some way you can simulate affect any

01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.280
help

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:11.100
yeah it'll be interesting to have this

01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:14.639
conversation after I finish my agent

01:28:14.639 --> 01:28:18.360
the action you know the agent first one

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.460
was what agent in the machine and then

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.080
the next one is going to be the agent in

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:24.120
the world and

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.800
um but uh

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.060
it's an interesting question and there's

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.920
a lot of like

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.840
like

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.840
um

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.460
there's there's a lot of

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.739
people

01:28:40.739 --> 01:28:43.080
um asking questions at this level you

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.000
know on both sides of the

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.600
the sis the coin so

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:51.060
um yeah

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:53.520
it'll be interesting

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.219
um but it certainly has momentum of its

01:28:56.219 --> 01:29:00.060
own and it's not like you can get ahead

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:03.300
of it and turn the clock back or

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:05.159
something

01:29:05.159 --> 01:29:08.460
it's the era we live in they are you

01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:11.060
grew up in

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.239
Adriana

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.380
um yes I was just I might change a

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:24.600
little bit I was I raised my hand for

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.199
some reason and then that fast so I'll

01:29:28.199 --> 01:29:30.300
just I'll just try to make it alive

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.280
again I am

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.020
I think there was one in one of the

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.780
videos that um I watched of this recap

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:39.420
which has been really uh useful for me

01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:41.219
because I haven't participated for so

01:29:41.219 --> 01:29:43.139
long so it was kind of like a

01:29:43.139 --> 01:29:46.139
appreciated David your summary your

01:29:46.139 --> 01:29:48.840
encapsulators I appreciated everybody's

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:51.659
input because for somebody that hasn't

01:29:51.659 --> 01:29:55.500
participated live for so long

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.940
um

01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:59.219
um I was just remembering the

01:29:59.219 --> 01:30:02.340
applications in other people's worlds

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:05.699
and having bunny Riff on that and

01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:07.440
um so I just wanted to offer a few

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.020
things that arose for me I mean through

01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.699
the conversation it feels like one long

01:30:11.699 --> 01:30:13.980
conversation for me which all the Recaps

01:30:13.980 --> 01:30:16.440
that I listened and now this one that

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:18.060
I'm participating in

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:20.699
and I think that one of the things that

01:30:20.699 --> 01:30:23.880
was interesting for me to watch as

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.920
opposed to participate which I hadn't

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.159
thought of is that I have to be with the

01:30:29.159 --> 01:30:32.340
trouble in in regards to my effect every

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.980
time I have an arousal or not a fact I

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.159
have an arousal I can't act on it and

01:30:38.159 --> 01:30:41.760
because I know people here a little bit

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.560
because I have been in the sessions it's

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.540
it's kind of interesting for me because

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.280
my mind plays games that I am in the

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.679
session but I'm not so

01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:53.159
um even now the screen switched to a

01:30:53.159 --> 01:30:55.020
recording of the last session so I

01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:56.520
didn't know which one I was in I was

01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.260
like oh oh this is the recording and

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.120
this is the one I am

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.500
and

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:05.219
so the the way that I have to be with

01:31:05.219 --> 01:31:08.239
the arouser without participating

01:31:08.239 --> 01:31:11.460
percolates in me in a way that thoughts

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:13.860
that are generated wouldn't have been

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:16.080
generated if I was here because I'm

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.300
shaping like I'm helping shape this

01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.920
field so my mind is an actor here

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.540
whereas all these six months or whatever

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:27.120
that I haven't been an actor

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:30.540
I haven't been able to inject my

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.800
patterns

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.540
and therefore that has been really

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:36.600
really useful for me because uh it just

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.679
has undone other things like I I have um

01:31:40.679 --> 01:31:42.679
and I had to sit with other people's

01:31:42.679 --> 01:31:45.480
minds how it landed for David and Justin

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:49.440
and Eric and and then I was like ah I

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.540
would never have produced these thoughts

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:54.060
but if I let them sit with me for long

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:55.040
enough

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:58.800
then some creativity is generated so

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:02.219
that was a very useful recognition so

01:32:02.219 --> 01:32:02.820
um

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:05.100
that's one thing that I was like uh I

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:07.020
didn't feel like I was missing as not

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:08.580
being part of that I thought I was

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.440
gaining a different way of acting with

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:12.239
you know um

01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:15.239
and and then somebody else said about I

01:32:15.239 --> 01:32:16.920
think there were people sharing about

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.440
the embodiment piece that the course has

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.659
given them or how like being really

01:32:21.659 --> 01:32:25.260
alive and what what has been true for me

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.960
in my experience is less that nobody

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.179
doesn't give me but I think because I

01:32:30.179 --> 01:32:33.960
came from uh having other teachers that

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:37.260
have primarily focused on that well this

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.300
course has given me is the bridge with

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:41.639
the mind which I find really really

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:43.800
useful like I can't even explain how

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.719
useful it is because it's like having a

01:32:45.719 --> 01:32:47.639
shared justification

01:32:47.639 --> 01:32:50.639
because the other features that I have

01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.800
been with which I love and they're so

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:56.719
helpful they have really helped

01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:59.820
resensitize my body so that's to to

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.560
Charlie's

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.260
point I was also numb and I mean if you

01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:06.600
do research I work a lot with a female

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.920
body and and and and and and and and

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:13.100
there's so many things that the female

01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:15.900
reproductive system uh you know if you

01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.300
put a pill on that for many years that

01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.100
shapes the whole minds of generations

01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:22.199
and that's okay I'm not even saying that

01:33:22.199 --> 01:33:24.120
but I'm I'm just saying that there's so

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.639
much that we don't do we don't know what

01:33:26.639 --> 01:33:28.800
goes on we don't understand the female

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.260
physiology as opposed to the male and

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:34.080
and the FX stream and how it lands but

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.699
so I'm I'm saying all that because

01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:40.739
through listening to the new ones and

01:33:40.739 --> 01:33:42.719
the fine-graining

01:33:42.719 --> 01:33:44.340
of

01:33:44.340 --> 01:33:45.300
um that's

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.179
being given by you Bonnie and then

01:33:48.179 --> 01:33:50.580
grappled with by by the pop-up school

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.340
and then hashed out

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:56.219
it's given me so much more touch points

01:33:56.219 --> 01:33:58.620
how to Shared reality with people

01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.679
because I'm I'm noticing that what my

01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:03.840
work so that has helped a lot in my work

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.040
because in my work I work a lot with

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.219
uh reconnecting maybe even describe my

01:34:11.219 --> 01:34:13.800
work as trying to create a justification

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:16.800
system that's more supportive to the

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.000
female physiology so so if you do have

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.080
dispositional states that change

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.300
throughout the month every day

01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.280
that in that is true I mean it's true

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.080
for everybody but in the female body

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.960
that is really true in the cocktail of

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.480
hormones so then the interface with

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.960
reality uh and progress the way the

01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:39.659
progress is gonna show up or the uh how

01:34:39.659 --> 01:34:44.179
body calls the Cosmopolitan cells

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:46.639
interfaces with that

01:34:46.639 --> 01:34:49.199
produces a certain justification that I

01:34:49.199 --> 01:34:51.360
see in the women that I work with which

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.000
is not helpful at all it just Loops in

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.060
itself and it's not creative so then I

01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.340
now I can have much more language what

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:00.960
what this course has given me is that

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.239
when I say to women dispositional State

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:05.699
and I and we can create our own language

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:08.100
but they understand they're not

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:11.300
emotional they go like oh my

01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:14.100
dispositional my state shift every day

01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:16.860
it's not that I'm erratic and then

01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:19.320
slowly they start having more touch

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.679
points to their experience and then we

01:35:22.679 --> 01:35:26.040
can communicate to the other physiology

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:29.639
which might be a man or a trans man or a

01:35:29.639 --> 01:35:31.739
trans woman so all these different touch

01:35:31.739 --> 01:35:34.320
points with more language and then we

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320
can go like okay how do we cross over

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.060
and then I notice that there is less

01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.060
tension in the field because we're

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.159
actually actively trying we're not

01:35:44.159 --> 01:35:46.199
assuming we're the same

01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:48.179
we're not we're not we don't have this

01:35:48.179 --> 01:35:49.980
shared

01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:52.260
um justification it's like oh we're all

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.699
the same it's like no we're actually

01:35:53.699 --> 01:35:56.880
let's course correct that assumption

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.060
that starting point and then

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.400
and then from there we can we can go

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.440
back to saying that we're almost the

01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:07.020
same but because we have come so far too

01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.480
not noticing that anyway so I'm just

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:12.000
saying that your course has given me not

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.860
only me but I

01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.139
noticed that the language piece with the

01:36:16.139 --> 01:36:18.659
body is just it helps the body actually

01:36:18.659 --> 01:36:22.679
truly because we're language people so

01:36:22.679 --> 01:36:25.020
yeah

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:27.540
yeah that's beautiful and and then

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.120
notice that the dispositional so it's

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:33.000
like everything is an inversion so the a

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000
normal I love that first of all that

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.540
Insight you had that taking the pill for

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:43.020
a woman is like a man being on a video

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.480
saying it interrupts something extremely

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.280
natural

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:51.360
um and yet the the the cycle

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.960
the physiology is never

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.340
extermined exterminated so it just

01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:58.620
confuses everything but yeah to

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:03.179
understand the the female cycle as a a

01:37:03.179 --> 01:37:05.880
rhythm of a dispositional state

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.639
and once you understand that you don't

01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:10.920
have to attach a narrative or an emotion

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:14.280
to it see because when I grew up like if

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.980
your dispositional state was like that

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.900
and that's not like the standard

01:37:18.900 --> 01:37:21.239
Cosmopolitan self then you have to go

01:37:21.239 --> 01:37:22.980
looking for a reason so maybe it's

01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:24.719
because you yelled at me or because of

01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:27.320
this or because of that versus

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.020
the inversion which is this is I can

01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:34.080
watch you know the Gap exercise to be

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.940
aware of your dispositional states to be

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:38.880
surprised it's always moving

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:42.000
um and and

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.800
um and that it has a natural

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.100
intelligence to it and there's it's a

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.960
resource so

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:49.560
um

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:51.679
um

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.480
and that a lot of the frustration is

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.780
because there's a mismatch between that

01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:00.780
kind of time and Cosmopolitan time let's

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.460
say you know in the

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.739
even if you don't have a job you have to

01:38:04.739 --> 01:38:07.380
send your kids in this time stamps and

01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.120
there's this and there's that and

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.659
everything is

01:38:11.659 --> 01:38:14.699
that temporal order is artificial

01:38:14.699 --> 01:38:17.460
relative to

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:21.120
the steeper temporal order so

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.620
um

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.840
and you don't have to justify the fact

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.420
that the mismatch is there you have to

01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.460
learn to

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:31.580
um

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.460
to work with it obviously

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:36.179
um

01:38:36.179 --> 01:38:39.780
but you don't have to justify why the

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:43.880
mismatch is there the mismatch is there

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.000
foreign

01:39:02.719 --> 01:39:05.760
stops being internalized as

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.719
um

01:39:06.719 --> 01:39:10.620
a pathology like oh I you know I oh I'm

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.179
always like that I'm like well you're

01:39:12.179 --> 01:39:13.860
experiencing you're a dispositional

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:16.320
state actually wasn't supposed to be one

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:19.260
right and and it has very different

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:22.139
flavors to it it's not noticing and and

01:39:22.139 --> 01:39:24.780
then they go like oh someone so the

01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:27.360
frame of just I'm not crazy can release

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.760
so much energy from the system just

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.620
because of this mismatch for the

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.920
Cosmopolitan yeah it's probably similar

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:37.260
to why children have so much problem

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.860
going through puberty now same reason

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:43.860
that they don't they don't expect to

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:46.620
have their bodies feel like that and and

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:50.580
and they don't expect to have it be such

01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:53.940
a mismatch with external reality that

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.940
tells you

01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:59.159
no the girls that happen to be girlish

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:01.620
and boys I had to do boyish that's what

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.780
externally and if that's not the case

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.480
then you must not be one of those

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:10.080
yes exactly it's a confusion it is a

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:14.400
confusion it is a confusion yeah

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.060
hmm

01:40:21.719 --> 01:40:24.480
I have something to say about

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.239
um the AI discussion

01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:33.780
that we become more machine like

01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:37.139
and lose subjectivity and then the flip

01:40:37.139 --> 01:40:39.360
side of the coin of making the machine

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.420
or human-like

01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:45.860
is either one of those good

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.719
yeah I mean okay

01:40:51.719 --> 01:40:55.139
my point is

01:40:55.139 --> 01:40:58.679
I'm still intrigued by

01:40:58.679 --> 01:40:59.840
that

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:03.360
exterraneous being that you were Bonnie

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:06.719
laughing with your mother having fallen

01:41:06.719 --> 01:41:08.940
on the floor

01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.940
and it seems to me like

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:16.219
what Eric was pointing at

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:20.040
there's so much complexity or we are a

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.380
justification systems based on our

01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.360
personal

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:29.280
pleasure or the collective about somehow

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:34.400
values in the collective domain

01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.880
aren't we headed toward

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:44.159
values we don't even know what the heck

01:41:44.159 --> 01:41:46.940
they are yet

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:49.860
not the justification for peace because

01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:53.659
of what Obama said but a justification

01:41:53.659 --> 01:41:57.659
for a value that we're no longer even

01:41:57.659 --> 01:42:02.000
sure what that value might be

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:08.460
are we open and you said it also Bonnie

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:10.500
you said we don't know what it's going

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.780
to look like Beyond

01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:15.920
the AI

01:42:18.780 --> 01:42:21.480
and I'm hoping

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.699
I have faith

01:42:23.699 --> 01:42:28.340
that we when we get into November

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:37.219
we spend we expend energy into

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:40.199
so what are our values now and what are

01:42:40.199 --> 01:42:42.360
our values we're going to bring into the

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:46.280
moral animal we're becoming

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.860
more like your horses

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.780
that they feel through the ground and

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.679
they communicate without words and they

01:43:03.679 --> 01:43:09.679
have a life that includes these humans

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:14.179
you know more something like that

01:43:22.199 --> 01:43:26.699
yeah so you know this is the interesting

01:43:26.699 --> 01:43:28.440
thing

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:31.860
that I I hear and what you're saying

01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:34.920
is we're saying that humans are becoming

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.380
more machine-like

01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:41.659
perhaps more than machines

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:46.920
and animals meet like horses they move

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:50.340
way over here into the human world

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:53.600
and in reality humans have very very

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.460
little Talent

01:43:56.460 --> 01:43:58.619
to learning the language of other

01:43:58.619 --> 01:43:59.940
species

01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:03.119
the the others the the other animals

01:44:03.119 --> 01:44:06.540
really understand us that pigeons

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.460
understand me more than I understand

01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:12.659
them and so this awareness of how

01:44:12.659 --> 01:44:16.500
ignorant we are uh and how limited we

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:20.639
are to our own language module models

01:44:20.639 --> 01:44:23.100
um and then of course AI is built around

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:27.060
our language models and

01:44:27.060 --> 01:44:29.040
um that

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.280
that there's something equal and

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:34.980
opposite in the animal world the animals

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:38.119
also move way into our world and

01:44:38.119 --> 01:44:41.340
we have very little capacity

01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:44.460
for empathic projection we called it to

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:47.400
move into the reality of the other

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.580
beings uh were actually very coarse

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:53.040
grained and so as we become more and

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:55.380
more machine like we move even further

01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:58.800
or further away from this whole language

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:01.760
and communication that's available

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:04.739
hugely available

01:45:04.739 --> 01:45:09.119
um on the other side is really

01:45:09.119 --> 01:45:11.119
um

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.659
maybe what bodies are starving for and

01:45:18.659 --> 01:45:21.239
that's why they're Like Moths To Flames

01:45:21.239 --> 01:45:24.900
with the AI because they're starting so

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:27.920
the junk food

01:45:28.199 --> 01:45:30.900
a quick fix or something but

01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:34.020
this is you know in in that

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:36.719
article I wrote is it tells

01:45:36.719 --> 01:45:39.540
and toward the end it talks about like

01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.699
the first time philosophers were freaked

01:45:41.699 --> 01:45:43.560
out about language was because they

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.380
taught the chimpanzees to sign

01:45:46.380 --> 01:45:48.480
did you read that one

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.900
oh so if you read the post is it toast

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:54.179
it talks about Ai and then it talks

01:45:54.179 --> 01:45:56.940
about Vicki Hearn who was a philosopher

01:45:56.940 --> 01:45:59.520
and a poet at Harvard and an animal

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.360
trainer and she talks so she died a long

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.420
time ago before AI but she she's talking

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:09.420
about like this hysteria that comes over

01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.000
the philosophy Department because they

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.639
had just taught the first two

01:46:14.639 --> 01:46:16.800
chimpanzees how to use American Sign

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.600
Language they raised him up as children

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.280
in human home and they could use

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:23.420
American Sign Language

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.739
and so because she has a credential

01:46:25.739 --> 01:46:27.840
she's a dog trainer and she's a

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:29.340
philosopher at Harvard

01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:32.940
she gets a invitation to come into the

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:36.840
home and meet these two chimpanzees and

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.719
uh there it's at breakfast and she says

01:46:39.719 --> 01:46:41.699
you know

01:46:41.699 --> 01:46:45.600
um the the chimpanzee says you know Coco

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.100
wants fruit Coco wants this in in

01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.800
to her it's obvious that communication

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:54.900
is happening but it's not clear if it's

01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.340
communication

01:46:56.340 --> 01:47:00.119
or if the chimpanzees have learned what

01:47:00.119 --> 01:47:01.920
they want and how to get it you know

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:04.560
language is very weird right

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.060
but then she goes on to say uh but the

01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.119
disturbing thing is that Coco and the

01:47:12.119 --> 01:47:14.639
other one they're in cages and when they

01:47:14.639 --> 01:47:16.679
go out for a walk going for a walk

01:47:16.679 --> 01:47:18.360
entails

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.920
uh

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.199
um

01:47:21.199 --> 01:47:24.840
collars and Cattle prods

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.360
because they can sign language but

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.880
they're not trustable because they will

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.500
kill you if they're not in the right

01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:34.139
mood and then says a dog trainer she

01:47:34.139 --> 01:47:36.420
says what I know about dogs is they

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:39.600
share a common vocabulary which means

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.960
they you can trust them and they trust

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.480
you and when trust is broken

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.540
take it you can build it back and she's

01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.400
like that's communication

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.260
not the ability to use the linguistic

01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.699
signifiers

01:47:56.699 --> 01:47:59.159
and so yeah I encourage you to read it

01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:01.320
it's called is it toast and

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.400
in the end it's like so when while we're

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.360
playing with AI uh and so she asked this

01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:11.719
question

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.860
um she talks about Camp David these are

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:16.679
old because she wrote in the 50s but she

01:48:16.679 --> 01:48:18.960
said like this is what the promise of

01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.719
Camp David is is that you could you

01:48:21.719 --> 01:48:25.800
could talk yourself through

01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.739
killing toward peace but we haven't been

01:48:28.739 --> 01:48:31.800
able actually to prove this yet and and

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.179
so in it ends up it says something like

01:48:35.179 --> 01:48:39.360
so as we're interfacing with AI some of

01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.600
us will be good dogs but most of us are

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:45.600
likely to be chimpanzees

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.480
the mistake that language is happening

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.179
but we're not not developing trust not

01:48:51.179 --> 01:48:53.159
developing character not developing

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:55.500
social relationships which he says is

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.600
what communication actually is is

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.580
establishing a vocabulary of these

01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.080
social skills

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.860
so AI cannot establish the vocabulary of

01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:06.360
social skills

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:09.540
and in that case it should be in a cage

01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:10.800
so

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.260
um that's the first in the series of the

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.940
articles on AI and the other ones are

01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:16.920
called Agent the agent in this and the

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.320
agent and that so

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:23.300
um but it's really cool because I I

01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:27.060
excerpt it how like it was really like a

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.860
big thing people were talking about like

01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:31.500
what is what are humans if language if

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:34.139
chimpanzees consign it was the same kind

01:49:34.139 --> 01:49:36.480
of problem space that people were

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.139
juggling with

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:44.820
I think I may have read it but I you

01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:46.380
know I can't remember everything yeah

01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:49.500
yeah and it's got a funny name so

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:50.219
um

01:49:50.219 --> 01:49:52.500
you know part of what I was

01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:54.659
aiming toward

01:49:54.659 --> 01:49:56.100
s

01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:00.600
what is the animal nature that we have

01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:05.400
as humans that allows us to

01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.179
um

01:50:06.179 --> 01:50:10.320
be drawn to being a Good Samaritan or

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.900
something like that or what are the

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:15.320
values that we might

01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:20.280
somehow come to in this day and age

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.040
with all that recognition that you

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:25.639
talked about

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:30.780
having been drawn to the machine

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:33.540
what are the values that are emerging

01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:36.060
now that will

01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:39.060
facilitate

01:50:40.139 --> 01:50:44.719
a more beautiful a more beautiful world

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.560
that's my life yeah so the morale animal

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.320
that there's no animal who could be a

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:55.260
Good Samaritan in Ivan Eric's terms

01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:57.540
because the Good Samaritan

01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:01.560
your animal nature is disgusted and yes

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:06.239
and yet you take care of it right so

01:51:06.239 --> 01:51:08.460
um so

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:11.340
this is the the question of the new

01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:13.980
human is is nature growing a new organ

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:16.500
which is the moral organ and it's not

01:51:16.500 --> 01:51:19.639
you know it's not yet

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:23.460
uh uh developed

01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:25.500
um because you're not going to go and

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:29.699
find those kinds of action Logics in the

01:51:29.699 --> 01:51:31.199
animal kingdom I mean you can find

01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:34.280
exceptions and some sweet stories but

01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:38.520
not intentionally so the Good Samaritan

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.980
would be

01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:42.659
that's why we said it doesn't work

01:51:42.659 --> 01:51:45.840
you're disgusted by the person you're

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.719
going to help and yet

01:51:48.719 --> 01:51:51.600
some other kind of valuation some kind

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:55.020
of instinct uh Zach Stone calls it a new

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:57.900
Instinct it's basically a new Instinct

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:02.280
in nature to help so

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.260
um and that you know we'll talk about

01:52:04.260 --> 01:52:06.360
that in that course I think you might be

01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:10.699
interested in but that's really

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:14.100
what was remarkable about what illich is

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:15.840
is saying and that he thought the church

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:19.139
destroyed because the church just

01:52:19.139 --> 01:52:19.880
um

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:24.119
corporatized and institutionalized care

01:52:24.119 --> 01:52:26.460
you know so we have hospitals and this

01:52:26.460 --> 01:52:30.719
and that but it gets it it allowed us to

01:52:30.719 --> 01:52:33.420
justify not caring for our neighbors

01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.900
because we give money to the taxes to

01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:39.179
have social welfare programs and stuff

01:52:39.179 --> 01:52:42.060
like that so it's it's really

01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:44.520
that is quite radical and when we talk

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.340
about the moral animal

01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:50.040
they will all will truly be out of our

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:53.520
animal nature or saying that that

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.400
Nature's basing on us

01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:00.000
uh betting on us as the organ of

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.260
the moral instinct

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:06.080
um

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:09.000
not that it's separate from nature right

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.020
it's we we realize we are this organ of

01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:15.119
Nature and just like when we talk about

01:53:15.119 --> 01:53:17.340
organs of nature

01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:20.460
um just like in our body when my insulin

01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.400
level is out of whack my all my cells

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:24.960
suffer

01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.239
but only my pancreas can do something

01:53:27.239 --> 01:53:28.560
about it

01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:29.820
so

01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:32.100
when the human

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:34.500
impact on the earth is out of whack

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:37.860
everybody suffers but only the moral

01:53:37.860 --> 01:53:41.400
animal the moral organ uh can do

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:42.840
something about it

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:47.840
and that's the metaphor we'll use

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.199
because you're not going to find it in

01:53:52.199 --> 01:53:56.300
the other aspects of nature

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:03.900
reminds me of this story of your duck

01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:06.179
oh yeah

01:54:06.179 --> 01:54:08.280
um although some they were picking on

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.199
them the other day and one of the boy

01:54:10.199 --> 01:54:13.139
docs who's quite big his name is pipe

01:54:13.139 --> 01:54:16.139
pipe Penny but it

01:54:16.139 --> 01:54:19.260
he's a boy he he beat on the one that

01:54:19.260 --> 01:54:21.900
was beating on the

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:22.820
the

01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.739
sick one and I thought oh that's kind of

01:54:25.739 --> 01:54:28.280
interesting

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:29.340
oh

01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.630
yeah

01:54:31.630 --> 01:54:33.179
[Music]

01:54:33.179 --> 01:54:35.400
and his and his broken foot is still

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.619
alive like I mean I'm not going to take

01:54:37.619 --> 01:54:40.500
it out of its Little cast but it it has

01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:42.719
tension and which is after three or four

01:54:42.719 --> 01:54:46.380
days mostly they die and it falls off so

01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.360
just a little bit of Hope there you can

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.860
get around

01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:53.280
but here's something funny I just want

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.380
to say I think you didn't misunderstand

01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:56.940
me but in case somebody's listening to

01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:59.040
this the reason why we laughed this

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.639
morning at my mom is because yesterday

01:55:02.639 --> 01:55:05.159
the objective situation is she was on

01:55:05.159 --> 01:55:08.040
the couch and she was just going help me

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:10.199
help me hey and she'd been cuckoo and

01:55:10.199 --> 01:55:13.139
and when I was the objective situation

01:55:13.139 --> 01:55:15.000
today was she was on the floor

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.100
underneath the table and I walked in and

01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.440
she's like hi and I'm like what are you

01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:21.300
doing down there you see the difference

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:24.500
was the whole attitude the whole

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:27.119
expression of what was that so

01:55:27.119 --> 01:55:29.040
objectively yeah you would think it

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.679
would be much sadder that she's laying

01:55:31.679 --> 01:55:34.199
underneath the table on the floor versus

01:55:34.199 --> 01:55:36.360
on the couch but that's not how it

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.520
that's not how it was that actually was

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:40.860
right so

01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:42.920
um

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.679
but

01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.239
um one thing that did happen two days

01:55:48.239 --> 01:55:51.420
ago with the duck that has a broken leg

01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:53.820
is he's in his own

01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:55.619
he's with the other Ducks now but

01:55:55.619 --> 01:55:57.119
there's like a little fence around it so

01:55:57.119 --> 01:56:00.300
they don't pick on him at night and

01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:03.540
um just before I I left the other day he

01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:04.860
had rolled

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:07.619
on his back and he couldn't get up

01:56:07.619 --> 01:56:11.280
and I had to help him up and so like

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:13.440
now that you mention it that was kind of

01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:15.780
like the same situation that it was my

01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:16.980
mom was in

01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.159
I mean life is just

01:56:20.159 --> 01:56:22.760
you know

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:29.639
it's like a box of chocolates that

01:56:29.639 --> 01:56:33.840
sometimes they melt all over there

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.639
yeah

01:56:35.639 --> 01:56:38.179
but

01:56:38.219 --> 01:56:41.119
all is well

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.100
you know you can't ask for more so you

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:46.260
you know

01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:48.119
it's good for now the duck is good for

01:56:48.119 --> 01:56:50.340
now and tomorrow's another day we don't

01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:53.119
we don't know

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:57.300
Bonnie thanks for taking my nudge into

01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.639
the future of the pop-up School in the

01:56:59.639 --> 01:57:03.300
next few months yeah

01:57:11.599 --> 01:57:14.699
the moral animal is I think there's one

01:57:14.699 --> 01:57:16.860
other after that but it kind of like

01:57:16.860 --> 01:57:19.199
builds up to the moral animal and then

01:57:19.199 --> 01:57:21.300
it has something I think that's a little

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.500
more conceptual individuation and Beyond

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:28.440
human or the new you yeah the new human

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.360
so the new humans will build on the

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:33.480
moral animal yeah

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:36.780
but the moral animals like

01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:39.239
the Pinnacle of the whole year and then

01:57:39.239 --> 01:57:42.800
then yeah

01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:48.780
okay my friends thank you so much it's

01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:52.380
been a great first semester

01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:57.260
summer break use it wisely
