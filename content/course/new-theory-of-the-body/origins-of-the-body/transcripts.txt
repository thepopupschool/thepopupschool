## Cohort 1

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.279
how is it that we are here

question

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.639
okay welcome everyone I think we should

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.619
spend a certain amount of time uh just

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.619
socializing after our summer break I see

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.519
Ray is probably in Italy

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.859
um is that correct

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.740
yes so that's cool

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.320
uh

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.860
and Marie has been abandoned to the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.780
property here in Connecticut so I know

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.399
she's on her way

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.219
uh so that's their update

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.739
um yeah so um if you want to just check

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.420
in with an update

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.800
um maybe we'll have some late skis

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.120
that's that would be great

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.100
so great to be back

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.119
[Laughter]

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.659
seriously it really is I I it sort of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.119
caught me by surprise you know September

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.320
and oh my God it starts today you know

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.860
um

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.720
so

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.060
I just want to say

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.500
that the arousal and the dispositional

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920
state

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.159
has a surplus excess uncapturable and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.400
unknowable and unmeasurable

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.500
hahaha

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.520
that's directed to all of you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.939
not just Bonita although she is the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.040
principal

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.000
subversive instigator

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.659
thank you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.520
gosh I feel like the golden retriever

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.760
with the muddy pods

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360
[Laughter]

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.620
I've been spending time reading

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.720
investigations of a dog

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.420
you know I'm really into this canonical

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.420
[Laughter]

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.120
investigation so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.519
and also I think I'm joining your tools

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.500
of conviviality I'm pretty excited about

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.239
that oh cool well since you you are

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.700
coming to Europe you know in this thing

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.860
I feel like I should be on this side to

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.739
welcome you you know yeah

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.239
hopefully it'll be audacious there's

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.400
some cool there's some oh I know I

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.840
wanted to start this but go ahead and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.260
keep checking in I I almost forgot

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.700
the key thing

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.500
I'm also really excited to be back I

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.220
found myself really missing the classes

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.800
um in August uh because I had a lot more

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.280
time now classes just started up

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.260
and but I'm really I'm still really

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.120
excited but

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.780
um

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.480
yeah and I wanted to also say that I had

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.760
the opportunity to to live in the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.540
Redwoods um this summer and I lived with

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.599
donkeys right in my front yard and

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.640
chickens in my backyard

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.099
and I thought of you a lot Bonnie and um

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.519
and I absolutely

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.739
loved waking up to the donkey calls

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.200
every morning it just I recorded them

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.599
and I still listened to them on my phone

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.080
all the time and every time I hear them

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.739
I don't know it brings a very particular

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.400
connection and joy like I I laugh I it's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.040
like uncontrollable like it just bubbles

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.360
up

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.919
um and that because that was my first

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.859
experience of of living like that and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.340
then also having the trees I mean it was

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.680
just it was just really really

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.500
incredible and I you know just really

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.380
grateful for that experience

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.540
I just wanted to share that

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.960
yeah

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.139
you know you can keep that in mind when

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.500
we do the practice today because

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.400
um

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.919
when we asked this question you know how

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.199
are we here or

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.960
um what is the template

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.060
we often ask it from our human

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.780
perspective right and so what comes from

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.800
uh what comes into our minds is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.500
like The Moody Blues song you know that

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.419
all this stuff we're doing on the planet

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.699
and stuff but you know how did the trees

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.580
get here and how come the donkeys

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.919
because it's so easy for the donkeys to

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.160
be happy uh

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.000
you know so one of the things we want to

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.600
do in this practice is is

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.780
use the context that's arising for us

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.440
for us it's interesting

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.500
um

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.840
yeah because you can really you feel

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.820
that you feel that relationship and

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.259
that's that's an interesting

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.479
relationship to contemplate when we're

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.680
constant when we're going to go and

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.320
contemplate this question

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.320
um

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.759
we're just doing a check-in if to see

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.860
you know maybe till the quarter after uh

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.539
to see what you've been up to this

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.780
summer

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.440
um

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.120
and if there's any

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.800
I already checked in for Marie and Ray

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.720
no no you guys should check in how it

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.419
talk to us about Italy

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.800
and Italy not

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.380
um

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.080
I realized being here I have absolutely

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.319
no equanimity

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.500
I can't contain myself I don't even know

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.600
what I look like walking around the

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.639
streets but

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.080
um

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.020
I don't know why I'm so happy here

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.900
but there's a tremendous happiness and

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.060
it's just awesome just step into it

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.680
every day

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.539
yeah

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.140
yeah it's it's

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.400
[Music]

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.400
um

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.460
it feels huge and

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.160
the time that you can see here is very

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.139
different than the kind of time

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.419
that's at home or that's available at

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:25.560
home

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.900
the kind of human time that's present

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.479
here just even in the walls and on the

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:32.840
streets

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.680
um so that's that's awesome

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.599
and the food I mean you know people talk

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:41.220
about the difference the food is so

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.440
incredibly different here it's so

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.580
different

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.580
uh just attack not just a taste but the

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.520
textures and the intention behind it is

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.580
just wonderful so anyway

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.919
um that's that and Marie is coming on

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.960
Tuesday

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.240
so we get to share this

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.740
hi everybody

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.199
Miss missed you all too

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.199
yeah

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.660
so yeah I'm coming on Tuesday

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.020
um it's great to be back

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.860
um

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.620
and it feels like

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.639
um

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:30.240
like the pop-up school has been it

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.000
hasn't gone anywhere it's it's always

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.440
sort of there and a presence

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.200
um so

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.560
um and having live virtual bodies versus

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.060
just

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.959
um

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.480
yeah the other ways that the pop-up

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.480
School stays present is is a good thing

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.940
I think

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.660
um

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.480
one thing I'll I'll share that stands

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.459
out to me

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:03.060
um

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.140
something I did over my summer was

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.959
um traveled to a place I'd never been

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:13.320
before which was

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.300
um I've been to a lot of troubled places

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.580
in our world

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.040
um but this one kind of

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.320
um got me like

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.440
it kind of took me for a ride

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.899
um so I was

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:29.459
um I spent

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:34.080
twice I traveled to Iraq for two weeks

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.420
at a time

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.260
and

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.959
um and I think the thing that I want to

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:43.019
share about the trip was because I'm

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:48.080
just writing up the report from it and

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.380
um

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.959
so evaluating a project that is working

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.360
on social cohesion in the north of Iraq

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.060
where there's just a

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.740
um

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.040
people have been through just

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.500
unbelievable suffering and so hanging

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.839
out with the transcripts it reminds me

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:12.300
of

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.100
um

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.279
I love this story you told at one point

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.220
Bonnie about like your your duck that

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.860
got like beat up in the night and then

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.959
he showed up in the pond

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.240
happy

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.580
and I feel like that's what I've gotten

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.839
to hang out and witnesses that within

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:34.980
um

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.000
uh kind of that human capacity to just

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.580
kind of Shake It Off

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.339
and come back and

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:47.459
um the way in which you know despite how

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:48.660
much can

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.839
have been broken

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:55.260
um just to kind of step back into a

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.720
sense of happiness to be alive

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.019
so

00:11:04.019 --> 00:11:05.459
um

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:08.100
that's that's about all I've got except

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.220
I I will

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.579
um I will reveal that I have two pop-up

00:11:14.579 --> 00:11:17.579
School uh friends

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:20.459
that are kind of I don't know where they

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:23.220
are but they might show up any any

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.040
moment so

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.579
um so they're there but you lost them is

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:32.959
what you're saying yeah

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.060
I don't know I don't know where they're

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.760
hiding but they're um they should be

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.980
here somewhere

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.899
um yeah so

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:46.459
um Holly and Kevin are here

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.279
somewhere

00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:59.820
I'll just say that I got to read part of

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.459
Marie's report

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:05.880
and if I can reveal Marie

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.180
the word the phrase you used

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:14.720
she managed to sneak in Social imaginary

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.019
which I thought was completely brilliant

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:21.420
and apropos

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.120
and I've missed everyone I feel like

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.700
that kid who gets new pencils and a

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.640
backpack and a notebook and I'm back to

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.899
school and it's my happy place so glad

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:36.440
to be back

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.820
okay feels good to be back

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.380
um

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.200
probably the highlight of the summer

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.620
um we got to visit BC in Vancouver

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.019
specifically and

00:12:58.019 --> 00:12:58.860
um

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.740
jolt had been there once before for a

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.880
quick trip but it was my first time and

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.380
we've been kind of going back and forth

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.480
about like where to live we live in

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.060
Mexico now like do we stay

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.860
here where there's like a lot of

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.600
vibrancy and I've been here and like

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.360
know the culture but like kind of like

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.220
had a bit of a longing for like

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.079
somewhere more similar to where I grew

00:13:22.079 --> 00:13:22.800
up

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.139
but where do we go and like know where

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:27.240
it was just feeling right

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.720
um and we had no intention of uh

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.279
like even thinking about moving there

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:34.200
but we like both of our shoulders just

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.500
kind of dropped when we were there

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.500
um I think some combination of like

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.639
the natural environment and just how

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:46.440
like friend like a combination of

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.360
friendly and interesting we found the

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.600
average stranger to be

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.000
um in a way that didn't feel like I

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.420
don't know there's

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.160
not to down but

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.420
um kind of like East Coast Canada

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.680
there's kind of like a pervasive

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.300
politeness

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.380
um but there it just felt like a

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.079
pervasive like happiness and

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.600
friendliness to be in nature

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.320
um

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.639
yeah and there were just like so many

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:13.320
sites and like the mountains and the

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.019
ocean like combined with like a really

00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:19.380
diverse and dynamic city uh so yeah we

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.300
decided that we'll make that home in

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.339
like a year or so and that's that's

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:24.720
really exciting that was really great

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.040
yeah yeah it was a really great trip

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.480
development yeah yeah really cost of

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.959
living be damned this is just for us so

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:38.300
yeah that was a development

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.040
I'll share before we start I love

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.279
donkeys

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:48.899
Susan I'm glad you got to be with

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:51.360
donkeys I lived on a farm in Mississippi

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.339
for two years and there was a donkey

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:55.680
like in the field next door

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.880
it was

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.899
um

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:00.959
yeah uh so

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:05.399
I've been contemplating gravity

00:15:05.399 --> 00:15:08.060
and

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.680
um well just yesterday I was

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.660
contemplating gravity and

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.760
like that it's not really a thing right

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.740
I mean it's

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.839
like we don't really know why I'm

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.120
bringing this up it it just came up

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.120
funny when you first said

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.760
how is it that we're all here

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.740
you know it's like we don't really know

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.860
why gravity

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.660
does what it does it's kind of like when

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.220
you were talking about electricity and

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.380
little animism video that I did with you

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.560
it's like that's just what we call it

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.120
and

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.639
you know I don't for me more and more

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:49.699
coming back to just the the simple

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:53.279
Miracle of being here

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:54.600
is

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.779
is enough so I'm appreciating being in

00:15:57.779 --> 00:16:01.100
the miracle with you all right now

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.950
yeah so maybe I'll start from there

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.139
[Music]

00:16:04.139 --> 00:16:06.060
um

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.500
gravity

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.480
for example and I've said this before

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.199
but

00:16:12.959 --> 00:16:15.000
we think of you know

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.320
we see a lake and we say well the water

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.060
stays in the lake because it's like a

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.339
bowl and the water is in the bowl

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:25.920
and then we see the ocean which is even

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.199
weirder because it wraps around the

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:29.760
Earth but

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.160
in general we still think you know

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.440
there's depths in there and it's deep

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.199
and there's trenches and it and it sinks

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:39.540
in there because it's like water in a

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.519
bowl but then when we look at the Earth

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:44.519
and you see the ocean

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:46.980
in space

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.120
it's not really in a bowl it's just kind

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.300
of

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.820
grabbing onto the Earth

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.279
uh

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:04.020
and um the reason why I I'm gonna build

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.540
the course today on this what you say is

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.640
because

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.459
that what I just said is so much closer

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:13.260
to the truth it's not just the other

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.179
side of my perspective it's actually

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:19.740
more real than thinking that water's in

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.380
a bowl because the bowl is holding it

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.299
right

00:17:24.299 --> 00:17:26.640
um and

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.140
um

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.960
um why are we

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.260
starting with this thing with Origins

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.260
um there's a couple reasons uh one is

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.400
because

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.160
the book that I'm writing one of the

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.460
chapters big chapters is called Origins

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.780
and I realized like as as a society

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.539
um as a whole human race talk about the

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.760
lack of social cohesion we don't have a

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.760
shared origin story we don't have one

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.260
that works

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.020
we don't have one that's compelling and

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.120
it doesn't conflict like okay I believe

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.919
God made the world but I'm also

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:07.799
scientifically attuned

00:18:07.799 --> 00:18:12.120
um and I've been spending a lot of time

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.480
thinking like uh

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.480
um

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.980
and and you know I can send out the

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.260
course contentually and there's not much

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.740
in it because mostly what you do when

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.679
when you first start to talk about these

00:18:28.679 --> 00:18:30.660
things like Katie said the mystery is

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.220
you realize that we have all these

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.340
epistemic constraints

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.400
up down right left

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.760
um and so one of the

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.059
um goals of producing something like

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:50.700
Collective Insight practice is to

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.220
release the epistemic constraints

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.860
release the constraints of how we can

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.360
think

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.760
right this is

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.660
um in order so we can

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.720
um

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.940
in order so we can come up with a

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.880
compelling origin story I mean as as a

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.039
species we don't have one

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:17.820
we just don't have one and

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.020
I find that very peculiar after all the

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.000
time we are here

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.620
um there have been times when we've had

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.700
them

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.960
um they've worked I guess for a while

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.280
um but

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.179
there's all these Logistics like

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:38.880
logistical problems with our brain

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.880
um so one of the things for example I've

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.760
also been doing a lot of talking in

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.220
August you might have noticed

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.539
um

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:50.580
and I've had great conversations with

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.679
Greg Enriquez and he's starting to

00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:55.760
realize that

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.000
as he moves down his stack

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.059
uh once he gets to matter he buys into

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:05.100
Newtonian

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.500
causally and I'm like well that's your

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.299
problem that's why you have to have such

00:20:09.299 --> 00:20:11.760
a strong emergent system

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.120
because how do you reconcile our sense

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.260
of life

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.380
and choice and freedom and the fact that

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.020
we're made up of matter like there's a

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.960
there's a there's a double bind his

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.840
system has placed him and John traviki

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.740
in

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.900
and so

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.960
um

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.799
there is no place to go and find the

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:40.559
answer to this question currently as far

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.480
as I'm concerned

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.240
um there's other people offering certain

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.679
Alternatives like uh David J Temple

00:20:49.679 --> 00:20:52.140
which is a pseudonym for Gaffney and

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.440
Steins Cosmo erotic humanism they start

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.900
from metaphysical principles but they

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.720
just they just start from there

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.539
this is also you'll find a huge

00:21:03.539 --> 00:21:06.120
epistemic complaint constraint it is a

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.460
complaint also

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.320
um and I was going to write it in the

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.500
course content but it's it was too hard

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.480
to

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.320
um to describe that way and I'll just

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.919
describe it in and that is one of the

00:21:22.919 --> 00:21:25.919
biggest epistemic constraints we have or

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:28.260
one of the most fundamental I think you

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.140
get a lot of the other things right like

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.440
there's many many is

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.880
um

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.460
is refer is is this is the uh

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.460
is verbalized or represented by the Zen

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.760
Cohen one hand clapping

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.299
and what do I mean by that when once we

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:53.220
start to do this practice you're going

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.460
to notice that the mind is going to say

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.919
okay you can say God that's the one hand

00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:00.659
God and then you're going to say well

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:02.280
who put God there

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.919
the Mind always wants something on the

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:07.020
other side like before there was

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.460
something there was nothing

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.780
but then you you put like you have an

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.520
idea that that nothing is something

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.120
right and so for every this we have to

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.380
have of that

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.440
so all these original origin stories

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.120
they have a feminine principle and then

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.740
they have a masculine principle they

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.380
have a Yen and they are young and and

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.840
there might be the case

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.120
that everything's always been this way

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.820
and that's just the truth that would be

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.059
a one-hand clapping uh

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:41.900
um insight

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.600
that this whole thing of like where do

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.880
things start and where are they going is

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.559
itself problematic

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.100
um now

00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:02.280
that is an experience that

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:08.220
may happen in this in this

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.080
um practice

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.059
and there's a lot of things that might

00:23:12.059 --> 00:23:14.880
happen in this practice

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.000
um but I just put that one there because

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.919
if you can

00:23:19.919 --> 00:23:24.860
if if you start to toy with

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.720
releasing the need for if there is this

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.780
then there must be something else

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.059
to balance it

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:37.620
um then where your Insight will lead is

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.520
um will be where

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.500
a lot where very few people have

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.780
articulated it before does that make

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:50.419
sense like like we're interested in

00:23:50.419 --> 00:23:52.380
allowing

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.659
our frames

00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:58.440
to reveal themselves and then for us to

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.520
ask them to step aside

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.620
now we do want to end up with an origin

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.880
story

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.200
um

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.200
so it will coalesce into some kind of

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.059
framing eventually

00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:14.280
uh if if there's no you know if it has

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.000
no no constraints it's not going to be a

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.860
story you can tell

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:22.200
um and

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.360
um

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.780
[Music]

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.900
that's that's also in the mix but

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:28.740
um

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.620
were also being practical Collective

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.940
insect practice

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.980
is interested in in actual outcomes

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.620
um and in this case is that we don't

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.780
have a compelling origin story that's

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.960
consilient with

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.480
spiritual intuition and some kind of

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.059
scientific reasonableness I'm not saying

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:53.400
reductive materialism

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.640
um that's not going to work but

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.700
um

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.000
yeah does that make sense that in terms

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.740
of what we're after here I'm going to

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.539
give you instructions to do Collective

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:08.880
Insight practice and part of this then

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.280
is just to practice this this

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.200
methodology

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.340
um

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.039
um which we won't be able to be really

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:20.580
good at it uh day one but we'll gonna

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.140
use it throughout all these um

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.659
these four modules

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:30.539
um to finish the year and then you know

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:33.659
we can actually as we build capacity we

00:25:33.659 --> 00:25:35.100
can actually start asking questions

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.020
about Collective Insight practice itself

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:40.020
as a as a practice again

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.940
um so so

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.220
we're doing we're doing both these

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.840
things we're in service to a question

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.299
that's in service to an outcome and

00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:50.760
we're going to practice a technology

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.419
that is a little weird now

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.520
I am going to teach you Collective

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.740
Insight practice in a way that I would

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.900
never teach

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.880
a new group okay like do not try this at

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.020
home

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:10.260
um one of the reasons why is we don't

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.659
have to practice presencing in this

00:26:12.659 --> 00:26:14.520
group we've been presencing ourselves

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.919
for nine months so

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:19.020
it's not something we have to worry

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.200
about it's already done it's never you

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.940
know it's never done done but what I'm

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.520
saying is like that part

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.159
we can just trust it we don't have to

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:31.260
pay attention to it

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.020
um we've I've we've snuck it in behind

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.600
the scenes you're already done with that

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.179
that's that's already happened

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:41.580
um and as we know in real life with new

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.940
groups or even uh in certain situations

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.779
like if we all met in person there would

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:51.720
be some some new territory to do a

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.480
little bit of that that in so this is

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.380
not oh it's not it's not for uh regular

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:00.840
people that this is more High weirdness

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.000
for this this group so does that make

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.820
sense like you would never uh

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.580
um and and not only have we presenced

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.100
ourselves but the amount of trust we

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.860
have in Bonnie's weird kind of things

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.000
until

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.659
kind of uh Wander through the thickets

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:20.580
not knowing where you're going

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.159
um is also a big part of establishing

00:27:23.159 --> 00:27:25.980
establishing this stuff so

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:29.520
um with that caveat in mind

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.240
um

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.120
um are there any questions about so far

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.520
of where we're done

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.500
um

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.400
okay Collective Insight practice is not

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.919
dialogic

00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:47.360
it's not a conversation

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.419
now you may slip into conversational

00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:56.159
portions as we do but it's not a

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:58.559
dialogue

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:01.400
uh

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.100
in this phase of where we're at where

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.779
the words you're going to say don't

00:28:06.779 --> 00:28:08.700
matter

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.100
huh

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.120
um and so uh we're going to unmute and

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.000
we're just going to talk when we have

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.120
something to say and if if two people

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.340
are talking at the same time it's okay

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.860
you just listen to the energy because

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:29.580
the words do not matter

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.700
it's not dialogical practice

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.100
at this space

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.700
okay

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.100
um it's it's a little harder for two

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.640
people talking at once on Zoom because

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.840
the the cough the cacophony uh

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.380
is weird in in a big room it's it's like

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.880
when you're at a party and there's a lot

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.940
of talking so uh with zoom it's a little

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.919
harder because we actually for the

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:05.279
technology forces us to take turns more

00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:08.100
um so we're gonna have to

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.500
um uh avoid we'll have to work through

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.260
that okay so I've I'm just gonna say

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.059
we're going into a collective Insight

00:29:15.059 --> 00:29:17.640
practice uh around the question of

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.100
origins of this

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.620
um and uh just doing the instructions

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.860
number one is don't try this at home I

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.559
would never uh start a collective

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:31.260
Insight practice with uh naive people

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.000
the way we are we're just gonna dump

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.580
dump into it Collective Insight practice

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.740
we don't have to do presencing because

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:39.659
we've been presencing uh with each other

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:41.940
for nine months

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:42.600
um

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.539
and this phase of our process the words

00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:47.880
don't matter

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.820
it's not a dialogical process the words

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.380
don't matter

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.820
um and so we're gonna when we start

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.860
we're gonna unmute and if you're talking

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.840
if more than one person's talking at the

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.039
same time

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:01.500
um you just that's you just honor honor

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.740
that energy okay uh the words the words

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.440
don't matter at this phase some might

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.240
all of a sudden

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.820
there might be a big thing

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.580
a big thing and everyone will recognize

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.880
it at the same time but if you're

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.039
looking for big big things at this

00:30:20.039 --> 00:30:22.919
period in the process uh that probably

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:24.840
won't work

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.480
um does that make sense

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.700
oh yeah it's a weird thing with this

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.820
thing

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.740
you see kids in the playground they're

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.240
making sense to each other all the time

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.919
and they're hardly even using words just

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:43.260
like blabbering whatever right so uh we

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.240
want the words to come out of our mouth

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.960
the way we want the dance to come out of

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.700
our bodies

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.399
completely independent of our minds okay

00:30:53.399 --> 00:30:55.500
so you're not talking to each other now

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.539
you're not talking to each other

00:30:57.539 --> 00:31:01.320
you're talking to the universe

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.120
if you like this word you know talking

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.080
to the logos

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.840
if we already had the Insight then we

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.000
could talk to someone and say tell me

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.919
you know like

00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:16.620
um so this is why it's not dialogical

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.080
you're not talking to each other

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.020
you're talking to the universe you might

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:24.779
say something like what is your original

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:28.520
face like what is your original face

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.899
like like

00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:32.399
like

00:31:32.399 --> 00:31:33.840
you know

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.080
I have that brings up some

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.440
powerful energy in me

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.679
right so you want it to be around this

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:49.039
question that would be one way I would

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:52.140
talk to the universe

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.500
um other it some people you'll I'm not

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:58.380
sure here but we'll talk to God it

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.299
doesn't matter you're not talking to

00:32:00.299 --> 00:32:02.659
each other

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.799
so however that

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.659
frames it and it can turn around the

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:14.880
different questions might capture your

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.100
imagination

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.220
um

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.860
does that make sense

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.279
okay

00:32:26.039 --> 00:32:30.980
or I also wrote I was supposed walking

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.620
and else I also wrote

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.679
who is my original mother you know we

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:40.020
had this cat who died this month that's

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.440
it actually a couple of days ago and

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.179
watching the process is very interesting

00:32:45.179 --> 00:32:48.179
and it takes you to these questions it

00:32:48.179 --> 00:32:51.360
takes you to these kinds of questions

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.480
um

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.700
okay

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.480
now in this process your body uh may be

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.360
doing all kinds of things

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.360
um the energy is likely to move

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.320
uh in habitual patterns I don't think

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.820
this is a big deal for this group you

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.960
guys have been doing a lot of group

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.260
process but you would tell people that

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.500
who just to make the distinction

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.120
um that as you're pumping this question

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.159
um in this way

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:28.860
you're really asking your body to answer

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.679
the question and so all kinds of

00:33:31.679 --> 00:33:34.080
energies might happen

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.260
and at first

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.480
the likelihood is that those energies

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:43.620
will take kind of Habitual patterns

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.539
and that's okay

00:33:45.539 --> 00:33:49.019
um but your body is going to search for

00:33:49.019 --> 00:33:50.539
the

00:33:50.539 --> 00:33:52.620
dispositional state

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.760
that can

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.940
create a different kind of awareness

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.760
around the question

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.399
so we're not interested in reporting

00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:06.779
like

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:09.659
what your body is feeling like and

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:12.839
whether you're angry or frustrated uh

00:34:12.839 --> 00:34:14.879
you're just gonna notice that and say

00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:17.099
yeah yeah just like when you're doing

00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:19.320
yoga and your body's like oh please

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.119
please and you're like you need on your

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:24.859
and your calf muscle is is is is is

00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:27.000
complaining and it's saying please

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
please and you're like yeah I know I

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.800
know but we have to get to the other

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.320
side you gotta we gotta release you can

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.300
do it you can do it okay so we're not

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.980
interested in

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.040
spending much time trying to understand

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.440
the body knows how to do it some people

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.040
uh we don't care what course it takes

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.520
and we might be surprised that you're

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.679
not sure that they'll do that here but

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.139
some people are start if I ask what is

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.839
my mother's original face then my body

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:00.300
might say mother and then I have this

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:04.200
thing crying about my mother but it's

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.099
not really about that

00:35:07.099 --> 00:35:10.020
your body at first just like doing yoga

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.000
it's it's going to take habitual

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.300
habituated patterns

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.079
and the body is uh he's got that it is

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:20.880
only the body is capable of the answer

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.680
and then the body will serve it up to

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.079
our minds where we could make a story

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:29.339
about it for health okay so does that

00:35:29.339 --> 00:35:31.800
make sense that that I mean that it's

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.859
not something else it's this this this

00:35:34.859 --> 00:35:37.200
this weird thing plus it's consistent

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.400
with

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.859
um the question which is Bodies In Space

00:35:40.859 --> 00:35:43.619
you know I mean it's an instance of us

00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:46.800
of cell itself

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.040
um okay now I'm going to give you an

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.280
example of why the Insight process has

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.380
already started

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.079
so I wrote that course content you may

00:35:58.079 --> 00:36:01.040
or may not have read it

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:04.800
I actually cut most of it out

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.280
but I did have this little

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.540
um

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.599
I did have this little uh

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:16.800
visual of the cognitive bow tie did

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.500
everybody see that I can put this up

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.760
on my screen

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.920
uh share screen

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.960
I guess just going to give you an idea

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.359
of how Collective an Insight practice

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:35.520
happens share a screen oh uh basic

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.800
so you may or may not have

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.780
um this

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.579
course content

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:44.280
uh

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.500
but what I want to point you to is this

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.320
drawing I mean I made lots of drawings

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.060
and you if you saw the video you could

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.079
tell I just couldn't I couldn't the the

00:36:54.079 --> 00:36:56.640
dimensionality of the question is

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.820
extremely hard to work with uh so I just

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.060
give you some example of what happens in

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.020
my body mind when I go there but

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.619
I had put this cognitive bow tie right

00:37:10.619 --> 00:37:12.780
it's like a cognitive light cone in two

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.160
directions

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:18.300
and Rita Leduc almost

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.060
had a heart attack

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.520
because

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.579
this is her cognitive light cone that

00:37:26.579 --> 00:37:28.980
she experienced

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.380
during one of our nature abstraction

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.040
drawing experiences

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:38.040
there was like this huge like connection

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.839
and she reached out to me we talked

00:37:39.839 --> 00:37:43.619
about it and this is

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:46.320
with Collective Insight practice is all

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.619
about to kind of get it like we talked

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:52.440
about that actually the cognitive light

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.260
cone is they are not there at the same

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.020
time and she's tapping into some kind of

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.900
pure abstraction that seems to have

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.859
something to do with the question I

00:38:04.859 --> 00:38:07.460
don't know

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.320
but that's her that's her medium right

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.720
that's her medium so it's not like and

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.780
mine is always models

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.820
um and so

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.880
um

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.700
that this at this phase in the process

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:34.740
this is the kind of uh kind of results

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.859
that we can we can expect or experience

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.260
so I'm going to mute and everybody else

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.820
is going to unmute

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.720
and what you're going to do is if there

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.579
are words happening in your head

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:07.619
you're just gonna say them

00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:10.260
the words might be I don't know what to

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:14.359
say I mean not my question is

00:39:15.839 --> 00:39:20.820
because you don't want to

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.660
strategize what you're thinking by

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.520
keeping it in your head eventually the

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.300
words will go away

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.160
but if you're maintaining like

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.500
an internal dialogue all your energy

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.119
will stay

00:39:39.119 --> 00:39:41.099
in your in your head

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:43.500
so this is why we have to talk at the

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.940
same time

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:46.079
so

00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:50.160
to start you're going to

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.720
just sit without

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.520
words in your head and just just maybe

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.940
just this one word origin origin maybe

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.960
just that one word

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.000
and then for this phase you're going to

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.119
be very Vigilant if a sentence starts in

00:40:15.119 --> 00:40:17.700
your head you're going to say it

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.440
doesn't matter what it is

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.560
um and but as you're saying it you you

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.800
want to say it as soon as the words is

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.560
starting you want to say it so be very

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.420
vigilant

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.560
here

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.599
so

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:42.320
I can do it right now okay so so

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.780
uh so

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.300
I didn't let it get very far because I

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.700
was

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.940
in the same time

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.200
pacing of the words themselves

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:00.660
this very important part of this project

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.380
practice

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.300
and it's not good enough just to

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.820
pretend saying it in your head okay so

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.260
this is how we're going to start this is

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.260
why we have to talk over each other

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.359
um you're going to

00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:21.780

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.659
the question you can discuss and the

01:13:51.659 --> 01:13:54.179
nature of the experience also

01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:57.179
um so we'll do a 15 minute uh

01:13:57.179 --> 01:13:58.800
conversation

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.500
and then we'll come back and uh

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.420
share as a whole

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.060
um

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.360
options

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.460
15 minutes

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:22.260
and uh enjoy your company and enjoy your

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.040
conversation

01:14:41.219 --> 01:14:43.380
I hit the wrong button

01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:45.540
I hit the wrong button and got ejected

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.000
out of my

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.480
problem

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.800
there's an EVO I I hit the wrong button

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.640
I got ejected

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.040
yeah we were sad you couldn't finish her

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.780
your sentence

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.560
thank you

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.360
that was revelatory whatever I was gonna

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.679
say

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:25.219
foreign

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.820
I'll jump in so does anybody want to

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:42.739
share anything from their Breakout

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.840
okay

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.840
uh I had to buy bulbs from the high

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.880
school

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.500
and I'm now I'm thinking I didn't really

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.659
look carefully maybe it's just some kid

01:16:00.659 --> 01:16:02.880
with a great scam running it for each

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:09.020
scam uh either way all right

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.340
what do we got

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.500
I would particularly like to hear from

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:21.020
the people who did not say very much

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.020
I don't know how do I know if I was

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:31.500
someone who didn't say very much

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.679
was that one of them yeah you were okay

01:16:34.679 --> 01:16:39.480
I had like Ray Katie Sandra Katie and

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:42.900
zalt uh Cheryl

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.659
I don't think JJ said much David didn't

01:16:45.659 --> 01:16:48.300
say much uh

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.060
so there's a lot of you anyways uh it

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.340
doesn't happen I just don't want the

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.960
people that didn't say anything not to

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.840
say anything but uh very interested in

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.179
what you guys talked about uh yeah just

01:17:00.179 --> 01:17:02.940
a deep brief okay well I can just start

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.260
I guess

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.219
um

01:17:05.219 --> 01:17:07.260
I didn't have so much of a question but

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.140
at some point the the words just started

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.640
to become like

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.980
um I just the image of uh you know

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.860
particle physics like and words seem to

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.260
be scattering amplitudes like it became

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.820
like the coherence

01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.040
like that process I just almost like saw

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.800
words just fly through you know kind of

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.420
becoming

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.820
um where they first were nothing

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:30.659
um

01:17:30.659 --> 01:17:32.880
and so yeah it

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:35.219
um well I have a personal View and like

01:17:35.219 --> 01:17:37.500
also like the collective view like I

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.420
what came up with the question of uh how

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.520
did we navigate the space together here

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.100
because it was almost like as if ah we

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.659
all have this kind of like of course

01:17:45.659 --> 01:17:47.100
it's the same language but we're all

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:49.140
coming from a place that's almost like

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.659
we were kind of you know like as if the

01:17:51.659 --> 01:17:54.060
entanglements were looking for for like

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.380
the words were looking for each other

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.000
you know to kind of like start

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.460
constructing meanings and so it almost

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:02.040
felt like a collective navigation of

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:04.320
transcriptional space in some ways you

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.040
know

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:08.100
um and I also had strong synesthesia is

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.900
actually with words some words I can't

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.120
even remember now but you know I can

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.860
remember the shape the color the

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:17.280
sometimes the gravity even like the um

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.800
yeah the weight of a word and I did

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.300
notice that sometimes I would speak and

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.920
I don't know what I'd love to hear this

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.420
experience like something I would speak

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.520
speak it and there was like a bit of a

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.920
silence or something as if some words

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.080
appear to have more weight or something

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.760
like that I don't know

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.050
so

01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:35.880
[Music]

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:39.239
so that was that's me uh yeah

01:18:39.239 --> 01:18:42.080
complete

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.440
you can speak to having been a little

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.940
quiet by just sharing something that I

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.159
shared with the breakout group

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.060
um

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.060
at first I was just listening

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.920
um and mostly listening to the words

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.659
that were just the loudest so whoever

01:18:57.659 --> 01:18:59.940
came through the loudest

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.980
um

01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:04.080
and eventually I got this kind of like

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.600
fun playful Vibe I noticed myself tuning

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.480
into the things that were silly

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.239
um but with like a childish fondness to

01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:15.540
it not like an absurdity-ness to it

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.260
um

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:17.940
and I found myself becoming like very

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:19.020
joyous

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.420
and the only thing I would feel called

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.159
to say would be something coming from

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:24.900
that space so I feel like I kind of like

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.400
became a fixed point for that kind of

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.580
energy

01:19:28.679 --> 01:19:30.179
um

01:19:30.179 --> 01:19:32.640
so I would mostly feel called to say

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.380
something when something else had that

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.000
energy I would feel like I was amping it

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.380
up

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.280
um

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.360
but this was just like a thing that

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.679
happened I didn't really have a prior

01:19:40.679 --> 01:19:42.719
that this I wanted to be this way or

01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:44.760
something like that or which energy it

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.520
would be of any of them

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.659
um

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:52.400
yeah that's another one for me

01:19:54.179 --> 01:19:56.760
um in the beginning I had a lot of

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.679
I was quiet because I was I was kind of

01:19:58.679 --> 01:20:00.179
battling with myself

01:20:00.179 --> 01:20:01.620
um the words that were coming into my

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.000
mind were

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.159
were kind of like self-critical or other

01:20:05.159 --> 01:20:06.780
critical I guess I was just like not

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.280
buying that these were like the

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.040
authentic words or something like that

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.960
um even if like they were the words that

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.100
were going to come out of me or someone

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.260
I would like I would tune in and hear

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.520
words coming from other people and I'm

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.440
like is this really like exactly what's

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.940
popping into your head at this moment I

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:22.320
didn't want to bring that energy into

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.840
the space so I but then I was like but

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.860
these are the words that are popping

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.840
into my head so I just battled with that

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.920
for a while

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.699
um and then I let all of that go

01:20:32.699 --> 01:20:33.780
um

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:36.600
and my experience became much more yeah

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.820
it became much more visual

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:39.900
um there's like a thread in my

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:43.020
meditation of like when I'm in tune with

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.540
the logos kind of like a purple that

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.280
takes more in space and expands and

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.900
contracts and something really cool that

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.239
happened was like the purple was joined

01:20:51.239 --> 01:20:53.280
by like a really bright fiery orange

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.140
that was very like particular and they

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:57.659
started like dancing together

01:20:57.659 --> 01:21:00.540
um and as that was happening the like

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.760
all the criticism of words just kind of

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.679
fell away and I found myself speaking a

01:21:04.679 --> 01:21:06.719
lot more and also um

01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:09.540
like reacting and like with music to

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.520
words that people were saying a lot even

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:14.400
more than just other words

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.679
um yeah yeah I feel like it heated up at

01:21:16.679 --> 01:21:18.360
the end but I also had I had some

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.219
self-consciousness throughout um like

01:21:20.219 --> 01:21:21.900
Joel said that

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:23.219
I think I

01:21:23.219 --> 01:21:25.679
yeah I found myself I was really quiet I

01:21:25.679 --> 01:21:27.480
was kind of like retreated back here I

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.920
was maybe saying words but very very

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.480
quietly maybe that wouldn't even be

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.480
picked up on Zoom yeah yeah I can't

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.040
confirm okay he was saying a decent

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.480
amount that I think was just like below

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.280
threshold for the mic yeah

01:21:45.199 --> 01:21:51.140
so as one of the identified Quiet Ones

01:21:51.659 --> 01:21:54.480
at at some point and not not very long

01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.340
into a few minutes into it like the

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.260
words just quit making sense

01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.760
and

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.400
and I just went into sound and the sound

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.640
and I just made sound and it was sort of

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.760
in the phenomenology of and then and

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.140
then I noticed there was like a

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.260
pulsation energy like I would go into

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:16.920
making sense and then into no sense and

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.159
and a lot of the energy felt like

01:22:19.159 --> 01:22:22.679
Contracting and then moving out moving

01:22:22.679 --> 01:22:25.080
in and and out like

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.199
over the longer period of time it's also

01:22:28.199 --> 01:22:31.020
very visual too

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:31.860
um

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.679
but mostly As like the words just fell

01:22:34.679 --> 01:22:36.360
up kind of

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.500
lost their coherence for me and

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.820
as far as sense making

01:22:47.219 --> 01:22:50.460
yeah I also had yeah there was just a

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.739
lot of it was just sound coming through

01:22:52.739 --> 01:22:55.080
but also it was very much connected with

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.719
so emotion and I also had like book love

01:22:57.719 --> 01:23:00.719
send us easier

01:23:00.719 --> 01:23:02.520
um yeah it was just sometimes it was

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:04.380
they were just like shapes you know and

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.179
like kind of when I was just kind of

01:23:06.179 --> 01:23:08.820
annotating or like outlining the shapes

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:11.040
with sound and like kind of my body

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.900
moving with that as well

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.659
it was like like I kept on one that kind

01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:17.100
of kept coming around for me was like

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:19.020
kind of fold so it was like I was trying

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.420
to get there like it's like the edges of

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.520
these folds but folds in something

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:27.300
persistent like and yeah it's just kind

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.400
of the

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.400
just

01:23:33.659 --> 01:23:36.420
yeah noting these these shapes and

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:40.340
pulses and rhythms like

01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:58.560
okay I'll speak up

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.739
um

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:09.960
I thought it was

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:12.020
um

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:19.920
really interesting to watch my

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.100
way my pattern through the half hour

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.820
experience

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.940
and I saw

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:32.300
emotional effect

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:37.219
for me

01:24:37.219 --> 01:24:41.280
I had a rebellious energy

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:45.120
and the rebellion was

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.400
yeah the F and words do matter

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:54.560
and I had to come back to

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:58.620
focus on a search and focus on feeling

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:01.140
the energy

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:02.820
and I thought it was interesting in the

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:04.260
Breakout

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:08.460
that emotion was noted frustration in

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:11.960
the experience as well

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.580
then in the breakout Matt asked the

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.260
question have we ever done this before

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:23.880
have any of us

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:27.780
and it really opened me up to this place

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.900
I've done it one-on-one in the pop-up

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:32.219
School

01:25:32.219 --> 01:25:33.900
but never

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.600
part of 20 or whatever it is I don't

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.179
know how many people here

01:25:39.179 --> 01:25:43.140
and I found that energy to be a wild

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:45.179
energy

01:25:45.179 --> 01:25:47.640
and reaching

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:51.239
into that energy was very exciting for

01:25:51.239 --> 01:25:53.420
me

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.219
and in it involved a mutuality also with

01:25:59.219 --> 01:26:01.500
the one sound I heard and what jolt was

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:04.500
talking about that amplification what

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.480
did I amplify

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:10.699
and where was that in my pattern

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.739
and then Sandra

01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:21.020
when I was sharing in the Breakout

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:24.540
reminded me of when we were in your

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.580
Corral Bonnie

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:31.020
doing the Touch dance exercise that

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.460
Aaron

01:26:32.460 --> 01:26:34.260
gave us

01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.659
and she said something

01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:38.940
in the Breakout

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:42.060
that I took a contra position to in the

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:44.280
Breakout

01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.100
and so in the breakout we did this kind

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:49.320
of mutual

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.699
dance with the energy

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.679
she said looking for was constraining

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.020
and looking at was expansive

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:08.580
and I feel

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:10.860
looking for

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.900
is expansive

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.199
and looking at is constraining

01:27:16.199 --> 01:27:19.920
so in our breakout we danced with that

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:22.020
energy

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:25.400
and I touched her first

01:27:25.739 --> 01:27:28.400
not really

01:27:33.239 --> 01:27:37.040
I got your shoulder first

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.239
I I you know I noticed

01:27:45.239 --> 01:27:46.679
the

01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:50.840
the shifting between

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.699
okay we're going to find the origin

01:27:53.699 --> 01:27:57.480
we're looking for the origin we're like

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.179
you know where where is it and how is it

01:28:00.179 --> 01:28:03.840
going to show itself

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.460
and

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.840
um

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.239
I think like Katie I think I was saying

01:28:09.239 --> 01:28:12.480
more than what was being picked up

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:15.420
because I would you know hear something

01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:17.639
from someone and then

01:28:17.639 --> 01:28:20.219
the images would come and it would it

01:28:20.219 --> 01:28:22.460
was

01:28:22.679 --> 01:28:26.159
like a a synesthesia kind of experience

01:28:26.159 --> 01:28:28.860
somewhere between color and form and

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.320
movement and

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.960
a recurring

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:38.340
sense of a Whirlpool or a vortex

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.460
um

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.480
and at the end of our breakout when we

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.760
had kind of

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.340
sensed into our experience

01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:55.260
somehow that is the origin

01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:00.239
somehow all of all of what was revealed

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:01.800
through us

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.600
feels like the origin and there aren't

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.500
any words for it

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.100
so that's very interesting

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.719
trust to me

01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:14.840
um

01:29:17.219 --> 01:29:22.219
because one of the things that

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.560
um if you if we as we practice this

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.280
is what KU is describing in Avo as a

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.520
dissolution and stuff is

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.540
um

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:37.219
you begin to

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:41.760
be present when the word form is just

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.940
starting before it becomes a word

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:48.719
and if you're if you if you're dedicated

01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:51.719
to trying to say exactly as the word

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:52.920
comes up

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.960
like you start to ask because this seems

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.699
like the word coming up is it starts

01:29:59.699 --> 01:30:01.500
with an S

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.159
um

01:30:02.159 --> 01:30:06.300
you'll start to be able to understand

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:09.000
uh like Katie said there's a structure

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.620
that happens when the words make sense

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:12.420
and there's a structure where they're

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.440
just

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:16.199
there's nothing to them

01:30:16.199 --> 01:30:20.040
but anyways what I'm what

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.520
you just said is an interesting question

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.000
because if you understand

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.920
the origins of the word

01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:36.000
does that have something to tell us

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.580
about the origins of everything it's an

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:42.179
interesting question and I know evil is

01:30:42.179 --> 01:30:43.860
going like this because this is the

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:47.219
contemplation of the logos itself so

01:30:47.219 --> 01:30:49.739
um there's a instance of itself so what

01:30:49.739 --> 01:30:52.679
you were reporting as in practice is

01:30:52.679 --> 01:30:55.440
interesting phenomenon to think of in

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.020
terms of the question

01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:00.380
um yeah

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:16.219
yes I'll take on um

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.800
sometimes I feel like I had a board

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.080
maybe unpleasant experience with other

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.179
people and

01:31:24.179 --> 01:31:26.100
um I don't want to be a

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.420
Downer or whatever but

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.080
uh

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:34.139
I guess at the start I was you know when

01:31:34.139 --> 01:31:36.300
other people would say a word it would

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.800
just pop into my head so then I would

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.260
just repeat that often

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.520
um

01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.380
I got to a place where like there was

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.440
images and I didn't know if I should say

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.100
what those were

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:50.460
um

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.520
and then there was also moments where I

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.620
brought this up in the breakout where

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.860
I like felt like I could

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.540
like I felt like I could say something

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:03.659
that made sense but then I didn't just

01:32:03.659 --> 01:32:05.639
to follow the

01:32:05.639 --> 01:32:08.840
whatever the instruction

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.800
and then I think I'd

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.420
just kind of

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.340
got to a point where I was like kind of

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:15.480
exhausted

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:19.440
like exhausted was the big thing for me

01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:21.540
I was just getting tiring

01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.639
um and I was like oh maybe that's maybe

01:32:23.639 --> 01:32:25.500
that's why she wants us to do this I

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.179
don't know

01:32:27.179 --> 01:32:28.139
um

01:32:28.139 --> 01:32:30.600
and

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.179
and then it got me I guess and I think I

01:32:33.179 --> 01:32:34.620
I do this when I don't understand

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.360
something I feel

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.460
bad about myself or something like like

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:40.320
what's the point and it's like I don't

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.480
know and do other people know and I I

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.520
don't know I for some reason feel

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:47.040
frustrated and bad or I don't know I get

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:49.219
all

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.060
because I don't understand what's what's

01:32:51.060 --> 01:32:53.699
the point and

01:32:53.699 --> 01:32:55.440
I brought this up in the group I think I

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:57.960
said something like

01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.280
um

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.880
if we're trying to create a sword origin

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.560
story or we're trying to create

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.780
something here

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.280
if the

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:12.300
feelings or whatever comes up in me

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.659
isn't

01:33:14.659 --> 01:33:18.719
reported how are we supposed to do that

01:33:18.719 --> 01:33:21.179
okay so this is a good clarifying

01:33:21.179 --> 01:33:23.760
question around the practice itself yeah

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.860
so we're trying to do Collective Insight

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:29.040
practice which is done your your body

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.699
does the thinking not your mind

01:33:32.699 --> 01:33:35.580
um but I did say that it builds up

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.560
energy and the energy is going to flow

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.840
through common patterns so you're

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.080
beating up on yourself frustration

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.679
giggling these are common patterns

01:33:46.679 --> 01:33:49.020
um that that

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:49.679
um

01:33:49.679 --> 01:33:53.340
that the energy is still is is doing so

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:54.659
that's okay

01:33:54.659 --> 01:33:57.719
um what we're trying to do is

01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:59.940
um so the reason why we don't report on

01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:02.400
them and we report on them in a deeper

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.320
if this is perfectly fine because now

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.600
we're in conversation is because

01:34:10.159 --> 01:34:12.659
they're they're

01:34:12.659 --> 01:34:14.699
um

01:34:14.699 --> 01:34:16.139
because it's not the question we're

01:34:16.139 --> 01:34:19.920
asking first of all and also you need to

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:24.120
understand that they they just come up

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.300
for no reason the energy is start you're

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.560
starting to build up energy because

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.060
you're asking your body to do the

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.500
thinking

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.980
um you're the your our body Minds always

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:37.080
do something which is easier for us we

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.420
stop bladder and we don't even know what

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:41.460
the we're talking about right we

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:43.260
can talk about emergentism and this

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.000
emerges from that I asked this question

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.120
on Twitter if Consciousness emerges is

01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.580
emergent what does it emerge from and

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.860
you just get blah blah nobody knows no

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.620
one has a story we just so what happens

01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:57.659
is the common habit is we try to

01:34:57.659 --> 01:35:00.420
understand something deeply and they and

01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.940
we put the release valve blah blah blah

01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:05.040
blah blah blah blah and in that blah

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:07.320
blah blah so we're not doing that we're

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:09.960
not giving the body a release valve okay

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.900
so but we don't have practice doing this

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.699
so the body doesn't have a release valve

01:35:14.699 --> 01:35:18.960
so now it's like oh it it it's going to

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.420
go through a common whatever your common

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:24.120
pattern is when you have too much energy

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.520
G locked up in you was what your body

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.780
will do

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:30.600
now if you find yourself being

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.780
frustrated it is it is correct to in the

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:36.540
in the body's like wow this is stupid it

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:39.239
because your your body is trying to do

01:35:39.239 --> 01:35:41.639
something and it wants to release that

01:35:41.639 --> 01:35:43.920
it releases it into the sentence this is

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.080
stupid you yes you should say this is

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.300
stupid and some people it was great some

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:49.800
people did

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.440
say what was coming up because you need

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.840
to it you need a little bit of release

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.280
but if you if you stick with saying

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.460
exactly what the sentence set is coming

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:05.280
you'll find your Bot your body isn't

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.060
having enough time to script the whole

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:11.100
blah blah blah blah so you're forcing

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.719
your body to do the work just like when

01:36:14.719 --> 01:36:17.580
you're doing yoga and you're stretching

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.100
a muscle you can't talk that muscle into

01:36:22.100 --> 01:36:24.960
expanding its range it just you just

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.780
have to let it

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.219
you know and if you've done that you see

01:36:29.219 --> 01:36:31.139
it'll pull this way and then it pulls on

01:36:31.139 --> 01:36:32.639
your knee and then it pulls under there

01:36:32.639 --> 01:36:34.920
and pulls on that and finally it doesn't

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:38.340
have any other choice and it lets go and

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.820
now you can do Insight practice because

01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:44.400
you need this energy

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.800
to have insights

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:49.560
and you can't have new insights if

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.320
you're using your old habitual ways of

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.219
talking

01:36:53.219 --> 01:36:55.679
if talking worked we'd solved the

01:36:55.679 --> 01:36:57.060
problem by now

01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.699
we need to change the muscle that does

01:36:59.699 --> 01:37:03.360
the primary fundamental processing of

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.880
information was trying to ask the body

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.639
to tell us something about reality

01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:11.940
it's something the body evolved to do

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:14.699
but in this practice when you're new

01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:16.920
these other things are happening and

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.020
it's hard it's hard work it's actually

01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:20.820
you get tired and this is why it gets

01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:22.199
silly sometimes because people are

01:37:22.199 --> 01:37:25.100
actually tired and that's okay

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:28.800
at this point we need release valves

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:32.699
um so the practice is hard uh from from

01:37:32.699 --> 01:37:35.880
that from that perspective

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:39.860
um and you just you just notice

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.960
that the there's the the words are

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.639
release valves

01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:46.500
um and they're gonna they're gonna take

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:49.020
the form that you're habituated to

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:51.120
so Magdalena for example okay use an

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.060
example she becomes interested in the

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:57.060
word stem and it you know so that's

01:37:57.060 --> 01:38:00.199
that's a it's just her way of of

01:38:00.199 --> 01:38:03.360
processing energy so and and yet she did

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.860
really well because you could tell she

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:07.380
thought she was on to something

01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:09.659
and you know Magdalene is she gonna talk

01:38:09.659 --> 01:38:11.639
for 45 minutes because she was talking

01:38:11.639 --> 01:38:14.340
about yeah finance and then like

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:16.380
something was really happening and then

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:19.380
it she didn't let it get ahead of her

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:22.560
and become a whole script yet so so this

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.100
is this is the practice and it shows up

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.719
in different ways with different people

01:38:27.719 --> 01:38:29.699
but

01:38:29.699 --> 01:38:31.260
um

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:34.560
but we're just we're just getting

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:38.760
started uh so to have come up with an

01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:41.100
answer yeah Magdalene is that okay I

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.380
used your example because of course no

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.480
it's great I mean I wanted to ask you

01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.100
something

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.679
um because uh we talked about this in

01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:52.679
the breakdown breakdown room can I just

01:38:52.679 --> 01:38:54.000
do one thing to math

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.659
but Matt you had this word teleoscopic

01:38:57.659 --> 01:39:01.199
that was very interesting I thought yeah

01:39:01.199 --> 01:39:03.480
because that wasn't like dialogue you

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:06.360
were like and and your mind didn't make

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.980
too much out of it it was more like

01:39:10.139 --> 01:39:13.620
yeah that was a very big big for me last

01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:16.100
one question

01:39:16.699 --> 01:39:21.780
I'm just in a kerfuffle right now um

01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.280
so when you have an Insight then

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.080
do you say that or how do you know

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:33.120
to make words in your mind

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.639
right at this phase only if it starts to

01:39:35.639 --> 01:39:37.199
make words in their mind you're mine

01:39:37.199 --> 01:39:40.739
because we we agreed

01:39:40.739 --> 01:39:43.800
if it's an Insight you will not lose it

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.719
you don't have to see this is the other

01:39:45.719 --> 01:39:46.920
thing we're afraid of if we don't

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.600
encapsulate it and package it and

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.060
thought and stuff but so

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:55.080
um so so yes only if if the words have

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.580
already gotten ahead of you and you go

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.920
ahead that was the deal you have to you

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.420
have to say it

01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:03.420
um but if you hold on to your insights

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:06.120
not well-formed it's you can tell it's

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.340
big

01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:11.580
don't rush words onto it

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.380
but because I felt like I had little

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:15.840
like feelings under in my mouth yeah

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.960
yeah that it was like oh it's like juicy

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.300
but yes that's your body started

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.880
thinking when you got that word and I

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.159
wanted to

01:40:26.159 --> 01:40:29.219
say that yeah appropriate

01:40:29.219 --> 01:40:32.520
I no well did the words come in your

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:35.340
mind or just the no no images of a word

01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:38.880
came in my mind okay so now then you did

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.780
right

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:42.179
yeah yeah

01:40:42.179 --> 01:40:44.540
you

01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:48.540
it was triggered by a word I mean you

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:50.820
kind of like grabbed that word but then

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:53.340
your body started to think

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.699
um yeah so that that was good and I

01:40:56.699 --> 01:40:57.659
don't know if you're exhausted

01:40:57.659 --> 01:40:59.340
afterwards that was quite late in the

01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:00.780
process but

01:41:00.780 --> 01:41:02.880
um that's the body thinking

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:05.340
um yeah

01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:05.880
um

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:10.560
okay Magdalena sorry no no no it's great

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:14.100
this is great I mean I I have these you

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.719
know pretty

01:41:15.719 --> 01:41:19.860
all right so I I was curious about why I

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:23.120
was yawning so much

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:26.100
I mean as a kind of I don't know if

01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:30.260
you'd call that a biomarker or yeah

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:35.159
I didn't I didn't feel tired it was like

01:41:35.159 --> 01:41:40.040
I needed to yawn I mean the yawning

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:43.500
was actually

01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:47.520
the way it was hap

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:50.219
go ahead sorry right he asked me a

01:41:50.219 --> 01:41:51.540
question oh

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:54.239
um so so the yawning and then the other

01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:57.600
thing was I really could not open my

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:01.139
eyes I mean the minute I did I was

01:42:01.139 --> 01:42:04.320
 you know I just

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.380
it just short-tercuted everything yeah

01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.400
so so the other yawning is because you

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:13.380
were packing a lot of energy there and

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:16.860
also not letting too many words so

01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:21.840
yeah the that structure is still yawning

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:25.020
yeah you know yeah so yeah

01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:28.139
and so and did the third thing I mean

01:42:28.139 --> 01:42:31.920
from uh just it was it was the the

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.199
needing to be blind

01:42:34.199 --> 01:42:39.300
and the yawning oh and and the rocking

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.480
you know it just really went into

01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.100
rocking

01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:44.880
um

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:48.900
so whatever just wanted to wrapping off

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.239
also the body

01:42:51.239 --> 01:42:53.699
that's common for people who are trying

01:42:53.699 --> 01:42:56.820
to think with body you rock

01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.000
you know we go like like this

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.340
um uh that's why walking meditation

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:05.699
quite often produces insights

01:43:05.699 --> 01:43:07.800
um so these are all

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.239
yeah the body and last thing in the

01:43:12.239 --> 01:43:15.840
breakout room when we arrived I I really

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.540
just wanted us to continue to speak over

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:20.280
each other like the whole idea of taking

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:24.239
turns was so annoying in a way I mean I

01:43:24.239 --> 01:43:25.920
wanted to hear what people were gonna

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.159
say but it was like

01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:31.139
now let's just continue and see what

01:43:31.139 --> 01:43:33.239
happens you know

01:43:33.239 --> 01:43:35.780
whatever

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:39.239
I filter on to run this a lot longer

01:43:39.239 --> 01:43:42.420
yeah it felt like it went by very fast

01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:44.900
for me

01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:47.880
I'm really be really interested to see

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:49.800
what happens if this goes for an hour or

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:52.080
two hours or something outrageous for

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:53.159
three days

01:43:53.159 --> 01:43:55.860
oh my God

01:43:55.860 --> 01:43:58.199
any other comments

01:43:58.199 --> 01:44:00.540
I did get some insights that I'll share

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.020
at the end

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.100
time dilation

01:44:12.659 --> 01:44:15.860
I felt really drawn

01:44:17.159 --> 01:44:19.199
to like have this experience in person

01:44:19.199 --> 01:44:21.179
or to try this one-on-one visual because

01:44:21.179 --> 01:44:24.119
uh definitely the impact of anything

01:44:24.119 --> 01:44:25.860
that he said was like so much

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:28.619
energetically stronger than it was it

01:44:28.619 --> 01:44:30.060
was almost like Zoom was kind of like

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:31.800
one Collective that was like pretty

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.679
quiet energetically for me and then like

01:44:34.679 --> 01:44:36.060
his was just like

01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:38.639
every time he would say something

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:39.960
um and I don't think that's just because

01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.100
of our connection I think it's because

01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:42.780
we're like literally right here next to

01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:44.159
each other I'm really curious what it

01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:46.380
would be like in person physically I

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.780
think that would change a lot yeah I

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.360
mean this is you know I don't you know

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:53.280
me I'm elected to do any of these things

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.320
online

01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:57.600
um and what happens is the synesthesia

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:01.679
between the bodies becomes extremely uh

01:45:01.679 --> 01:45:03.900
extremely

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.900
um interactive right

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.320
um so it's very hard

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.020
you know to be interactive without

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:16.260
language on Zoom um it happens uh but

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:18.780
certainly when we're doing Collective

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.659
body thinking uh it's it's good to have

01:45:21.659 --> 01:45:24.300
bodies in space

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.420
um

01:45:32.719 --> 01:45:36.540
and can I just say that

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.880
they being

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.600
uh being on Zoom became part of it for

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:45.179
me because I was I talked about this in

01:45:45.179 --> 01:45:48.540
our breakout session how I felt like I

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:50.219
was

01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:50.900
um

01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:54.300
pinging off my environment and I could

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.659
sense how everyone else was too and that

01:45:57.659 --> 01:45:58.940
that

01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:02.280
uh intermingling of all the different

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:05.040
environments was

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.699
um

01:46:05.699 --> 01:46:08.940
it became part of it and it was

01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:11.100
it was also part of what made the whole

01:46:11.100 --> 01:46:12.960
thing feel so trippy

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:16.020
yeah so this is a very good point

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:18.300
um um so we're not

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:21.540
we're not asking we're not connected to

01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:23.580
each other through dialogue we're

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:27.179
connected through

01:46:27.179 --> 01:46:30.060
reality or the Earth or the source right

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.980
and so

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.199
um and you know so this will move us on

01:46:34.199 --> 01:46:37.860
to the next instruction if we build on

01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.600
it I don't know we have to you know we

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.260
have to we have to start but so I was

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:45.659
connected to the question and my

01:46:45.659 --> 01:46:48.300
environment and this was what came out

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.840
for me I had uh this was quite toward

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:54.659
the end and

01:46:54.659 --> 01:47:00.239
um and something was was percolating

01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:04.320
um and I started and it started with

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:08.119
this phrase dead cat theorem

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.739
and

01:47:10.739 --> 01:47:11.639
um

01:47:11.639 --> 01:47:14.520
then someone said Source return to the

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.080
source after right after I said got dead

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.600
cat theorem someone said Source return

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:24.119
to the source now when our cat died we

01:47:24.119 --> 01:47:26.820
wrapped her in a t-shirt that

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:30.480
we had screen printed

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.139
uh for a conference a long time ago and

01:47:34.139 --> 01:47:36.000
it was called flowing to the source so I

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.860
had dead cat thermal and then someone

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.980
says source and then we buried this cat

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:44.580
and before flowing to the source now I

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:45.960
have a three right

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:49.020
and I'm thinking something is work this

01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:51.900
is Insight practice like something

01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:56.460
is happening here and then I um what was

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.520
interesting about this cat was she had

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.280
pancreatic cancer so the last two days

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.560
we actually thought she had rigor mortis

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.739
but she wasn't dead so you know because

01:48:07.739 --> 01:48:09.960
their muscles her cells were dying at

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.659
this level and she's quite awake and

01:48:12.659 --> 01:48:14.520
responsive

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:17.520
um that was very interesting to me like

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:20.780
the fact that

01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:23.159
you know the process was very

01:48:23.159 --> 01:48:25.080
interesting and the other thing about it

01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.179
is

01:48:27.179 --> 01:48:29.460
um this is one of Sandy's favorite

01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:33.840
animals and uh he really wanted to have

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.179
her die at home we stopped feeding her

01:48:36.179 --> 01:48:38.520
protein and we shed her

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:43.560
um cucumber juice with pure raid summer

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:45.000
squash

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.480
um which gave her some time to

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:51.239
um you know she got really thin but

01:48:51.239 --> 01:48:53.760
um but

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.780
all right so I went in to see her and I

01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:00.600
really like the energy came up in me

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.199
like I was and I never tell people you

01:49:04.199 --> 01:49:06.719
have to put your cat down right

01:49:06.719 --> 01:49:10.080
and I walked out and he said he asked me

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.940
yesterday did I have to go to my mom's

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:13.739
that was on Thursday and I said no

01:49:13.739 --> 01:49:15.960
because he was going to say maybe we

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:18.980
should take her to the vet so this this

01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:21.179
realization that it was pretty bad

01:49:21.179 --> 01:49:23.159
happened all at once and she he said

01:49:23.159 --> 01:49:24.540
well I don't know I want to go in and

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.179
check her and she died right at the time

01:49:27.179 --> 01:49:30.840
he was contemplating that it was enough

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.760
um so there was a lot going on my point

01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.280
is is that in Collective Insight

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:38.699
practice whatever the world is showing

01:49:38.699 --> 01:49:41.280
you in your local thing is part of the

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:43.500
practice you have to let the world in

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:47.159
it's not dialogic people are not smart

01:49:47.159 --> 01:49:48.600
enough

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.760
um and so then I got dead cat theorem

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:53.040
and somebody said Return to the source

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.860
and with this beautiful thing and then I

01:49:55.860 --> 01:50:00.020
thought and this was the insight

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:04.139
one hand clapping there's we need to

01:50:04.139 --> 01:50:05.940
answer this question we have to get

01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.360
Beyond The Duality of life in debt and I

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.100
started to say what if the origin is

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:13.739
something much more like death

01:50:13.739 --> 01:50:15.300
see this is what we always start with

01:50:15.300 --> 01:50:18.000
things like the seed and the wooji and

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.800
the Egg we always start with something

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.900
that's living but what if we could

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:25.260
understand it this is why we don't have

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:28.199
understand origin because it's it's got

01:50:28.199 --> 01:50:31.380
to have a lot more of what death is in

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:34.020
it because what we know for sure is that

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:36.420
all life comes from death

01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:39.480
this was a huge insight to see like how

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:42.239
you the practice that you I participated

01:50:42.239 --> 01:50:45.300
in with you just shifted something so

01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.060
fundamental in every way we

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:51.540
asked this question that's even my work

01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:53.820
so this is collective Insight practice

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:56.940
there's something that is so you look

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:59.699
around and uh and I think this is when

01:50:59.699 --> 01:51:02.280
Sandra said looking at this is it's kind

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.960
of like

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:06.239
the answer is right here because we're

01:51:06.239 --> 01:51:08.760
just asking like what is reality and and

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.340
if it could only

01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:13.199
were constrained through these epistemic

01:51:13.199 --> 01:51:15.900
constraints so for me this was

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:18.000
um um and I know it's a lot it's hard

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.159
work for people

01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:22.260
um and especially if you're starting but

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:25.199
there it is productive it is very

01:51:25.199 --> 01:51:27.600
Collective and I think I worked on this

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.040
thing for months

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.300
and only in this instance was some kind

01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:35.940
of this kind of insight telescopic might

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.860
be also because there's something about

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.320
it we don't have to if it doesn't ever

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.719
come up again we don't know but um

01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:45.659
that's what Collective Insight practice

01:51:45.659 --> 01:51:50.760
is about you get surprised Magdalena

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.639
you can just call me mad I've earned it

01:51:56.639 --> 01:51:59.699
um anyway

01:51:59.699 --> 01:52:01.380
um it's amazing you brought this up

01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:03.840
because what I what came to me

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:06.659
afterwards in the breakout room but I

01:52:06.659 --> 01:52:08.219
didn't want to get into it and I won't

01:52:08.219 --> 01:52:10.560
get into it now but I'm sure you know

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.219
the the the the the piran now you know

01:52:14.219 --> 01:52:18.239
the the don't sleep there's snakes that

01:52:18.239 --> 01:52:20.880
whole thing that turned universal

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:24.780
language of Chomsky all upside down

01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:27.719
and it was with this tribe in the Amazon

01:52:27.719 --> 01:52:30.000
that

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.080
um basically because their environment

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.300
is basically a Russian roulette with

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:40.139
doubt I mean there's just insects snakes

01:52:40.139 --> 01:52:44.460
uh anything can kill you at any time

01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:46.080
so there's no

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:48.119
recursivity

01:52:48.119 --> 01:52:51.739
in their language at all none

01:52:51.739 --> 01:52:56.460
and so this this this even in the way

01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:59.520
the the greedy tradition is like don't

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.980
sleep their snakes I mean

01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:05.940
and so in analyzing that language for

01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.020
example

01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:09.060
you know there's no yesterday or

01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:10.199
tomorrow

01:53:10.199 --> 01:53:13.440
there's no quantities no numbers there's

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.380
just a little or a lot yeah

01:53:16.380 --> 01:53:19.980
um and there's also

01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.119
um

01:53:21.119 --> 01:53:23.159
you know

01:53:23.159 --> 01:53:25.199
that's what

01:53:25.199 --> 01:53:27.920
I just vibrated would you talk about

01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:31.560
with death you know death is so email

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:35.219
right you know it's not like because to

01:53:35.219 --> 01:53:37.320
start with death is just starting with

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:40.020
the other side of the other hand but

01:53:40.020 --> 01:53:43.100
there's something about

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:45.780
this constraint

01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:48.420
that we're always trying to justify even

01:53:48.420 --> 01:53:52.560
me that matters animistic and living

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.540
uh because how can you get like you know

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:57.659
what I'm saying it's it's just yeah

01:53:57.659 --> 01:53:59.820
let's just hold on to it we don't over

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:03.800
analyze it yeah Sandra yet

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:07.139
so at the very end of our breakout

01:54:07.139 --> 01:54:09.719
Schultz said something to the effect

01:54:09.719 --> 01:54:10.880
that

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:14.820
he kept this pattern of amplification

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.860
going

01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:19.699
and

01:54:19.699 --> 01:54:22.560
that sparked for me well maybe that's

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.900
the origin of the universe

01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:28.380
but what I kept coming up against in the

01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:33.560
imagery during our Collective time was

01:54:35.239 --> 01:54:37.920
interdependent color Rising I mean

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:39.960
that's not the words that were there but

01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:43.820
that's kind of how it translates

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:49.199
and the not Tunis of it like how do we

01:54:49.199 --> 01:54:51.300
how do we work with the one hand how do

01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:55.199
we work with the ah yeah so it's not

01:54:55.199 --> 01:54:57.600
that oh death has been there from the

01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.880
beginning is what we're saying it's it's

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:03.199
and and

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:10.380
yeah we and and that's part of the story

01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:12.360
and you know life has been there from

01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.280
the beginning let's say but that and

01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:15.719
then there's something richer than that

01:55:15.719 --> 01:55:17.820
because this is still within that that

01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:22.440
framework yeah JJ

01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:25.500
uh something that came through towards

01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:27.540
the end of our breakout session

01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.580
um we'd kind of all been bouncing of

01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:31.980
each other and then uh what came up in

01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:34.860
me was a persistent origin

01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:36.600
and again like kind of think about okay

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:38.880
not looking at origin as this thing this

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:42.600
started over there but that is yeah it's

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.580
the continuity and like the Persistence

01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:46.560
of it and when you're talking about sort

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.420
of death in that way as well like it

01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:51.540
that just really resonated with that

01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:53.460
um yeah that just came through quite

01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:56.280
strong then yeah every things were dying

01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.980
in being born from the death ever since

01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:00.600
the beginning something like that like

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.480
some yeah okay so this is a little over

01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:05.520
time does anybody else have something to

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:08.100
say can you see the inside practice in

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:09.600
this

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.980
um

01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.679
um there I have a see but it's ever

01:56:13.679 --> 01:56:15.960
present death isn't it like when we say

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.300
of a present origin that my my mental

01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:21.179
model immediately goes to Life's Source

01:56:21.179 --> 01:56:23.639
returns return return to the source

01:56:23.639 --> 01:56:26.659
she literally this dead cat

01:56:26.659 --> 01:56:29.820
returned to the source we wrapped her in

01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.260
something that said flowing to the

01:56:31.260 --> 01:56:33.840
source it was literally that is the

01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:38.760
source she's dead like like this

01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:40.860
it's weird

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:44.639
go ahead Katie

01:56:44.639 --> 01:56:46.800
um I just I wanted to share this since

01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:48.900
or a question whether I should share

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.460
since the kind of like the beginning of

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:52.800
this topic but I like I personally have

01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:53.639
a

01:56:53.639 --> 01:56:56.159
Like An Origin story that kind of meets

01:56:56.159 --> 01:56:57.900
the criteria at least at least for me

01:56:57.900 --> 01:57:01.080
that I believe in I'm able to believe in

01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.400
fully

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:03.420
um and it was something that like

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:05.420
arrived through one of these like crazy

01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:08.699
like anxiety experiences

01:57:08.699 --> 01:57:12.060
um it's not fully articulable in words

01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:15.020
but I don't know if I

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:17.340
like it might be good to talk about it

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.020
sometime or like try to write it down or

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.420
something like that it's kind of felt

01:57:21.420 --> 01:57:23.580
like a

01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:24.840
um

01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.739
the evolution of the ability to to to

01:57:27.739 --> 01:57:31.320
regenerate and like

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:34.739
yeah like recursivity over Through Time

01:57:34.739 --> 01:57:37.679
yeah so this is another interesting

01:57:37.679 --> 01:57:42.139
question what what is something

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:46.400
one hand clapping

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:49.940
that dies

01:57:50.159 --> 01:57:53.460
itself dies and is born and it can't be

01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:56.280
like temporal like the Phoenix it's like

01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:01.980
the whole thing yeah the whole thing uh

01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:04.619
this is very fascinating this is very

01:58:04.619 --> 01:58:08.460
fascinating uh yeah it's basically this

01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:10.199
kind of idea that

01:58:10.199 --> 01:58:12.119
um

01:58:12.119 --> 01:58:14.580
like

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:16.260
like we we think about like not

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.940
Evolution and natural selection like

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:20.099
things that are that are able to to

01:58:20.099 --> 01:58:21.599
survive in their environment are then

01:58:21.599 --> 01:58:23.460
able to survive and reproduce so we see

01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:26.280
more of them in reality

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.840
um but like the rude idea is kind of

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.179
something more like things that are able

01:58:30.179 --> 01:58:31.679
to exist

01:58:31.679 --> 01:58:34.619
are able to exist and they're kind of

01:58:34.619 --> 01:58:36.420
like strategies that are able to exist

01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:38.099
more

01:58:38.099 --> 01:58:41.159
um like more in reality in space-time so

01:58:41.159 --> 01:58:42.480
like you can

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.340
and like one way

01:58:44.340 --> 01:58:46.020
one way is literally just to be able to

01:58:46.020 --> 01:58:47.639
take form and then another way is to be

01:58:47.639 --> 01:58:50.340
able to take form that is stable and can

01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.320
persist over time one way to exist more

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.239
is like to be able to

01:58:54.239 --> 01:58:56.639
like be physically larger and then to

01:58:56.639 --> 01:58:59.099
like regenerate copies of yourself

01:58:59.099 --> 01:59:00.599
um but those copies have to be somewhat

01:59:00.599 --> 01:59:02.820
flexible as the environment changes so

01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:03.960
that you can morph yourself but

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.219
basically like this process like

01:59:05.219 --> 01:59:09.199
building it's up itself up into

01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:11.820
like the the thing that ultimately would

01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:14.699
be the most able to exist in reality

01:59:14.699 --> 01:59:17.520
would be the thing that can

01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.980
can evolve in order to yeah like

01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:22.320
regenerate itself as it dies in a way so

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.179
that it's existed all the way from the

01:59:24.179 --> 01:59:26.400
beginning it would just pervade it from

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:27.119
that

01:59:27.119 --> 01:59:29.880
Eternal yeah Eternal so you have like a

01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:31.860
future causing the past kind of thing as

01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:35.219
it's learned how to become yeah through

01:59:35.219 --> 01:59:36.960
an evolutionary process this thing that

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.659
can be eternal yeah

01:59:39.659 --> 01:59:43.260
that's like JJ's persistence

01:59:43.260 --> 01:59:46.380
um yeah all right this is great this is

01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:47.520
this is

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:49.739
this is how

01:59:49.739 --> 01:59:52.699
it happens

01:59:52.739 --> 01:59:54.780
so pay attention to like what the

01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:56.099
universe

01:59:56.099 --> 02:00:00.060
uh might add uh to the conversation it's

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:03.619
not a conversation sorry

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:08.580
thank you very much for uh yeah for uh

02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:13.340
playing this this game game with me



## Cohort 2

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
foreign

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.420
that big smile Sam has on his face

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.980
just want to uh welcome Ellen

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.840
who is a soul that I know

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.700
um

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.480
so I'll give a little introduction to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.160
um I'm not sure if

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.200
you've had time to watch any of the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
content or anything Ellen

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.399
um but this is the start of a new thing

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
and it's a strange thing so it's it's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.480
strange to all of us uh so it's a it's a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.620
good place to start

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.840
and that is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
um we've been trying to compose a new

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.619
theory of the body

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.479
and in this second uh part of the year

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.200
um we're into origin stories

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260
um

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
and so this week we are thinking of

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.460
[Music]

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.240
um

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.759
the origins of the body but our word

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.119
body means all kinds of bodies like a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.060
planetary body where an electron is a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.360
body or a tree is a body

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.979
or

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.439
and we're dealing with this notion of my

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.240
body as Bonnie is a is compounded from

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.920
organisms which are also bodies so this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.619
is the compound individual

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.200
but we can also then extend this notion

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.520
of body

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.820
to a human Collective a collective of

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.100
compound individuals

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.619
then what's the difference between a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.020
collective a society a compound

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.360
individual or is it a collective of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.459
compound individuals

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.700
so these are what I would call some of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.099
the epistemic constraints that we're

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.000
dealing with when we talk about a body

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.739
and we just know notice notice that

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.739
um

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.379
and some of those Concepts that I just

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.520
said might uh come into play

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.500
again

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
um

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.959
is the planet Earth because it has a

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.900
biosphere a compound individual

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.739
um but Mars is not or is the the solar

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.260
system a collective

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.959
of forces

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.920
inanimate planets

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.959
or is it a compound individual these are

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.360
these are interesting questions

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.959
um

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.480
we don't ask them because we want to

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.019
torture ourselves or come up with some

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.680
historical and novel meta Theory we

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.940
asked them because we want to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.700
investigate meaning at a human level at

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.800
a deep human level

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.319
and also

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.319
noticing that regardless of what culture

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.500
you're in and regardless of whether your

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.280
parents ever sat you down or you went to

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.060
a church or a set saying and people told

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.120
you an origin story we hold origin

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.760
stories in our

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.180
in our meaning making system as human

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.540
beings so there's always an origin story

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.799
um in in to one extent or another

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.920
um so we're this is what we're

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.900
investigating

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.180
um and we do hope to come up with an

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.120
artifact that's useful and helpful in

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.879
the in this along this along these lines

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.220
okay does everybody understand where

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.959
we're at

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:13.920
um

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.979
now the interesting thing about asking

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.600
questions like this is that they're

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.380
unfathomably difficult to answer but

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.960
because they involve

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.020
the very essence of Being Human anyone

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.600
can think about them right there's no

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.600
like special expertise in asking

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.680
yourselves

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.380
where did I come from

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.660
what's the original face of the universe

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.800
or any of these these these questions

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.500
um so at the one hand they're they're

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
completely unfathomable and at the other

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.699
hand every human being has a direct

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.139
access

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.759
to answering this question

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.139
um now

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.840
what we're doing is we're practicing

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.100
Collective Insight practice or trying to

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.020
in a kind of uh very down and dirty way

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.580
um because we all know each other pretty

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.139
well and

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.080
I didn't want to

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.220
waste any time supporting the process so

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.759
um let's look at what the methodology is

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.740
and then I'll open it up to some

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.960
questions about the methodology for

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.479
those of you who jumped into it last

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.860
time

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.160
um and and this is the methodology of

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.479
collective Insight practice

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.280
it's extremely

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.539
um

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.039
important to understand that

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.400
we can that when we contemplate

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.139
questions like this we're looking for

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.340
insight

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.280
and insight comes through the body we

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.220
need to think with our bodies not think

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.419
about our bodies Okay so

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.240
um what do I mean by that we talked

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.479
about how children when they're young

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.060
they get hunches about how the world

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.380
works

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.539
they don't get these hunches because

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.940
they formulate sentences in their head

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.280
and then think about it and get a theory

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.979
and then write it down they just their

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.800
body works out

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.419
extraordinarily complex things like how

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.919
to speak

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.240
and how to put syntax together and uh

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.699
what what is more there's four pencils

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.199
over here and there's two pencils over

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.080
here and they figure out laws of

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.180
causality about self other and World

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.940
they figure out that they can move

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.400
people at a distance but they don't

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.280
figure any of this out by constructing

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.759
thoughts and words in their heads

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.360
zero zero

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.479
and the reality is this level of

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:03.240
thinking cognizing

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.039
is then proven from neuroscience

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:10.860
to proceed at a rate that has much more

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.620
power than the

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.139
part of your brain that thinks and

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.139
thoughts so there's something like a

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.380
hundred million bits per second of

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.020
processing information in your body and

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.720
the and your thinking when you think of

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.880
it with words in your head you get about

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.520
14 to 64 bits of information

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.599
okay so it's very important that what

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:42.720
we're doing is something strange because

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.940
you might not think you you're thinking

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.360
at all

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.639
okay so what does it feel like to think

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.259
with your body

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.660
now sometimes in your life

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.699
something impacts you and you've thought

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.139
of it this way you thought of it that

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.300
way and you find yourself you're just

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.000
stunned by the question you ever feel

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.280
like that like you just sit there and

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.319
you're stunned by the question the

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.660
question has grabbed you

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.940
but you don't have any thoughts you're

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.080
stunned by the question

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:21.840
but something's happening in you also

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.160
you know

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.759
um

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:25.979
I don't get into that but something is

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.319
happening something is it's not

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.740
emotional content it's a

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:37.979
single-minded focusness of the body and

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:41.459
that your brain and your

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:44.039
mind that thinks it thoughts doesn't it

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.740
doesn't have privy to

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.680
he doesn't have privy too

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.519
um and this is how

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.580
um

00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:00.300
the Insight practice happens so what are

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.880
we doing what what are we we're thinking

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.940
with our body thinking through our body

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.920
not with our body like here's us and

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.839
here's our body we're thinking through

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:13.160
our body and our bodies in communication

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.339
with the world the worlding of it of

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:18.420
everything

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.740
the body's remembering

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.160
how nose has a remembrance of how

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.860
complex things get worked out and we

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.200
want to run this question which is quite

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.800
conceptual through those processes of

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.220
the body

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.760
now as we do this there are certain

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.560
techniques that if you're new at this

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.500
you have to use certain uh like training

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.660
wheels I would say

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.839
like I write all this course content I

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:56.279
think about it you know when I come in

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:58.260
and I said I'm thinking about it all all

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.980
week like I don't think about it I just

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.580
it's it's consuming me it's metabolizing

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.779
in me

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:09.300
and then all of a sudden usually I call

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.040
my elves I wake up in the middle of the

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.500
night and it's just a download and I

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.899
just write out the content okay and this

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:17.640
is something that's fascinated me since

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.560
I was in college and I've told you this

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.660
story I'm just gonna ramble a little to

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.700
give people reason to believe that this

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.800
crazy thing we're doing is real

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.339
and that is I would study try to study

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:30.899
for physics this was before we had

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.940
computers and I would fall asleep in the

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.959
cubicles and not be able to do my

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:39.300
homework but I couldn't do the the

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.420
exercise test exercise test

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.579
and then I would get up and I'd go and

00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.560
to make the one and fall asleep and in

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.540
the middle of the night

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.399
I would know the answer

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.440
and I think

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.560
like how did that happen and this was

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.820
like 50 years ago or 40 years ago and

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.880
ever since then I've been studying from

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.700
a first person perspective like what

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.899
happens

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:09.180
when that's happening and I've gotten

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.839
really lazy like before I do a re like a

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.300
retreat or a conference I just set an

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.060
intention before I go to bed

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.140
and then I'm like okay easy for me I

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.060
don't have to think about it I mean

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.820
there's something you know Neuroscience

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.540
also uh has a lot to say about this but

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.760
you can get extremely

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.540
uh confident in

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.180
um thinking through through the body now

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.920
we all know this is true when you play

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.899
sports that thinking while you're

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:45.600
playing sports is not helpful

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.000
we also know for example if I'm doing

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.240
yoga and I'm stretching out my left calf

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.860
muscle

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.560
um it does no good for me to try to

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.660
explain to the muscles oh you just have

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.480
to move some of that tannic acid out you

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.320
know it does it does no good for me to

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.420
approach the problem that way what it

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.300
What is helpful is for me to say to the

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.220
body you know how to do it you know how

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.740
to do it I have no clue so now we're

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.480
talking about like the level of a

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.100
compound individual the compound

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.380
individual saying I don't have cognitive

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.380
access to what you do when I give you a

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.640
problem

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.560
yeah

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.200
um and the nature of the mind is the

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.040
body will serve up then the answer to

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.700
the mind uh when it has something

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.320
now

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.360
training wheels one is that when when as

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.100
I said in the last

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.560
um session the first session Collective

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.040
Insight practice is not dialogic but

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.279
we're not talking to each other

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:56.700
where our bodies are talking to the

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.880
world

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.839
um but we want we will share things

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.000
occasionally

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.779
things that seem surprising to have a

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:11.579
certain mark

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.279
um like last time someone got fascinated

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:18.240
with the word teleoscope

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.279
and it was an interesting word it was

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.200
different so something was percolating

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.980
in him that had this label teleoscope

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.220
and we also talked about

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.660
necrogenesis last time

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.480
so some of these things are interesting

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.540
we don't want to clamp down on them they

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.380
are

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.600
certain spices that have been put in the

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.060
stew some things have energy and will

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.800
last to the last session and someone

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.980
won't have that much energy some are

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.639
peripheral okay so what it's not

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:54.540
dialogic but what happens is

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.300
we want to

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.279
um release

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:02.279
the when when we're trying to think

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:04.560
through our bodies

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.839
um

00:14:05.839 --> 00:14:09.300
people who are not used to this the body

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.779
will start to you start to release that

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.120
energy by creating sentences in your

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:15.839
head

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:21.060
and so the way to release that slowly is

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.760
to not let the sentences build up in

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.700
your head as whole sentences certainly

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.680
not as whole paragraphs

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.839
right and this is what we usually do we

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.820
get oh we're in practice and then we

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.180
start and we're compo okay and the way

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.380
you want to do that is you want to agree

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.139
it's a contract amongst us is as soon as

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:44.399
a word

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:46.980
starts to presence itself in your head

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.320
you're gonna say it

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.660
don't get so far that it's a whole

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.220
sentence if you're saying whole

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.620
sentences you're not paying attention

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.639
enough

00:14:56.639 --> 00:14:59.959
you want to speak the very first word

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:03.240
because the vigilance in letting the

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.279
first word go

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:08.639
create a stop if you speak the first

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.220
word the net many of the next ones won't

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.720
come

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.339
so

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:17.579
if you're speaking whole sentences then

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:21.660
that means the whole thing has

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.279
come

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.560
got it gotten ahead of you so you want

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.420
to be very vigilant

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.680
as soon as a word a thought thing in

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.980
your head comes you want to speak it

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.560
so some people were a little confused

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.600
last time and so I'm sitting here

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.380
talking about Origins and I hear my head

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.120
say

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.680
this

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.620
okay that if if I did it right that's

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.959
all I would have to do I just did it

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.279
right I couldn't remember what I was

00:15:53.279 --> 00:15:55.139
going to say but if I let it come be

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:57.600
like this can't be the right thing I can

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.500
I'm supposed to say it doesn't matter if

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.680
it's if you it doesn't matter the form

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.380
of what's coming out if you caught it at

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.279
this

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:11.160
then it's perfect so you want to make

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.040
sure you speak every word that is

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.839
composed in your head

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:18.480
if it comes out as a word as a thought

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.440
thing

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.680
as an inner talk you want to speak it

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.779
but you don't want to speak it and then

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:26.459
let it continue you know what I'm saying

00:16:26.459 --> 00:16:28.920
you want to get it right as it presents

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.279
itself

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.920
first maybe three words will come or

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.500
whole sentences then one word and then

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.300
you can catch the words before they

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.639
actually come

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:44.399
now as you do this process what you're

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:47.399
doing is you're training your body to

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:50.339
say no it's not the usual thing like

00:16:50.339 --> 00:16:52.320
when I ask a question and then I want

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.300
you to pour all these thought things in

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.779
my head I want to be patient and have

00:16:57.779 --> 00:17:01.860
you think through this for me

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.959
um and so that builds up energy in the

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:08.400
body and for novices that energy usually

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.819
takes a habituated form

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.419
so what might happen is

00:17:15.419 --> 00:17:18.720
it's that you might feel frustrated or

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.079
you might feel this is stupid or you

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.540
might feel

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.079
um angry or you might feel combative or

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:29.280
whatever

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.120
and those might turn into little thought

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.220
things in your head which you would have

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.960
to speak

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.220
um but do not be surprised if your body

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.480
starts taking on a habit uh because if

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.520
you're a novice that's what it does so

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.160
we're we're not letting it release this

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.980
energy into like blah blah blah so

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.679
what's cultivating energy in the body

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:59.100
and if you're a novice it it only knows

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.500
you know is it

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.580
it'll follow a bunch of things it's

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.360
always done and then that's okay we

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.820
that's that's just your body being

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.020
trained eventually none of those work

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.400
you didn't talk about them you didn't

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.580
care about them none of those work and

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.340
then the body remembers that it has a

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.480
natural intelligence

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.760
so that's their that's the basic

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.100
methodology

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.320
and the we're going to ask the body to

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.900
be in service of

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.679
um

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:38.480
helping us out like

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.160
where did we come from where did this

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.559
reality come from what is the essence

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:46.260
when I say

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.600
um speak from source which a lot of

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.280
people in this community what what is

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.100
Source what is the source what is like

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.080
what is that we want to have a very

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.380
strong Insight around these things

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.960
and were were

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.919
you know uh Ian mcgilchrist says uh the

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:07.980
mind is a great servant

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.679
but the body is the master is its master

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:15.419
so we want them body uh the mind to be

00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.760
in service to the body

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.799
um by waiting and being patient and

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:22.919
understanding acknowledging uh its

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:25.940
epistemic limitations

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:30.380
does that make sense

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.299
are there any questions about the

00:19:33.299 --> 00:19:35.039
methodology

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:37.740
first or comments if somebody did it

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.660
last time and

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.580
can shed some light

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.100
no no light here but

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.740
um

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.740
uh I I it did happen the last time

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.900
and I wasn't sure what to do in that

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.100
kind of interrupted things

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.660
that sometimes

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.419
the words came in another language

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.360
you just speaking

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.020
I translate I translate it

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.480
oh I would just speak them as they come

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.640
out in in the language it is because

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.919
you're not you're you're we're training

00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:22.700
our bodies and also

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.260
it's not probably not coincidence that

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.240
the body wants to morph into a different

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.880
language the body is it's kind of like

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.419
when you're getting a massage and you go

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:36.000
like you go with it you you because your

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.620
shoulder hurts they work on that and

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.780
then it's your hip and then it said this

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.120
and then it said that and this is the

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.280
same kind of thing your body's doing as

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.059
it's trying to work work out of these

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:52.620
habits and it knows it knows

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.440
what's a what's a it knows what's a good

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.760
sequence

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.059
so when you switch language

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:02.580
you know just if you can just as it

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.080
comes in a different language sometimes

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.299
it's just baby talk some you some people

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:08.760
have baby talk you know

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.640
um as as the whole

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.960
body to body to language

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.700
thing starts to decouple

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.860
we're not after you know we have this

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.919
question we're not after an answer like

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:28.919
one and done or more at the phase of

00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:32.159
practicing the methodology

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.620
um what you can

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.400
um so what I want you to start first is

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.120
um just presence this question like

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:48.320
how the heck did we get here or what is

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.419
where did we come from or how did the

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:53.419
world come from or

00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:58.280
any any anything that

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.799
is your particular perspective into this

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:07.220
question

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:11.400
so Bonnie last time I noticed

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.500
um you know this word insight and I was

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.419
noticing a lot of people had their eyes

00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:17.520
closed but my body was preferring to

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.520
kind of keep the eyes open and I imagine

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.039
that there's probably maybe even a

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.500
different response like the body

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.940
I'm wondering if you've noticed

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.159
differences in maybe what comes alive

00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:31.919
with eyes open versus eyes closed it's a

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:33.980
good

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.900
uh a lot of people

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.740
um

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.520
if if it's difficult them to be vigilant

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.159
about the words they they keep their

00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:46.140
eyes closed because they're actually

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.480
watching really carefully

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.360
if the words are coming

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.620
um if if that's

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.740
um

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.140
but we also talked about I think Marie

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.240
was outside when she did it last time

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.140
and she noticed that she could

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.260
interested in a bird let's say again

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.080
this is the this is not

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.159
um

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:16.559
necessarily just random

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:19.380
the body will look at different things

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.440
and it's part of it

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.500
red it's looking at Red I don't have any

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.100
words but it's settled there around this

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.760
question and then it'll move on and so

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.120
there is a certain way of keeping your

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.480
eyes open and noticing

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.600
it may be a sound all of a sudden that

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.179
your folk that the body focuses on and

00:23:45.179 --> 00:23:50.120
then it might move to the breeze

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.940
these are

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.700
the way the these are not we can talk

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.500
about it later about

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.600
how I learned this in shinsen Young's

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.820
retreat but these are not

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.140
uh random

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.400
the body is is

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:14.659
taking things from the world

00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:20.960
it's it's like when we saw

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.500
um Cheryl gets got completely absorbed

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.179
in the Taurus

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:33.679
why why why and so you get these little

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.460
things that are in the world that are

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.559
part of the answer the truth is

00:24:40.559 --> 00:24:42.960
everything in the world is part of the

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.820
answer because the question is so big

00:24:47.039 --> 00:24:49.860
and so when your eyes are open you might

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.700
find yourself

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.860
moving from different mode of perception

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.200
to other modes of perception

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.080
and if you're an advanced practitioner

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.480
you find that that has a pattern it's

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:09.600
not random it's an Insight pattern uh so

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.679
um

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:12.840
yeah did that answer your question

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.500
but a lot of times if you're doing that

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.679
you'll find oh I've been making a whole

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.860
sentence in my head uh so maybe I need

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.179
to be more Vigilant about uh

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:31.020
watching watching my my thought stream

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.059
start

00:25:33.059 --> 00:25:35.400
um so it goes back and forth there's no

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.799
right or wrong we're all practicing at

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:40.799
this at this point okay so what we do is

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:45.260
we unmute and I'm going to mute

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.880
um

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.779
and

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:52.500
um you don't have to speak your words

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.900
loudly but you have to speak them or

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.740
else they just say words in your head

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.600
um and

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.380
um we're going to do this for

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.640
um

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.580
we did it for 45 minutes last time and

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.740
let's do it for 45 minutes this time

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.260
some people thought it was too short

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:18.779
um it does get can be can be hard uh for

00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:20.400
for new people we'll do it for 45

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.740
minutes and let me say this there is

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.260
times when people laugh things get funny

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.600
the energy shifts a little

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.960
um and we just try try to

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.600
um reconnect with the question when that

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.940
happens because the collective itself

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.940
sometimes needs like

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.279
to take take a little break

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:46.520
um so all of these things are fine

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.039
okay just do the instruction you don't

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:52.260
have to then go meta and try to figure

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.880
out what's happening in the collective

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.799
yet I will

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:58.860
um reflect some of that back to you

00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.700

um

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.419

00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:10.799
and

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.000

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:32.780

01:15:59.159 --> 01:16:01.440
at the same time the

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.040
the pain of that

that even made me cry more

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.120

yeah they both are salt water and

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.760
I guess this is

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.340
you know statistically but

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.360
um

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.540
I can I can see the faces when I hear

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:26.219
the voices

01:17:26.219 --> 01:17:28.020

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.980
this

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:43.320
is thinking

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.060
you know

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:48.060
if

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.080
one of you died

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.140
you know what could I do

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:56.400
you know

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.780
in the this distance

01:18:01.739 --> 01:18:04.800
and yet I wouldn't want that

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.880
to keep me from

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:15.199
not having met you or worked with you

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.460
okay

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.600
now I'm probably gonna start laughing

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.159
because this is outrageous

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.120

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:32.719
you know what

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:35.100
look right then

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.219
um

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.460
what do they do

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.100
oh

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.739
seriously Bonita

01:18:46.739 --> 01:18:48.860
um

01:18:50.699 --> 01:18:53.400
all this work you've been doing all

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.679
these years

01:18:55.679 --> 01:18:58.199
and you know I'm on this other parallel

01:18:58.199 --> 01:19:00.600
thing with the conviviality and all the

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.860
reading

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:08.219
that you've put on our convivial table

01:19:08.219 --> 01:19:11.820
so this is all intense okay

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.320
but

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.460
I wouldn't trade it for nothing so thank

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:19.020
you

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:24.500

01:19:32.159 --> 01:19:34.820
enough

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:40.800
let me share us about the experience it

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.120
was a little different this time

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.580
I want to say better but

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:53.179
uh

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.699
my body feels like it's a fuse or a

01:20:14.699 --> 01:20:16.980
circuit right now that was just uh

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:18.840
getting a lot of current for a while

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.440
it's like needing to cool down

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.460
um

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.380
the one thing if I were to try to

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.420
describe that it was it felt like being

01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.760
on a spiral current that was cycling

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.300
around common phonemes and there would

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:36.659
be these phonic Roots uh that would

01:20:36.659 --> 01:20:39.900
recur almost it almost felt cyclical and

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.640
I could feel the way that the words that

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.040
were coming through were like

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.260
modulations of these seed syllables

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.800
almost but then certain forms would take

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.239
whole like certain particular words

01:20:51.239 --> 01:20:53.040
would take hold multiple times for me

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.140
and I noticed they'd come out multiple

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:56.159
times

01:20:56.159 --> 01:20:57.900
I could also notice where the where the

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:58.800
mines

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.480
the mind is kind of registering what's

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.920
being said and even the part that's like

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.540
oh like maybe I'll say that or I could

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.280
Riff on that you know and just kind of

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.100
letting that be there but really trying

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:09.620
to like

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.659
feel the where the body's speaking in a

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:14.520
kind of un unprethought

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.360
um

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.640
way yeah

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.679
so if you see the difference when you're

01:21:19.679 --> 01:21:22.080
caught up in the trigger of conversation

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.600
or proto-conversation

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.179
so you're trying to riff off of what

01:21:27.179 --> 01:21:28.800
just happened there's a different

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.699
biomarker between that and when actually

01:21:32.699 --> 01:21:35.520
for some reason the body serves up

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.560
something

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.980
um yeah so noticing

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.100
the veil to detect the differences isn't

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.199
is important

01:21:46.199 --> 01:21:50.840
um it was much more less

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.440
um

01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.719
what there was a lot less pinging today

01:21:57.719 --> 01:22:00.300
than there was the first time there was

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.980
more you could tell people were just

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.400
releasing what they had versus ah I hear

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.640
that and then and that happens sometimes

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:12.179
um and that was something that I noticed

01:22:12.179 --> 01:22:14.400
as a collective and you can also notice

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:18.300
in yourself whether you're pinging or

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.600
what whatever's coming up is whatever is

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.800
coming up for whatever reason

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:30.360
yeah I noticed that as well the

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.420
yeah it was like less of the bouncing

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:37.880
off of us but there was a point when um

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:40.260
yeah that was kind of just like a few

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.000
moments where

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.280
because I I was about to say something

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.400
and then it got said and that happened a

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.900
few times and then I started thinking

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:50.340
about it too much and they kind of fell

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.739
out of it

01:22:52.739 --> 01:22:53.880
um

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.560
yeah and then there was a point actually

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.140
I just I yeah I just felt like actually

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.239
I needed to leave her a bit and so I did

01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:02.219
and then I wasn't sure if I was going to

01:23:02.219 --> 01:23:04.260
come back in

01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:07.560
and kind of just sat for a while

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.000
um but then yeah okay all right

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.920
so that's a problem sometimes you end up

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:17.159
getting sucked into an Insight that is

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:20.100
yours and you can't play this game

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.620
anymore and you just whether you're

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.560
it's got you right it's because at first

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.659
all the insights are not just Collective

01:23:27.659 --> 01:23:31.219
at first they're actually

01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:34.440
they they unfold from the collective

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:36.060
experience but sometimes you just get

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:38.280
gra you get grabbed by an Insight like

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.719
you're like

01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:42.480
um so that's I I would say

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:44.540
um

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.800
is the right the right quote-unquote

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.140
thing to do when you just have to like

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:52.380
stare at your own insight for a while

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:55.500
um uh

01:23:57.179 --> 01:23:59.040
I was gonna say something else but I

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.400
don't remember so

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:07.340
I can share Bonnie um

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:10.620
I noticed a difference personally

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:12.840
between the first time I did it in this

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:15.420
large group and this time

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:19.500
first time I was really rebellious about

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:22.560
the notion that words didn't matter

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.440
I had a lot of

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.179
um

01:24:27.179 --> 01:24:31.739
fight going on with that instruction

01:24:31.739 --> 01:24:34.620
and this time

01:24:34.620 --> 01:24:38.460
there was an equal amount of energetic

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:40.320
tension I had

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.860
and it was different in that I was

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:46.679
tense about finding something that's

01:24:46.679 --> 01:24:49.739
abstract that's not there

01:24:49.739 --> 01:24:53.280
so I kept it was this visit I mean my

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.400
shoulders my neck

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.600
in that search

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:03.300
yeah so that yeah that was your portal

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.820
today I mean

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:08.100
um let me say this I

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.260
and later phases the words will matter

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.140
because we'll get very precise at this

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:13.920
phase

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.960
because we don't want to clamp down so

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.320
fast right but actually you know the

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.440
energy for that frustration is also some

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.679
of the energy the body uses so so that's

01:25:25.679 --> 01:25:28.679
okay too did anyone like what was

01:25:28.679 --> 01:25:32.400
happening to me I I also had like some

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.620
insights but like there's a point at

01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.600
which in some of you may have been doing

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.440
this um

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.800
where you're relaxed and these words are

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.520
coming in and you're actually

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.040
experiencing them as

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.320
that words are come your words are

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.120
coming into your head but they're not

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.739
your words they're what everybody else

01:25:55.739 --> 01:25:59.340
is saying like you can receive them just

01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:02.340
like you're receiving your own words all

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.139
right here comes a word

01:26:04.139 --> 01:26:06.960
uh you can completely relax your mind

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.900
and then these words come into your head

01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:12.960
but the interesting thing is is it's not

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.699
your pattern

01:26:14.699 --> 01:26:16.980
because they're coming in from all

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:20.219
disparate the collective pattern and as

01:26:20.219 --> 01:26:22.199
they come in and

01:26:22.199 --> 01:26:24.120
it's like you think that's your head

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.120
doing that then it's changing it's

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.820
rearranging your yourself in a certain

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:32.040
way

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.679
um and so you you can go in and out of

01:26:34.679 --> 01:26:38.219
like realizing you've just been

01:26:38.219 --> 01:26:40.860
witnessing these words in your head as

01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.659
if there were words that were coming

01:26:42.659 --> 01:26:46.880
into your head from your experience

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.520
did anyone have that feeling like in

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.300
certain phases

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.739
I most certainly did

01:26:58.739 --> 01:27:01.380
yeah because it happens when your words

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:04.020
stop and then you realize

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:06.420
why should I generate words here's a

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:08.520
whole group doing

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.460
a multiple

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.780
diversity of

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:15.120
word generation what's that all about

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.139
that's interesting

01:27:20.159 --> 01:27:24.620
yeah but it was painful too

01:27:25.199 --> 01:27:27.800
and

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:31.739
I don't ascribe any negativity to that

01:27:31.739 --> 01:27:33.980
pain

01:27:38.159 --> 01:27:39.719
or

01:27:39.719 --> 01:27:43.080
maybe what occurs to me to say is almost

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.000
like

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.880
you know

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.159
listening to the dark matter you know

01:27:50.159 --> 01:27:53.159
somehow

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.179
Susan did you want to say something at

01:28:00.179 --> 01:28:03.659
one point it was too many words coming

01:28:03.659 --> 01:28:04.860
in

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:07.020
I just was

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:10.739
I I don't know what I did or but it just

01:28:10.739 --> 01:28:13.620
felt so many words coming in

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:16.739
and I probably I wasn't speaking

01:28:16.739 --> 01:28:17.940
then

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:21.000
no I wasn't like I didn't have words

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.219
coming but words coming in from

01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:24.780
everywhere

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.780
and it felt yeah it did it felt too much

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:30.420
I mean from what other people were

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.540
speaking or inside your oh yeah no no no

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.900
no no inside me from All Wood I was

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:40.739
hearing like too much coming in and yeah

01:28:40.739 --> 01:28:42.540
you should yeah you should have tried to

01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.460
speak them

01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.620
speak the words that were coming in from

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:49.620
others oh no no no okay so they were

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:53.040
coming from others and it was too much

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:56.760
yeah yeah okay yeah because you get

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.560
trained in your mind

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.239
it was

01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:03.360
yeah I I understand why yeah okay

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.400
no you don't have you don't speak the

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.580
words that come in from others but yeah

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:09.260
yeah

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.540
the other thing as well that is

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.820
happening still happening

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:16.679
is

01:29:16.679 --> 01:29:19.620
I'm not quite sure where I am I I don't

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:21.840
mean that in a silly way like of course

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:24.480
I know where I am but I don't

01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:27.719
really know where I am

01:29:27.719 --> 01:29:30.659
okay so two two big things here one is

01:29:30.659 --> 01:29:32.460
when the words were too much it's

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.739
probably the same reason why JJ had to

01:29:34.739 --> 01:29:36.900
leave like you're you're caught in your

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:37.980
own

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.980
vortex

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.000
and the words are distracting I mean so

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.159
so that

01:29:47.159 --> 01:29:48.540
is

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:52.920
often you know you have permission

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.800
to to to

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.659
the vortex is coming up and it's not

01:29:57.659 --> 01:29:58.739
words

01:29:58.739 --> 01:30:00.840
and the words are taken away from the

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.920
vortex then oftentimes we we get up and

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.560
we we sit with that ourselves

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.719
because it's still the experience came

01:30:09.719 --> 01:30:12.300
from the collective but you found your

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.460
right now this is your role to do or

01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.780
something

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.420
the the worm is in you or something like

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.280
that I say

01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:24.120
um and I had this very big insight

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.719
that I don't and maybe this is what was

01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:29.940
it was and it was

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.460
it's like a worm in you

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.159
um I was thinking about the you know I

01:30:35.159 --> 01:30:37.679
was listening to words and just letting

01:30:37.679 --> 01:30:40.560
them populate my head without

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.860
thinking about them or even relating to

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:46.560
them as words and thinking about the

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.940
problem and then I thought

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.080
at first I just got locked into

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.900
something and I wrote don't even know

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.340
where we are

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.320
and all of a sudden it occurred to me

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:02.340
like how could you tell an origin story

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:04.320
because we don't even know where we are

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.219
in the first place

01:31:07.739 --> 01:31:11.659
ah and that was like

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.940
yeah it was a big insight

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.320
so this is part of the you know we're

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.960
looking for epistemic constraints and

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:33.600
one of the epistemic constraints is that

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.360
we think we know where we are

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.600
foreign

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:45.380
which is just ridiculous

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:54.440
write the book

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.440
again Shaggy you have to what

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:00.239
yeah one of the chapters is the

01:32:00.239 --> 01:32:04.199
origins stories

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.120
what

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.980
my book's gonna have these like really

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:10.560
big titles and then just these down

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.840
Debbie downers well we can't tell the

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.520
origin story because we don't even know

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.900
where we are

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:19.880
then let's go into the next chapter

01:32:21.659 --> 01:32:24.659
but it's true it's it's a completely

01:32:24.659 --> 01:32:27.179
valid perspective

01:32:27.179 --> 01:32:31.020
100 dollars

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.880
how does that make you feel

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:37.020
well

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:41.040
I'm still feeling like it's quite

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.340
a new thing like it's like I don't

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:47.460
like as soon as we've gone that was like

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:50.820
where am I I don't know where I am I it

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:52.199
was very interesting it's very

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:54.420
interesting it's a great Freedom there's

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.940
a freedom with that

01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:01.320
um yeah and this it's it's also oh I

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.820
don't know

01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:04.980
when you first asked that question we

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:08.340
were talking before we got we went into

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:09.659
this

01:33:09.659 --> 01:33:12.420
um the question how did you get here

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.540
my immediate

01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.460
concern and my immediate thinking was

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:20.580
well I already have sort of an answer to

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.219
that I already can if I was in a

01:33:23.219 --> 01:33:25.199
conversation with someone and they'd

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:27.780
asked me that not here but I could say

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:28.739
something

01:33:28.739 --> 01:33:31.860
that um I would be comfortable with and

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.560
then I'll then I thought well I hope I'm

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.239
not going to do that when I'm doing this

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:38.520
I want something else I'm this isn't

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.820
enough but and that was also

01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.639
um sort of like an intent going in is

01:33:44.639 --> 01:33:48.360
not to totally allow what I would say in

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.400
a conversation about that

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.739
and that was really interesting because

01:33:52.739 --> 01:33:55.520
sometimes

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:58.679
what would a words

01:33:58.679 --> 01:34:01.500
I would see that they belong to how I

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.780
would talk with someone if they ask the

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.880
question then I would see beyond that

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.260
and

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:09.540
there was more there that

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:12.840
really it was still okay it was good it

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.100
was like yeah

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.340
I get that that's not just what I would

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:18.679
say

01:34:18.679 --> 01:34:20.880
I don't know what I'm talking about

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.679
really I don't know what I'm saying

01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:33.480
yeah I can share

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.040
um

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.900
I think you said something Bonnie about

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:39.480
like an unfamiliar pattern and that that

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:40.380
was

01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.199
um or that's what I'm remembering now

01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:45.060
um and that was my experience it felt

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:46.920
deeply unfamiliar the things I was

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.719
saying

01:34:48.719 --> 01:34:50.699
um it just felt extremely unfamiliar

01:34:50.699 --> 01:34:54.480
very novel so that's just interesting

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.280
um

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.900
[Music]

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.960
and I had the sense while doing it of of

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.179
it being like a very kind of rigorous

01:35:03.179 --> 01:35:04.739
discipline

01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:07.679
it felt very rigorous sort of like every

01:35:07.679 --> 01:35:10.500
you know okay you know like back to the

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.000
instruction you know just kind of like

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.280
pulled to that sort of like rigorous and

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.400
like formless at the same time and one

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:19.320
perception that I had that was kind of

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.000
interesting was like a couple of times

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.840
like it's like feeling the

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:27.300
texture or the spatial dimensions of the

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.360
group or of the space really shift like

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.060
a new color or a new scent or a new

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.440
Breeze or something that's like almost

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.260
like a big ship turning or something

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.300
um yeah like the texture and dimensions

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.980
of what was happening my perception of

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:43.500
it changed changed quite a bit and it

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.120
felt like something different was

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:46.800
opening up a different Rhythm or a

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.719
different texture was opening up

01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:54.060
so that was yeah my senses of it yeah it

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:56.460
feels bad yeah at this stage it's highly

01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:58.800
stylized right we call these are highly

01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:00.780
stylized practices because we're trying

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:05.820
to uh change our habits really fast

01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:09.360
um and then later on it's you know

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.320
um

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:11.520
as

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.139
some people have already done they've

01:36:13.139 --> 01:36:15.420
had to go and think of their own you

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:16.860
know these things

01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:18.540
are

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.760
much more flexible than than yeah but

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:27.360
you know if you if you start with the

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.580
highly stylized version you you make

01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:32.900
more progress faster

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:44.480
uh I can share something

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:47.880
um so a few things

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.179
I would I would notice I would get like

01:36:51.179 --> 01:36:54.120
like a scene or something or just like

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:57.179
like a cluster of words

01:36:57.179 --> 01:36:59.340
and

01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:01.080
and it it felt like they were coming up

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.760
too quickly to like you know name them

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.560
all at once

01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.940
um but like when I would I would go in

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.100
and then I'd kind of you know have these

01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.440
either emotions or memories or some

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:13.260
Sensations coming up

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.820
and then sometimes you know there'd be

01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:15.900
like a scene and it'd have like a

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.219
cluster of three or four words or

01:37:17.219 --> 01:37:18.540
something or someone would say something

01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.639
and there'd be like a kind of you know

01:37:20.639 --> 01:37:24.179
like a cluster or like a compression of

01:37:24.179 --> 01:37:27.840
uh words or concepts or something

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:29.100
um

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.440
and one thing I noticed was I was trying

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.380
to like okay

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:36.120
like what is

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.940
what is this threshold where it's enough

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:40.800
for me to want to say it and part of it

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:43.620
is like having to make my mouth move

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:45.840
um so I noticed I would like sometimes I

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.760
just said like orange a few times

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.960
because it feels like it's really easy

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.639
to say oh just like

01:37:50.639 --> 01:37:52.260
versus like

01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:54.300
subliminal like where you have to

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.040
because if you're just like if I'm just

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.420
resting

01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:02.100
it's like to get my mouth to like

01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:05.460
you know do um or uh like I have to put

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:07.199
my lips together versus if I'm just like

01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:10.500
orange it just kind of comes out

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.699
um

01:38:11.699 --> 01:38:14.100
so I felt like there was

01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:16.139
when I was in the resting state you know

01:38:16.139 --> 01:38:18.120
some words would have would be easier to

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.699
come out than others

01:38:20.699 --> 01:38:22.380
um

01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:24.780
and then also regarding the the

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:28.560
ping-ponging I noticed sometimes I would

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.600
like like I said I you know I was kind

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.300
of trying to feel into my body my source

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:35.100
or whatever and it's almost like there

01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.380
was like a substrate of

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.600
things or experiences or feelings that

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:42.179
would like be ready for me to say and

01:38:42.179 --> 01:38:44.040
then someone would say something

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.120
like

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.560
you know someone said Rocky and I said

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.100
Balboa which sounds kind of stupid

01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:50.820
um

01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:52.500
but it wasn't just like a pop culture of

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.300
reference so like reminded me of someone

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.699
and like but I couldn't like make those

01:38:56.699 --> 01:38:59.040
associations until after the fact

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.900
like it's like there's an association

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.120
made and then I realize it's like

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.739
connected to something

01:39:04.739 --> 01:39:07.020
deeper so it's almost like by going into

01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.179
the source there's like a you know

01:39:09.179 --> 01:39:10.620
something that's there's almost like a

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.900
subconscious layer of

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.360
things I'm thinking about that like

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.820
other people might trigger so it's like

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.560
kind of a dance between what people are

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:21.600
saying and what I'm I'm feeling

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.760
yeah these are all very good uh

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.699
noticings and they're also very common

01:39:26.699 --> 01:39:31.080
and and good strategies for

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.199
not like this notion of threshold I see

01:39:34.199 --> 01:39:36.900
I notice I can feel there's a lot of

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.120
words in my head let me just say orange

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.120
and then I don't have to say all those

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.580
words they didn't go away they're

01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.739
somehow still in me

01:39:46.739 --> 01:39:49.860
um and and good for you that you said

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:52.440
something you know so trying to let

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:56.340
everything keep sub threshold to Strings

01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:59.100
and strings and strings of words

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.159
um and also exactly what you said about

01:40:01.159 --> 01:40:03.840
Rocky Balboa

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.600
um a lot of people say things but when

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.000
something's brewing in you that's close

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.460
to the taste of a certain word when you

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:14.699
hear it it that's when you jump and so

01:40:14.699 --> 01:40:17.639
that's what the the jumping

01:40:17.639 --> 01:40:20.520
um is also not random as you're saying

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.920
it it's at it's actually had something

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.800
not like pop culture for you and then

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.239
sometimes we fall into

01:40:29.239 --> 01:40:32.580
more just blah blah blah at the surface

01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.739
level so these are really good noticings

01:40:34.739 --> 01:40:36.060
and you're starting to understand

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.219
something about the relationship between

01:40:38.219 --> 01:40:40.800
the body ruminating

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.080
putting up gestalts

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.100
then it becomes threshold to wanting to

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:49.440
have linguistic signifiers

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.659
and all this whole process is starting

01:40:51.659 --> 01:40:54.480
to slow down and open up space so you

01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:57.540
actually can see them and you can you

01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:00.300
can identify the biomarker of where

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.540
you're at in the process so

01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.540
so this is all very good

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:09.420
um and natural strategies that you're

01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:11.940
thinking of which are also

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:15.199
um very very good

01:41:16.980 --> 01:41:19.800
you know and you didn't say this but

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:22.080
something in your body language is a lot

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.260
of times whether it's a word cluster

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:27.900
or an image and a lot of times at this

01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.060
stage not really an image as it's like

01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.159
you have this feeling as if there's an

01:41:32.159 --> 01:41:34.860
image but it is not there and if you pay

01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.920
attention you can feel that the image is

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.600
in here

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.960
your body's doing something

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.719
thinking down there

01:41:45.719 --> 01:41:50.540
um and your image space

01:41:51.719 --> 01:41:54.239
knows that that usually means you see

01:41:54.239 --> 01:41:56.880
something and then you go off and see

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.860
the table and who's going to be sitting

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:01.440
there but because we've kept

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.060
all the

01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:05.100
thinking down there

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.540
there's a little bit of a disconnect

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:09.480
it's like I I feel like that's what it

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.159
feels like when I see an image but

01:42:11.159 --> 01:42:13.679
there's it's not there yet and but if

01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:15.619
you pay attention you can feel it

01:42:15.619 --> 01:42:18.840
usually right like down in here

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.840
uh where your body's thinking so all

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.380
these things are like

01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:27.600
very good signs you know that that you

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.000
didn't just get pop you know a movie

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.040
because that's sometimes what happens

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:34.560
you silence the words and then you get

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:37.320
the movie instead this is just another

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.739
version of

01:42:39.739 --> 01:42:42.659
you know not letting the

01:42:42.659 --> 01:42:44.880
not waiting for the body to think it

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.520
through some people get lots of popcorn

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.500
movies

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:52.460
um but I just want you to notice that

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:56.159
these kinds of challenges happen a lot

01:42:56.159 --> 01:42:59.219
in meditation but this simple Act of

01:42:59.219 --> 01:43:04.380
agreeing to say uh really helps us uh

01:43:04.380 --> 01:43:07.739
get much further faster

01:43:07.739 --> 01:43:09.300
um

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:10.560
do you know what I'm saying that

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.000
instruction of yeah

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.139
[Music]

01:43:13.139 --> 01:43:15.360
um it takes advantage of how the the

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.000
system works

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.219
um yeah so good noticing is good

01:43:20.219 --> 01:43:22.320
strategy I mean there's many

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.760
yeah good strategizing

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.260
there are a couple other things that

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:30.420
kind of nice things that came

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:33.060
back around as you were speaking uh

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.980
funny

01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:35.880
um

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:37.500
almost like I don't know it's a few

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.600
times it's like the

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:42.000
it's like I'd begin with

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.560
one word

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.360
but by the time

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.780
it kind of came around to like I'd kind

01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.340
of end with another word like the end of

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:52.380
another word

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:53.639
um

01:43:53.639 --> 01:43:55.800
it's like kind of yeah again it just and

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:57.719
becoming just less yeah less focused on

01:43:57.719 --> 01:43:59.880
the actual kind of yeah what what the

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.860
word is and just like yeah

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.440
and that happened a few times and then

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.280
also sometimes this um yeah they're sort

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.300
of like

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:11.280
I had my eyes closed for a lot of it too

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:14.280
I found it a lot uh something about it

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:15.659
was easier for me

01:44:15.659 --> 01:44:17.460
it's kind of quite distracting

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:19.739
um some people's faces and things I

01:44:19.739 --> 01:44:21.420
noticed when I when I tried to a few

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:24.780
times some NZ beat just more noting

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:25.739
um

01:44:25.739 --> 01:44:28.500
and

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.560
but then like kind of yeah the There Was

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.179
You said let's talk about image space

01:44:33.179 --> 01:44:34.739
there was like something visual

01:44:34.739 --> 01:44:37.139
happening but it wasn't kind of yeah

01:44:37.139 --> 01:44:39.239
pictures or things and like I didn't

01:44:39.239 --> 01:44:41.040
have words of them sometimes I would

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:44.880
like go to it was like no word for that

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:47.420
uh yeah notice that a few times yeah

01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:50.820
yeah so we're noticing that all these

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:53.100
building blocks are in your body

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:57.600
and then the and the mind is like the

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:01.139
jamboard that when it's ready uh

01:45:01.139 --> 01:45:04.500
it can project what the work it's done

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.260
for you for you the compound Angel

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:11.219
individual JJ to see but you don't have

01:45:11.219 --> 01:45:14.880
access to the process I mean there's

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.679
biomarkers

01:45:16.679 --> 01:45:18.739
um but when we think of being

01:45:18.739 --> 01:45:21.659
self-consciously aware

01:45:21.659 --> 01:45:23.760
um

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.420
because it's not of thinking with words

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:29.400
uh this is where I really

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.300
have a strong disagreement with verveiki

01:45:33.300 --> 01:45:35.600
I don't think thinking is dialogic

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.400
neither between people or inside your

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.280
own individual

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:43.860
um it's this other thing this other

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:48.540
natural intelligence now working out

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:52.500
things together is can be dialogical but

01:45:52.500 --> 01:45:53.580
I don't think

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:54.300
um

01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:57.480
the inside the image of the the novel

01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.880
Insight process is biologic

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.580
it's time for me it was so different

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:14.880
because I had my eyes closed

01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:17.699
and it made it like JJ you were saying

01:46:17.699 --> 01:46:19.380
it it just

01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:22.619
made it easier to stay

01:46:22.619 --> 01:46:26.280
in the rigor of the process

01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:28.080
and

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.940
a lot of it

01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:33.060
felt like stuttering almost like the the

01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.340
beginning of something would form and

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.260
it'd be like

01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:40.139
but there was nothing

01:46:40.139 --> 01:46:41.520
but a

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.139
like a sensation and

01:46:45.139 --> 01:46:47.940
nothing else right

01:46:47.940 --> 01:46:51.060
because because there's a release valve

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:53.699
when you start to say it

01:46:53.699 --> 01:46:59.040
the energy releases and and

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.040
um

01:47:01.619 --> 01:47:03.840
you know this was I used to call it

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.360
swallowing the words right like when I

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.580
was a kid I would do that

01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:12.480
um so it it gets you if you're you see

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.100
what happens is

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:17.400
your vigilance your attention is in the

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.360
moment

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.020
whereas when the whole sentence comes is

01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.699
because your attention's behind the

01:47:23.699 --> 01:47:25.980
scene the whole body's form this thing

01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:27.780
and then of course it gets really bad

01:47:27.780 --> 01:47:29.699
when you're strategizing and like what

01:47:29.699 --> 01:47:31.080
should I tell them and stuff like that

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:34.080
and sometimes we want to practice

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.900
the speech we're gonna give or something

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.520
um but eventually you realize even

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.100
that's not as good as

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.619
um letting the words come out of your

01:47:43.619 --> 01:47:45.239
mouth

01:47:45.239 --> 01:47:47.520
totally entirely

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.699
um independent of your mind

01:47:50.699 --> 01:47:52.320
um so

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.940
um yeah so these are all

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:59.159
progress uh

01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:01.980
and the other thing that I noticed was

01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.219
that at the beginning there was a lot of

01:48:04.219 --> 01:48:07.980
sensation behind my eyes like just this

01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:10.739
yeah in a very

01:48:10.739 --> 01:48:11.400
um

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:13.619
I felt like my eyes must be must have

01:48:13.619 --> 01:48:16.940
been moving all over the place and then

01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:21.360
that sort of dropped into a different

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.460
um I think it was Kevin and other people

01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.400
have said you know there's sir there was

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:31.219
this moment of kind of a shift of

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:34.100
coherence or something different

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:36.300
happening yeah

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.820
and all of that fell away that just

01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.199
happened to me a lot like I have like

01:48:40.199 --> 01:48:43.619
rem or something like and I think for me

01:48:43.619 --> 01:48:46.920
my I experienced it as like there's all

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:51.119
this energy in my My Language Center and

01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:54.560
and there's some kind of uh

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:57.360
prohibition and it's it just has like a

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.159
little seizure because you know you

01:48:59.159 --> 01:49:01.800
can't talk if your eyes don't move and

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:03.600
so you've prepared yourself not to do

01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.580
that but there's some like

01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.040
a little energy left and so your eyes

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.500
just just go crazy and I also want to

01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.600
say I don't close my eyes but I cannot

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.020
unless every once in a while I'll like I

01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:18.900
was trying to make sure Madeline was

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.540
okay and here and there look and then

01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:23.580
I'm not in the practice anymore I'm kind

01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:27.719
of looking but I can't look at you uh

01:49:27.719 --> 01:49:31.739
and hear I I stare at my painting behind

01:49:31.739 --> 01:49:33.119
me

01:49:33.119 --> 01:49:34.860
um uh

01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:37.380
because it's too social once you start

01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:39.360
looking and who said that and who said

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.520
that it brings you into a very social

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:43.440
kind of

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:45.659
um engagement which is just we're not

01:49:45.659 --> 01:49:48.480
we're not doing that so

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:51.480
um well we you know all these things we

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:53.820
do these highly stylized things and then

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.400
we reclaim the social but it has more of

01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:58.080
this kind of

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.199
quality of what I what are you

01:50:01.199 --> 01:50:03.600
exchanging in Social space would have

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:06.840
it'll have a different quality

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.100
um

01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:10.260
but again you know these are highly This

01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:13.199
is highly stylized practice

01:50:13.199 --> 01:50:15.420
was also very

01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:16.320
um

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.179
to do the current of

01:50:20.179 --> 01:50:24.860
the emotion from madalena

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:31.020
was somehow very both moving and

01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:34.980
soothing and

01:50:35.699 --> 01:50:37.800
um

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:39.739
I don't know what the word would be but

01:50:39.739 --> 01:50:43.020
distilling it was helping us all distill

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:47.960
in essence really really precious

01:50:54.179 --> 01:50:57.000
I want you all to know that I decided to

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.139
have dinner with you

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.920
oh

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.920
salud

01:51:06.719 --> 01:51:09.659
why should I wait meet by myself when I

01:51:09.659 --> 01:51:11.780
can eat with all of you

01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:15.490
[Laughter]

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:20.639
Zoe you look like you were enjoying

01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:23.520
yourself at a certain point in there

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:27.780
uh yeah it was my first time I

01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:29.960
foreign

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.420
lots of things were happening

01:51:35.420 --> 01:51:38.780
in my body

01:51:39.719 --> 01:51:42.000
so I felt like

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:46.080
yeah my body was very stimulated

01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.739
by

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:51.800
all the words

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.520
happening

01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.619
and it felt like sometimes they were

01:51:55.619 --> 01:51:57.179
kind of

01:51:57.179 --> 01:52:01.139
percolating yeah

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.840
through me like

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.940
and that was

01:52:05.940 --> 01:52:12.139
yeah both uh an image and a sensation

01:52:12.619 --> 01:52:17.300
and uh bon appetit

01:52:27.659 --> 01:52:30.719
I have an Impulse Bonnie you just

01:52:30.719 --> 01:52:34.340
dropped something I think is

01:52:39.239 --> 01:52:44.340
well for sure it's a life inquiry for me

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:47.840
and that's this

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.280
dance this play between

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:55.320
the social energy

01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:59.000
and being creative

01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:04.139
and what's beneath that that will allow

01:53:04.139 --> 01:53:07.440
us to find this deep level of meaning

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:10.619
that's not available to me once I get

01:53:10.619 --> 01:53:14.540
off the screen and I'm in my house alone

01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:18.000
so it is social and it ain't social

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:21.900
doing Collective Insight practice to me

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:25.320
yes I mean phase one this highly

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:30.560
stylized we want to calm down

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.940
you know the other side of social

01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:35.520
anxiety is social enthusiasm you know

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:38.520
come come that down

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.320
um but you just said something very

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:43.679
beautiful that that

01:53:43.679 --> 01:53:47.280
so okay so this is this is

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.520
potential Insight so yes there is this

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:53.639
one way in which

01:53:53.639 --> 01:53:56.940
we seem to be tapped into the same thing

01:53:56.940 --> 01:54:00.440
and it's not across each other socially

01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:03.420
it's something else that's like the

01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:04.980
compound individual

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:07.679
I know you already as soon as I started

01:54:07.679 --> 01:54:12.480
to say it hit Sam Sam got the diagram so

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:15.840
you see it's all fractal so David said

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:17.820
this kind of personal thing that was

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:20.040
just kind of be a parenthetical through

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.739
our thing but it happens to be in the

01:54:22.739 --> 01:54:25.860
form of the question like that there's

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:28.860
two things and they feel differently so

01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:30.960
we have compound individuals from here

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.960
down into the Earth or wherever what is

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.480
that direction and then we have the

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:39.440
social level uh there's different

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.060
mechanisms or different biomarkers so

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:45.000
what David said is what we call this is

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.360
a big thing an instance of itself it

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.280
sounded like he was just talking now

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.679
parenthetically to the experience but it

01:54:52.679 --> 01:54:55.920
happened to be in the form of the

01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.520
original question at this larger scale

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:01.380
this is also something that happens all

01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:03.000
the time in Collective Insight it was

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.480
like me worrying about my cat and then

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.260
it becoming the focus of what we were

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:13.860
talking about in terms of origin so

01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:16.619
um so that's that's very common like

01:55:16.619 --> 01:55:20.639
that's why the the arrangement

01:55:20.639 --> 01:55:23.100
lives in the world that somebody kept on

01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.619
saying here now Marie like it's got to

01:55:25.619 --> 01:55:28.139
be just here now

01:55:28.139 --> 01:55:32.400
um yeah so the local incident that makes

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:35.100
its that arises

01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.320
like as a facilitator I hear that and

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:40.679
I'm like oh my God that's exactly that

01:55:40.679 --> 01:55:42.840
is exactly that

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:44.760
so this is another thing you learn in

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:46.560
Collective Insight practice to notice

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.119
these things because at first we think

01:55:48.119 --> 01:55:49.800
we would get them as they're just

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:51.480
parenthetical

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:55.139
and some of them are they're local but

01:55:55.139 --> 01:55:57.500
then some of them are like in

01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.900
microcosm they're showing is the the

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:04.199
whole statement which is a microcosm is

01:56:04.199 --> 01:56:05.400
showing us

01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.719
something about the macro question

01:56:09.719 --> 01:56:13.199
and these are really cool ways of being

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:16.219
humans together

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.679
does that make sense David I mean

01:56:19.679 --> 01:56:22.860
because it was your your comment

01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:25.679
well for me it's an inquiry and it's

01:56:25.679 --> 01:56:27.600
going to stay in inquiry and it feels

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:31.380
good that I was heard but for me it

01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:33.119
really comes down to having dinner

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:35.880
together with Magdalena right now

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.719
it's like the connection

01:56:38.719 --> 01:56:42.960
yeah yeah you know and you know I know

01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:45.000
we're at the dinner table with you and

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:45.940
Yvonne

01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:49.580
[Laughter]

01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:53.659
I'm so hungry now

01:56:54.719 --> 01:56:58.440
you sure are I mean you know and it's

01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.060
like

01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:00.840
um

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.600
I think you know if we are to

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.020
um because

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.659
there was one question I didn't say that

01:57:09.659 --> 01:57:12.320
before but when the words went away

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:17.219
there was one question that kept looping

01:57:17.219 --> 01:57:20.900
what the hell is a body

01:57:22.679 --> 01:57:25.500
I mean like where's the edge yeah so

01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.540
that's your problem people have these

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:31.260
problems that will grasp them

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.480
and sometimes they'll stay

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:35.520
sometimes you'll come back and they're

01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:38.099
just not there Sometimes they come back

01:57:38.099 --> 01:57:41.099
around again but

01:57:41.099 --> 01:57:44.280
we let them presence in an absence

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.380
themselves

01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:52.099
um for us not by command and control

01:57:52.099 --> 01:57:55.380
as you said you know we don't even know

01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:59.580
where we are I mean you know I I keep

01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:02.360
looking at

01:58:02.460 --> 01:58:03.179
um

01:58:03.179 --> 01:58:06.659
Rey and Marie and

01:58:06.659 --> 01:58:09.480
you know and I've just been wondering

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.540
are they both in Italy

01:58:12.540 --> 01:58:15.960
yes in fact this is how cool if you look

01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.940
at Ray there's Marie in the background

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:19.860
and if you look at Marie

01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:22.380
you can see right in the background yeah

01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:25.199
I thought I was they can both be in the

01:58:25.199 --> 01:58:27.360
foreground and the background at the

01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:28.860
same time

01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:32.820
yeah and it's just so beautiful but I

01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:35.639
mean beautiful oh my God this is these

01:58:35.639 --> 01:58:41.159
words they're so up no but I mean

01:58:41.159 --> 01:58:44.099
that that that they're now involved in

01:58:44.099 --> 01:58:46.860
Italy you know and I'm just so

01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:51.300
there's something so Alegria you know

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:52.679
um there

01:58:52.679 --> 01:58:55.340
you know

01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.719
and and and you know I mean Susan's in

01:59:00.719 --> 01:59:03.060
Australia what the hell

01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:05.760
you know I mean

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.639
New Zealand sorry yeah

01:59:08.639 --> 01:59:10.980
um but I mean like if we ask the

01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:13.560
question you know what's a body a

01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:16.760
compound body I mean my body's

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:20.580
stretching in to all these different

01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.920
sort of

01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:24.020
the

01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:26.960
geographies from you know

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:30.000
having dinner with you I mean I imposed

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.900
that in a sense you know

01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:36.780
but you know it is my body that's

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.960
getting fed but you know as I drink the

01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.199
wine I'm I'm I'm toasting to you guys

01:59:43.199 --> 01:59:46.500
and you know it's like it you know

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:50.520
it's like now it's now you know it's not

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:53.400
like in five minutes or

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:56.639
or the next session you know and and

01:59:56.639 --> 01:59:59.340
there's a kind of

01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:01.580
um I don't know what the word is says

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:05.719
something comes out in Portuguese

02:00:05.719 --> 02:00:08.460
and you know it's like that was the

02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:10.980
other thing you gave me permission

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:13.619
for the other languages that was it they

02:00:13.619 --> 02:00:16.619
like the words all went away I think I

02:00:16.619 --> 02:00:18.900
think there's some connection between

02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:21.659
that I don't know I was like okay none

02:00:21.659 --> 02:00:26.099
of them you know like I just yeah none

02:00:26.099 --> 02:00:27.420
of them

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:31.260
um but it wasn't like a rejection or

02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:33.360
anything they're just

02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:35.580
you know just went for a walk or

02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:38.040
something you know

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:39.739
um

02:00:39.739 --> 02:00:43.440
okay with that I have to get going but

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.080
yeah so good job

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:46.800
um

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:49.860
and hopefully you your portals will

02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:54.619
absorb you into deeper

02:00:54.619 --> 02:00:56.540
contemplation

02:00:56.540 --> 02:01:00.659
and yeah until next time catch your mind

02:01:00.659 --> 02:01:03.920
enjoy your dinners



## Cohort 3

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.340
thank you

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.059
I think we should start today in

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.040
breakout groups

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
and I'll arrange the groups a little bit

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.760
so that people who haven't participated

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.180
in the first two kind of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.740
uh methodological

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.699
experiments

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.120
um Can Explain

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.460
from like trying to give a sense of what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.399
we've been trying to do but also then

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.579
just be frank about like

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.620
what's interesting or challenging about

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.860
it a couple people did reach out to me

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.680
after the last session this work can be

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.840
challenging

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.500
um

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.960
in

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.300
unsuspecting ways

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.420
um

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.760
and uh we don't have to go meta on it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060
we're just gonna try to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.880
survive through it we're halfway through

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
um and then maybe we can discuss it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.860
um

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.040
discuss you know we want to do our our

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.860
deep breaths but we don't you know I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.840
don't want to just go like all

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.520
meta on

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.560
on it so just from first personal

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.920
experience what you think is happening

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.380
here basically we're addressing the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.140
topic of Origins

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.680
um

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.380
I'll just give the Thematic

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.200
um and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.840
um noticing that when we do this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.880
as modern displaced uh somewhat

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.860
intellectuals of the Greek philosophical

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
tradition because we don't just believe

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.680
in the myths and even if we are like

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.159
Catholic and we can understand that the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.979
mythology is very helpful because it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.420
congregates

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.179
a community of practice

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.640
um

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.379
we are we are a little bit homeless

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.060
because we don't have a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.099
shared origin story that we truly

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.599
believe in and with the one being

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.660
believed in believe in in such a way

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.640
that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.260
it Glides it irrevocably guides the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.040
choices we make

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.239
like I kind of believe that if my heart

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.640
wasn't beating I would die hence I do

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.040
not take a knife and stab it into my

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.280
chest so this is an irrevocable belief

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.780
um but

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.959
we very not very few people

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.280
you know people will say they believe

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.959
that they sin they have to go to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.180
Purgatory which is just as bad as hell

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.620
except you get out but you don't know

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.300
you know if you really believe these

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.220
things it would irrevocably change your

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.599
behavior

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.599
so it can we

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.480
um and if you look at the way most

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.060
modern people are based on their

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.319
behavior

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.739
what they espouse you would you would

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.920
you would infer that what they

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.780
espouses a Newtonian dead Universe

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.239
because that's how collectively we uh we

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.860
behave in the world

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.739
so Katie and Schulte do not currently

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.959
look like they believe in an atonian

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.879
dead Universe

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.599
um

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.299
and

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.920
so one could infer that we most as a

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.799
collective and chorus I'm talking about

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.019
the virus that has infected most of the

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.680
globe and that's this Western humanism

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.120
uh we believe

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.000
uh we act as if we irrevocably believe

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.080
in a Newtonian universe

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.780
um with these these kind of strange

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.540
emergent

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.979
capacities that we don't we don't

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.139
understand okay so we're trying to tell

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.540
different origin stories and what we

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.880
find when we first do that

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.340
um is that we come up with epistemic

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.860
uh constraints

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.479
and in the first

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.660
uh session we noticed a lot of those

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.960
like maybe the universe wasn't living

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.080
from the beginning maybe it's it's we

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.360
know life has to come from Death so

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.120
maybe we don't ascribe enough

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.699
properties of death and I'm not talking

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.699
about dead matter but the way death is

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.660
alive or gives rise to life

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.780
and what if you know what if the origin

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.820
of the universe is something more like a

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.000
compost heat or

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.580
um something along those natures and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.720
other epistemic constraints are

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.000
um temporal ones the origin happened in

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.699
the past maybe time is part of the

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.460
origin story of maybe it's not

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.560
um we have constraints such as inside

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.560
and outside and then we have this other

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.840
this big constraint

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.419
um that is

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.280
um the the constraint between the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.259
compound

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.360
individual Samuel keeps bouncing in and

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.300
out here the compound individual and the

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.639
collective right so it's easy for me to

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.400
say I'm a compound individual

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.419
it

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.240
at many different kinds of compounding

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.180
because like my cells are compounded in

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.699
me in in a little bit different way than

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.479
the bacteria that live in my gut are in

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.900
me but I'm more like a habitat but they

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.080
communicate with me and

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.699
um

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.759
do the bacteria in my gut are they a

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.800
collective like a social collective in

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.320
there are they like where do these

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.460
things work and then at a society level

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.280
is society a compound individual and a

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.340
compound individual means that there's a

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.340
it compounds up to a single kind of

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.520
agency or a single kind of intention or

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.160
a single kind of choice

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.520
um is the earth a compound individual

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.860
made up of all its living members the

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.620
way my body is a compound individual

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.720
or is the Earth

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.300
and the solar system a compound

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.600
individual or are they a collective so

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.660
these are

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.780
current constraints on

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.780
um how we

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.620
um

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.360
tell our

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.360
tell our origin story and one way to sum

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.600
up it is that you could think of God as

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.000
the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.360
largest compound individual that's one

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.340
way to think of it would be a modern way

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.039
as opposed to

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.680
an external force and then here's the

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.539
creation

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.080
um and which would mean that creation is

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.560
Ingress or inside god

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.259
um the way my cells are inside me so all

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:33.240
these questions are up for contemplation

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.460
um we understand

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.960
um

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.960
this is not a linear exercise and so

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.940
that when at the end of the day we have

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.039
an answer and we fight about it blah

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.919
blah blah this is actual exercise and

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:49.520
what Jan silica would call lyric

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.520
philosophy

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.340
where we feel into the question and

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.380
whatever we come up with we try to

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.800
notice families that hang together

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.599
um

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:07.020
at this phase of the process so

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.360
we're doing that and we're also

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.539
practicing a strange methodology in a

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:15.000
very kind of brutal way in the sense

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.099
that we just jumped into it and it's on

00:08:17.099 --> 00:08:19.500
the internet which is always harder and

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.539
the methodology is called Collective

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:23.639
Insight practice

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.520
and this is where I'm going to leave

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.219
it's for your fellow fellow

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:36.240
sojourners uh to explain

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.860
um what they think Collective Insight

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.440
practices or

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.979
um what what you know it can be a very

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:47.519
odd strange explanation it's it

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:49.080
it's just

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.220
um

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.300
let's process process some of this

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.820
experience in smaller groups so I'm

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.320
going to do breakout groups so go for

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.839
half an hour and

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:01.500
um

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.899
I'm gonna fiddle it with it a little so

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:06.000
that some people have been here doing

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.339
the practice will be with people who

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.800
haven't been doing the practice

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.360
um

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.940
so I just need a little time to do that

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.380
I find this

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.980
quite confusing actually

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.380
uh

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.500
something is really weird

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.380
let's stop they want to put it wants to

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.660
put you all in one room it says room one

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.480
15 people

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.459
at our own

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:38.760
a lot of room out of room oh it's it's

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.040
okay I know it I know there's something

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.480
wrong

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.660
there's something wrong here

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.380
um okay

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.240
this is really

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.560
it doesn't give me the same things

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.459
uh

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.260
all right it's gonna make me do this the

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.519
long way around I might have uh

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:06.720
um

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.800
I might have changed it so let's see we

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.080
can we'll have her

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.640
her

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.580
move to two

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.779
and we don't want we can move him to two

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:24.360
uh

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.060
we can move

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.779
into one oh he's in one sorry if I'm

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:33.420
talking about you this way but it's a

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.980
little

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.260
confusing

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.980
uh we'll move her to three

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.700
and we'll move her to three

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.660
and

00:10:48.079 --> 00:10:51.060
four four to three okay there's three

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.680
girls in there we don't care about that

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:58.920
okay that's good and now we have to have

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.019
uh let's see we'll remove

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:09.120
four two four and him

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.160
whoops M two four and

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.800
for her two four

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.980
oh I should have played more video games

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.459
and this is let's see okay and then I

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:31.740
just have to split up one more uh this

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:36.300
is good I just have to split up one more

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.260
room and I think I'm done

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.500
yeah that's good

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.000
that's good

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.899
that's good

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.740
that might be tough

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.779
if I'm gonna change her then what's this

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:57.079
one

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:02.360
okay I'm going to move

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.779
her to hear and

00:12:05.779 --> 00:12:08.880
into here

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.980
okay

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.540
enjoy your company enjoy your

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.540
conversation uh we'll see you in a half

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.839
an hour

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.000
good David's smiling this kid this kid

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.200
all right what do we got for our viewing

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.860
audience

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.360
uh a question that came up in our group

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.279
or the question I'm wondering about is

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:05.579
like how do you hold or not hold the

00:13:05.579 --> 00:13:08.100
intention of the themes that we're

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.959
exploring

00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:11.760
um when you're just kind of saying

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.860
what's coming to mind directly and then

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.480
there's kind of like ping-ponging off

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.680
the group and maybe going in different

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.360
directions like

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.160
are you

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.560
like maintaining some kind of internal

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.579
tether

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:25.680
to the intention or yeah if you just

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.160
speak to that

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.139
yeah it's a great question and it it is

00:13:31.139 --> 00:13:33.300
a big part of defining Collective

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.540
Insight practice so if we had a stronger

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.620
common context like our neighborhood was

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.500
on fire uh six months out of the year

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.240
and we want to do something about it

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.440
that holds the common intention

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.860
um so our common intention is to come up

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.079
with an origin story it probably lives

00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:57.300
in me more of a burning thing right now

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.920
than everybody else

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.320
um and so that's why I think I said that

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.180
it not that you know I said a lot of

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.279
things the very first time

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:08.579
um but but this is why I say Collective

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:10.500
Insight practice is a three-legged stool

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.760
you need the individual you need the

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.459
collective and you need a strong common

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:18.600
context that's in the world that's real

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.360
that allows you then to go all over the

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.860
place and stuff you don't have to worry

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.600
because you're sitting here trying to

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.760
solve something

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.500
um whereas when the problem itself is

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.500
sort of meta then it then it gets into a

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.380
very generative liminal spaces

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:38.459
um but it it's then it it would by kind

00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:40.320
of just by definition not be Collective

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.899
Insight practice so

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:44.160
um

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.760
um so having this shared context is is

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.680
and especially if it's more the more

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.060
concrete it is the more uh fruitful

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.139
um

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:59.480
the methodology can can seem

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.620
so what you notice is we were basically

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.360
practicing the methodology more than

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.980
trying to solve the problem which is

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.100
okay uh because that's kind of where

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.320
we're at and we in that shared context

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.160
isn't as as strong

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
um

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.639
that's an excellent question

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.399
so it's still like a collective insect

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:36.899
practice if it's just like for the

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:40.740
experience of flux that we experience

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.540
without like necessarily having this

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.000
shared context or

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
yeah and the whole thing is here's the

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.459
funny thing

00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:52.680
a lot of the things you guys have said

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.220
have been ruminating in me because I

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.380
have this intention and so then I

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.540
participate actually I've made a lot of

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.519
progress just now just by sending you

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:04.500
guys into the breakout room and worrying

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.320
about what you would say created a

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.019
different kind of process in my mind

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:13.260
and that I have read this thing I said I

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.199
I was trying to solve something and I

00:16:16.199 --> 00:16:19.320
sent it to the notes and

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.079
yes all these things are still

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.980
Collective Eve and so in many cases when

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.660
there's not a strong shared context

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.820
you'll see that

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.820
um

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.660
that something will present itself to an

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.519
individual and it's their thing to solve

00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:40.920
uh but the funny thing is that the

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.380
process somehow

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.839
is relevant anyways

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:48.000
I mean it can't be so diametrically

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.160
opposed that you know but like you saw

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.160
JJ he started getting like oh I I need

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.620
to go away and think about this and

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.060
so

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.740
so

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.959
um yeah so it's always it's always

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:03.779
valuable at some level

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:05.339
um and

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.079
um and

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.660
it produces

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.459
you know for some people it's it's it's

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:15.299
been energetically uh challenging that's

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.699
kind of interesting right because what

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:19.559
are we doing nothing we're trying not to

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:22.919
talk so much I mean really this is this

00:17:22.919 --> 00:17:25.439
is and and so

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:29.040
um yeah but if you had a shared context

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.840
um

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.780
then these little things that seem

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.900
synchronous and special become much more

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.720
obviously uh synchronous and special

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.460
a joke

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.059
yeah hi Bonnie it's good

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:57.000
uh you said you were worried about what

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.440
we would say

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.900
what were you worried about

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.280
did I say the word worry uh-huh I did oh

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.260
uh

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.960
um well it's been challenging for people

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.440
and kind of disorienting and

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.500
um and on a certain level of analysis

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.179
it's like

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:20.039
what we had an Insight the other day

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:21.539
that how could you tell a story of the

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:23.039
origin if we don't even know where we

00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:26.820
are and if I had reported that to a task

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.440
force I think that'd be kind of funny

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.059
you know I mean I wasn't worried like

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:32.580
really worried but like

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.740
certain it's a it's a strange

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.919
methodology at first you know

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:38.820
um

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.260
um but I also did a trick

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.580
because because when I invited people to

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.200
tell new people what they've been doing

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.660
then then usually

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.520
um a lot of that this is stupid energy

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.559
goes away because there is something

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:57.660
that they might share that it's been

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.460
beneficial too so that's all that was

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.000
also part of knowing that like

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.919
to get both sides out would be very

00:19:04.919 --> 00:19:06.660
important but I I wanted to give people

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.700
permission to to also say that it that

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.400
it's not like we did these two two days

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.400
of this exercise and it's like a godsend

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.080
or something like that because that's

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.679
that's not what if that's like

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:27.260
so uh you're not on commission

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.559
I was tricked

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:36.059
yeah you accomplished it and sitting

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:37.380
here

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.120
I feel like

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.240
I would be running away as a thief

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.780
not sharing what we

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.940
process together

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:02.160
we is Raj Ray

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.059
and myself

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.860
rather than my take on it I would love

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.720
to hear either Raj or Rey share the

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.160
process we went through

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.900
you also had the Dream Team and actually

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.660
I now that you've said it I realized I

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.299
put the dream team together and I was

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:32.760
being intentional but not quite that

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.100
intentional but I do want to to notice

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.460
that also oh

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.100
because of your prior experiences with

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.419
death

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:45.240
with that duo there

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.280
well I'll just say being in the

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.700
conversation with Ray and and uh having

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.799
um Murray in the room it's like being an

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.480
Escher painting the hand drawing the

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.059
hand it's like well there's a back and a

00:20:57.059 --> 00:20:59.400
who's back in whose front it was this

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.160
this sort of moment of reflection uh and

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.720
Paradox we had to deal with

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.100
but Ray you can jump in

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.120
thanks

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.799
so

00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:20.600
well I I mean

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.419
what makes what makes sense to me in

00:21:24.419 --> 00:21:26.039
terms of what we were

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:29.580
kind of trying to point that

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.240
was

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.059
what happens with this sense of

00:21:36.059 --> 00:21:38.159
I call it oscillation because that's

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:40.020
just what it feels like

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.380
but this sense of

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.360
um self and other or or I in that

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.020
or this and that

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.539
during the exercises where there's

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:58.320
there's a sense of self that's

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.500
um realizing something

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.080
and then the kind of energy that it that

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.200
that it takes anyway for me

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.140
to to digest that

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.659
the something and the eye are no

00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:14.960
different

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:18.419
and then the kind of the resultant

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:20.480
kind of um

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.940
space or moment that that allows or

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.380
affords

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.419
and then the three of us were talking

00:22:27.419 --> 00:22:30.720
about in an experience with this Gap

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.419
with this sense of Gap with a sense of

00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:38.400
of of this or that and I I offered

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.480
um

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.600
uh I read that that quote from

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.520
um Christopher Alexander that talks

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.299
about

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:49.200
that the sense of of I is is present in

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.539
the universe

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:53.700
and so that and then

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.580
um David talked really beautifully about

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.580
this sense of this Gap that actually is

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.700
feels necessary and and it feels I'm not

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.500
going to use the words you use David or

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.380
perhaps you both can help me but the

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.740
sense that that space needs to be

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.179
included

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:13.860
but also

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.100
in it in a gentle way

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.020
and it in a

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.520
in a way where it it that Gap or that

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.500
what seems to be this Gap or this kind

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.600
of oscillation or a membrane

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.820
or the sense of self and other can be

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.100
actually

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:36.059
contained within that Gap so that

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:39.059
in a sense that starts to feel necessary

00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:41.520
that space feels necessary

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.580
but it but it's less about feeling

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.799
separate and more about feeling this

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.940
kind of

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.940
this this impulse of our or this pulse

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.940
uh yeah um

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.620
so

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:09.179
we were engaging in sharing with Raj our

00:24:09.179 --> 00:24:11.340
experience of this practice this muscle

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.140
building we're doing

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.539
and

00:24:15.539 --> 00:24:18.780
I had two filters going on looking at

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.000
that question that how I wanted to share

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.900
one is the Rick Rubin interview

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:29.159
meditating to feel the music to feel the

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:32.460
search for the origin just coming from

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:35.039
the feeling and getting rid of all the

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:37.919
distractions that are in the way so the

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.620
exercise is a meditative process of

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.299
feeling

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:45.840
and then the other filter was your

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.000
it was too many words for me to read

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.580
quickly this morning but this

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.340
language model the universal language

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.580
model that you talked about and this

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:01.200
this sense that the native language had

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.640
no one two three four they had more or

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.940
less and you said in your words two

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.840
words at the end of a paragraph

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.700
pardon yourself

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.840
to that vastness of more and less not

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.260
the focus of one two three four how the

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.080
heck do I Harden myself to fasten this

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.260
money

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:29.580
yeah I didn't say that that was that

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.740
direct quote and I put it up because

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:35.460
madalina went on that riff right the end

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.080
of the last thing and she didn't have

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.240
time to she was more like channeling

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.279
these these guys

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.840
um but it's very interesting because

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.640
this is kind of like what would happen

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.559
in Collective Insight you know then

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:49.380
someone goes and she started saying this

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.900
you know the snakes beware this and then

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.799
I and I then I read the award-winning

00:25:55.799 --> 00:25:59.820
the thing on astral codex and then there

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.279
was an article on the snake she was

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:05.039
talking about yesterday like in this

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:07.500
these so this is like the whole universe

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.240
is doing like Collective Insight

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.980
practice and we talked about paying

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.380
attention to

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.960
um the period in between is

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.960
participating too and and

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.380
um yeah that's us that that that so my

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.419
point is Harden

00:26:24.419 --> 00:26:25.980
um

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.820
I would not want to

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.159
I noticed myself when I read that

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:33.720
article

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.559
um

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.779
you know they would never tell an origin

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:39.240
story no one was there right like why

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.039
you ask that question it's silly no one

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:43.380
was there at the origin but the thing

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.120
that I thought was interesting in that

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.740
article it may have been in a side

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.480
article that I found the article from

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.440
but

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.260
it was like it said that they don't have

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.179
to ask us questions because they know

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:57.360
where they oh it said something like

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.659
the religious person can't

00:27:00.659 --> 00:27:04.140
uh Everett I guess said he was trying to

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.059
convert them he says you can't convert

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:08.039
them because they're not lost

00:27:08.039 --> 00:27:10.679
they know where the river is I thought

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:13.440
that for me you know so on the one hand

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.700
I didn't want to be a person that

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.940
couldn't count and and and

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.960
um

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.960
uh but that the the quote that lived for

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.600
me in that was you can't convert these

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.220
people because they're not lost they

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.740
know where the river is and this lived

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.320
in me because I was like it's but it's

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.679
the same question for us you know for

00:27:34.679 --> 00:27:37.020
them their their life is very concrete

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.779
and they know where the river is and for

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:42.779
us our life is very abstract we don't

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:45.240
know what what our river is

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.600
never mind where the river is like we

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.120
don't know we don't and and then so then

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.400
I reclaimed the origin story like for us

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.400
the origin story is the river

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.559
um so

00:27:58.559 --> 00:28:00.600
um

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.659
yeah I'm just yeah somehow Dead all that

00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:05.700
all fits in there yeah and then they had

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.039
you know from our perspective they had a

00:28:08.039 --> 00:28:09.840
lot hard lives but it was also careful

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.620
to say like

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.980
[Music]

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.919
you know they're not necessarily less

00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:19.380
happy than we are or whatever

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.820
um

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.539
um well they did they I I totally forgot

00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:27.360
that I brought that up in my room when I

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.340
saw your practically unconscious you

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.400
were just your subconscious was just

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.539
coming out

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:36.779
I I totally forgot and so when I saw

00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:39.120
your post I'm like oh I'm so glad she's

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.260
connecting this because you know like

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.779
wonderfully surprised you know it's like

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:49.200
oh something's working you know because

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.200
um it's something that that is there you

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.240
know mostly I mean I I I I I I I

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.320
commented I don't know if you've seen

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.220
but yeah well I just love the the story

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.200
when you know they're having a

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.120
conversation about Jesus and they're

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.340
asking me Everett

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.600
you know

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.960
um so is he tall like you are he said

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.720
well I don't really know

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.480
um does does he have red hair because he

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.880
had red hair did you have red hair like

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.700
you oh no no no then what color is it

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.279
well you know it must have been like

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:27.960
dark

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.620
must have been and do you have blue eyes

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.559
like you oh no definitely not so what

00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:37.679
color oh you know probably Brown and

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.960
then he thinks for he thinks about it

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.260
for a minute and he says Everett we like

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.520
you

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.620
but can you stop talking about this

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.899
Jesus because you obviously don't know

00:29:48.899 --> 00:29:53.059
him you don't know you've never met him

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:55.740
now that I'm

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:59.340
going to be here uh this also moved in

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.460
my imagination because this notion of

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.100
well why talk about origin stories you

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.380
weren't there right maybe this is the

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.260
hardened thing David so the origin story

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.059
okay I wasn't there and but then I

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:15.659
thought but Mata was there

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:18.299
and the photons were there and then I

00:30:18.299 --> 00:30:20.520
started channeling Rich Blundell like

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.059
like and and I think this is what the

00:30:24.059 --> 00:30:26.039
chapter will be like like it's The

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:29.460
Greatest Story Ever Told except at first

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.059
it only could be told like like

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:36.419
the energy can only speak one way and

00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:39.179
that's through movement and change

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:41.820
and so because like I don't get I can

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.559
never understand what Rich was saying

00:30:43.559 --> 00:30:45.120
really because I know he doesn't mean it

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.120
as a metaphor that you know the universe

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.940
is telling its own story but it's so

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.779
then I was thinking of like and then so

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:57.480
so

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.360
it's not like the story of the origins

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.700
is like something we tell in past time

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.700
this epistemic constraint is that back

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.220
then the only way it could tell its

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.140
story was through patterns of energy

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.320
patterns of movement movement and change

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.679
because it right and then and then but I

00:31:16.679 --> 00:31:18.419
also got this from reading the astral

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:20.520
codex 10 and you'll see why I mean

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.919
everything started to like populate so

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:25.320
then what's the next way the universe

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.720
can tell a story through pattern and

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.120
repetition so now you get things that

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.700
are starting to hang out a while and

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.440
have patterns so this is like matter

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.760
right

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.940
and then the next thing is through

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.080
relation

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.720
and so the internal external relation so

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.820
now you start to see compound

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:48.299
individuals and collectives

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:50.340
then the next thing and this is kind of

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.640
a big jump but is it starts now to be

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.919
part of the astral codex 10 where he

00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:58.620
talks about children

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.960
should learn

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.880
when they're young they should learn

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.020
like like uh

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.820
like when they're really young it's very

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.039
similar to public school when they're

00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:13.200
very young they're like primitive people

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.020
they should learn in somatic and mimetic

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.059
ways so we should we should talk to the

00:32:18.059 --> 00:32:21.120
core self basically and then at the next

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.000
level they should learn in memetic and

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.520
gestural ways right so they learn how to

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.679
cook by watches something Sandra talked

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:30.140
we spent a lot of time in the kitchen

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.100
and then evolutionary in our history we

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.559
um became oral and he talks about like

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:39.840
kids in in

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.539
um Middle School are bored under their

00:32:42.539 --> 00:32:44.520
gourds because they're at the stage

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.440
where they want to gossip and they want

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.179
to tell Mythic stories and they want to

00:32:48.179 --> 00:32:51.419
tell look at Heroes and they do this ad

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:54.059
nauseam and in their own time and he's

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:57.059
saying school at this age should take

00:32:57.059 --> 00:32:59.580
advantage this is the cognitive strength

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.580
at that age and so tell history of like

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.159
and he constantly like tell that story

00:33:05.159 --> 00:33:07.860
of Isis and Osiris but tell Benjamin

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.260
Franklin and tell this and and when you

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.179
tell science tell the story of the man

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:13.860
who invented science and those of you

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.440
who see the

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.360
YouTube State Channel I often share

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.340
moracetam yeah that's he always tells

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.559
science by these great like what his guy

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:25.019
was doing and and that's how you would

00:33:25.019 --> 00:33:27.120
tell science during that and then the

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.179
philosophic and theoretic stage and then

00:33:30.179 --> 00:33:34.620
he says we're in is closely uh parallels

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.200
made of modernism where they in the

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.600
ironic or reflexive stage

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.700
and then build another stage so

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:44.519
basically what we see is not that we are

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:46.320
here privileged to tell the story the

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.260
origins the origin story and it's

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.340
telling

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.440
is the same thing

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.179
and and so at each level at each at each

00:33:57.179 --> 00:34:01.019
new departure the same story is being

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:04.080
told we're actually not telling any

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.059
different story than the first story of

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:08.339
movement and change

00:34:08.339 --> 00:34:09.119
um

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:11.940
but as each of these new ways of telling

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.099
the stories

00:34:14.099 --> 00:34:16.080
come through

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.359
each other

00:34:18.359 --> 00:34:21.419
um then it just adds to the story

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:25.440
and so never in history will you be at a

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.879
point where you can tell the origin

00:34:26.879 --> 00:34:29.040
story

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.619
the the origin story so this is the

00:34:31.619 --> 00:34:33.899
temporal thing we talked about right so

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:34.679
like

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.159
like

00:34:41.339 --> 00:34:43.619
yeah so

00:34:43.619 --> 00:34:46.200
my point is is that

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.260
um

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.619
it's not it's not trivial insignificant

00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:56.399
that these threads are coming together

00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:57.839
because

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:00.119
that we've spent four hours I mean when

00:35:00.119 --> 00:35:02.099
madalina whatever she was channeling and

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:04.020
then it became that thing and then I saw

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.060
that thing and then you guys said this

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.700
thing I mean there's something in

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.060
this kind of practice that that

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.740
works like that Raj

00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:20.220
thank you Bonnie I wonder then

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.300
um

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.820
but there's a couple of things are very

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.460
powerful in this bit of the inquiry

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:29.040
particularly you can't convert those

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.980
people because they're not lost

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.520
and so then I wonder if part of our

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.720
um

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.180
our confusion is actually believing that

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.040
we are lost

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.859
when in actuality we're not right but

00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:45.780
there's some confusion there

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.900
and when I was in the practice with

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.900
David and with Ray what occurred to me

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.280
was that this is actually evoking

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.200
multiple

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.859
ways of knowing it's not just a rational

00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:02.420
language

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.560
dichotomy but it's calling forth

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.920
intuition it's calling forth somatic

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.020
it's calling forth emotions calling

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.480
forth senses which is something that

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.720
maybe we've forgotten

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.579
um but anyway that's what occurs to me

00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:20.339
is I'm listening to you yeah and I think

00:36:20.339 --> 00:36:22.320
in the way you just put it you're right

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.619
in line with what the article said and

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:29.880
that is he says but remember this is not

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.220
a stage Theory it's not you're never

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.680
done with the somatic you're never done

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.540
and and

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.119
um so he so he says so by the time

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:40.619
you're in high school the high school

00:36:40.619 --> 00:36:44.520
teacher has to tell the story

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.700
with a lot of somatic and to tell a hero

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.160
story and then cap it off with the big

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.440
picture story and then saying like the

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.619
electron you know this is what it does

00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:58.619
um so it's actually the also the

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:01.079
capacity the instructor

00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:03.540
is really important in this that they

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.339
can Encompass

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:06.900
um but then on the other hand he said

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.480
but it sounds like the instructor has a

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.079
lot to do but you're basically just

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:16.020
triggering

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.260
the cognitive tools of the of the of the

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.780
person anyways you know and I love this

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.960
because this is one of those like

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.660
um a hidden in plain sight you know we

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.280
go on and We complain that high school

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.140
kids all they're interested in is like

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.700
like

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.960
um

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.599
um oh like at one point he says in the

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:38.579
Mythic the kids are interested in

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:41.579
binaries right good they want good

00:37:41.579 --> 00:37:44.280
Heroes fighting with villains and they

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.960
want you know

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.820
um and then and so so then

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.579
he says but doesn't this make them

00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:54.599
polarized and they're going to come you

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:56.520
know become a polarized nation and he

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.500
goes no because all the great binary

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.640
stories

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.099
they resolved attention at a higher

00:38:02.099 --> 00:38:06.300
level right so like the person

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.920
who

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.000
um

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.700
he under there's always some kind of

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.720
release like like Luke Skywalker's worst

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.339
enemy is his father

00:38:17.339 --> 00:38:20.300
so now there's this this

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.920
these stories they start with binaries

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.720
because then in the head of the child

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.359
they problematize the binary and so the

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:29.180
head has to go

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:32.520
what do I do with that you know and so

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.960
he talks about you know uh when and he's

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.680
like you know every great scientist was

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.380
in philosopher they were scandalous like

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.300
they had too many wives and this and

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.220
that and he's like so if you told the

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.800
story this way like kids the kids know

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.560
when they're in the gossip stage there's

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.420
something alive for them and then

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.520
science becomes alive because they know

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.740
that their parents lives are scandalous

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.540
and their families lies are scandalous

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.359
and they'll say well I'll never be a

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:05.700
philosopher because they're not

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.099
scandalous you know and I love this way

00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:10.380
of saying what's hidden in plain sight

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.619
is

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:16.680
the you know the the power and the

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.839
potential that we have

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:21.060
um so this was a review of the book I

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.760
did buy the book so um

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.359
um it's uh uh

00:39:27.359 --> 00:39:28.320
um

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.440
the book is called

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.020
um if you look in the notes I think I

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.940
wrote uh it's like a 100 page review uh

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.660
um the book itself I I think the pop-up

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.359
school notes and it's it says astral

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:47.220
code codex

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.520
10 has this book review

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.160
competition in a book this one the book

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.380
review competition but the actual book

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.640
is by

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.560
yeah so Magdalena put this the the

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.760
um

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.820
link to the book review

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.300
and the book is called the educated mind

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.800
Eagan

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.640
uh last name Egan first name Karen Irish

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.640
k-i-e-r-a-n

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.180
um

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.760
you know and none of these people are

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.520
talking about origin stories but yeah

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.680
this way of

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.320
this way of sourcing a question and

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.240
being obsessed with it and and then like

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.200
whatever's coming at you in uh Insight

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.359
practice or in the world it just keeps

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:49.040
building these questions

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.400
something like that Holly

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.700
yeah so I was in a breakout room with

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.980
eche and mad

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:01.619
and mad was talking about

00:41:01.619 --> 00:41:03.780
um her experience of having just sort of

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.460
tears come from the last Insight

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.980
practice and I had a similar experience

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.960
as well

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.520
um and I find that happens actually a

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.220
lot like the sort of wave of of grief

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.160
will just sort of hit with no no story

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.300
to it

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.859
um just the body sort of working

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:22.680
something out and then as David was

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.040
talking and Ray about sort of the Gap

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.599
um I was just thinking about all of our

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:29.040
organ stories

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.800
um of coming into this world

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.060
um that we all come into this world

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:35.160
crying that we all come in Born

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.339
screaming our heads off

00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:39.900
um and that there's maybe something

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.280
there

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.800
um about lament or grief

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.160
um as our roles as human beings

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.000
um

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.099
yeah that's all I want to share

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.400
yeah and and like I said I

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.320
I've kind of thrown you into a brutal

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.599
version of it but we did and it's

00:42:06.599 --> 00:42:08.520
important if you're doing this to let

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.619
people know that

00:42:10.619 --> 00:42:13.280
you see

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.160
conversation is our way of releasing

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.680
social anxiety and social enthusi

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.079
enthusiasm but also personal anxiety

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:25.140
it's very hard for us to

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:29.160
ask the body to cultivate the question

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.099
um and and

00:42:32.099 --> 00:42:34.800
um what happens in people's bodies are

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.740
different permutations

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.339
um

00:42:38.339 --> 00:42:42.599
um and they all are all the permutations

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:45.420
are relevant to the question

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.240
um it's just the

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:51.119
path the the body and then the

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:52.619
collective body is going to take to

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:54.599
something that feels like a resolution

00:42:54.599 --> 00:42:57.599
which then would feel very liberating

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:59.160
yeah

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.160
um

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.060
but that's that's

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.180
uh something that

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.040
um took us when we were doing the first

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.680
experience experiments a long time to

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.920
understand

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.079
um

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.720
so this group is more sophisticated uh

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.000
if you do it in other groups people

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.619
start

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:39.619
um

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.819
someone says something and then they

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.619
take it the wrong way because they're

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:45.900
already frustrated so that they pinged

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.520
off of instead of us

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.160
slightly pinging off of things

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.440
there are there are bodies already in a

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.339
habit of being frustrated or

00:43:55.339 --> 00:43:57.540
anticipatory sometimes too and then it

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:01.560
pings off of that it and so so

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.660
um uh

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.960
people get confused because they kind of

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.020
um

00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:12.960
then they they then you understand the

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.520
difference between when you get pinged

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.859
like that versus what JJ said like

00:44:16.859 --> 00:44:19.020
something opened up for him and it was

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:21.599
like he could it was like an Insight

00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:25.319
that wasn't presencing itself yet

00:44:25.319 --> 00:44:27.720
um and sometimes it happens on an

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.880
individual basis and

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.700
um yeah so

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.099
these are these are just oh man they're

00:44:35.099 --> 00:44:38.760
in Italy they're drinking wine it's

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.200
probably like

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.660
real Italian wine

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.640
and

00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.359
you know

00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:50.280
salute

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.060
Sandra

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.920
Ray where are you when I need you

00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:06.000
so this is a kind of a messy

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.359
uh a lot of different things

00:45:09.359 --> 00:45:10.560
um

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.160
in a in our conversation actually Holly

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.300
we

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.220
were

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.060
talking about birth and

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.200
um

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.020
and Trauma and

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.180
what

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.760
what that moment

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.420
of birthing is about as

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.000
you know obviously it's not the origin

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.940
at one level but it's

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:40.730
An Origin in a way

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:41.339
[Music]

00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:42.839
um

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:44.220
and

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.619
just anecdotally

00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:49.740
my babies didn't cry when they came in

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.640
they looked around

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.099
they took a breath and just

00:45:56.099 --> 00:45:58.940
looked around

00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:01.200
but they were home so I don't know if

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.760
that made a difference and I think

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.680
that's you know that whole like hold

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:07.260
them upside down and like whack them on

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:08.760
the butt

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:13.319
not necessary at all

00:46:13.319 --> 00:46:15.180
um

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.420
and going back to Rey and the

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:21.060
oscillation and

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.800
um

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.040
the Gap and sort of this

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.760
question of what is this process doing

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.839
in US

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:37.920
yesterday I did my usual practice and my

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.780
breathing practice and then I was just

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.460
kind of

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.260
lying on the Earth and

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:49.700
having this experience of

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.980
prefrontal cortex activity behind my

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.380
eyes like I did in our

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.319
presencing on Thursday and then this

00:46:58.319 --> 00:46:59.540
other

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.180
deeper kind of

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.520
movement

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.980
around my navel and

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.980
um belly

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:15.660
and the familiarity of all of the

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.960
narrative that is assembled seemingly

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.060
right here

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:25.260
almost so predictable every storyline

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.960
has been told a thousand times to either

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.619
defend or explain or

00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:32.660
blame or

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.240
uh you know reduce my own agency

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.880
whatever whatever it is they're all

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.180
almost pre-fabricated like chat GPT

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.220
would be

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:46.920
typing away

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.579
and it was a very pronounced like

00:47:50.579 --> 00:47:56.240
physical experience and then this deep

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:03.180
fluid liquid silence that had a whole

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.980
other

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:08.880
nameless quality to it

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.000
and there's there's the this and the

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.339
that just inside my own body

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.440
you were up

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.099
Socrates

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.240
I told that story about wanting to get

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.099
rid of The Ledger

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:30.599
what's up

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:32.760
when I was that was what was happening

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.880
to me like my head would just want to

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:39.119
explode because I would not let it take

00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:41.880
that habit like it was just and this is

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.900
very

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.839
it's kind of like in the movies where

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:47.579
you can't do this and you can you see

00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:51.660
like this this shock wave it's very

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.119
physical because basically

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:57.060
we know that mental phenomenon are

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:02.220
movements and you're starting to

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.440
um at first you just breathe and release

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.359
it but you're starting to be serious

00:49:06.359 --> 00:49:11.099
about no you're not doing that and and

00:49:11.099 --> 00:49:13.339
and and and

00:49:13.339 --> 00:49:16.339
it it's it's

00:49:16.339 --> 00:49:18.859
doing it like

00:49:18.859 --> 00:49:23.819
this because you're a squeaky and and

00:49:23.819 --> 00:49:28.020
um so I find that to be similar to uh my

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.400
own experience in other people's

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.380
experiences

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.900
um so

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.880
um

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:39.599
yeah I mean it's it's it's

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:42.000
interesting because it doesn't have a

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.020
lot it's not like a

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.720
just explain to people what she's not

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.000
talking about is like a disorienting

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.339
psychological psychedelic phenomenon

00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:56.880
it's it's actually extremely physical

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.500
um kind of like when if you take

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.640
Ayahuasca and they tell you you're gonna

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:02.160
vomit and then you vomit it's just

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.599
vomiting

00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:04.200
um

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:10.260
um but it's it's a very uh it's a you

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.619
know it's a very good marker of

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:15.680
um

00:50:17.339 --> 00:50:19.680
yeah that you're letting your body think

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.660
and then your mind is the canvas on

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.140
which it allows you as

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:30.120
Sandra to read out the output

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:30.720
[Music]

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.380
um

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.880
yeah

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:37.380
I used to get REM like like crazy and

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.839
and you could tell it comes from the the

00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:43.020
this part of the brain that but your

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.720
brain isn't thinking it's just it's yeah

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.599
you're not allowing it to to make the

00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:51.300
sentences but it's still it's still

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.059
trying to run the show until that's

00:50:54.059 --> 00:50:56.220
that's the end of it this is actually

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.099
why we

00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:01.380
have this methodology for Collective

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.480
Insight practice

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.619
um

00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:07.880
cool AJ

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.020
um my brain is doing that I think right

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.720
now and

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.520
so uh

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.140
so then

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.359
I'm just describing the process I'm

00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:24.059
allowing myself then to speak it because

00:51:24.059 --> 00:51:28.079
maybe it is wanting to be spoken and

00:51:28.079 --> 00:51:29.400
it's Collective

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.020
maybe that's not the right

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.780
interpretation but

00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.079
I'm gonna go for it

00:51:37.079 --> 00:51:38.579
um

00:51:38.579 --> 00:51:41.400
what's going on in me is since the very

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.000
beginning I'm like collecting the words

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.800
I just can't help do this all the time

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:51.359
I'm like I know the topic I I'm like oh

00:51:51.359 --> 00:51:54.000
okay I'm putting original uh the body

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
together I know dance I found the answer

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.619
already I like I know yes

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.540
um between Holly and I we have it uh

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.420
but I said what she said

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:10.280
um

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.099
and uh then what I'm noticing is what

00:52:14.099 --> 00:52:16.319
you're doing here Barney

00:52:16.319 --> 00:52:19.319
is not even about

00:52:19.319 --> 00:52:22.099
the answer to the origin of the bunny

00:52:22.099 --> 00:52:26.099
it's it's uh you did say this to me back

00:52:26.099 --> 00:52:28.079
in the day that

00:52:28.079 --> 00:52:28.859
um

00:52:28.859 --> 00:52:32.339
you said something to the effect of you

00:52:32.339 --> 00:52:35.099
actually use these words you said saying

00:52:35.099 --> 00:52:38.220
something without saying it and

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.079
so you're you're just dropping

00:52:40.079 --> 00:52:43.319
breadcrumbs it feels like that we're

00:52:43.319 --> 00:52:45.960
like percolating in and then this

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:47.400
Collective insight

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.960
process is really

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.140
it's just it is an exercise in another

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.700
way of being

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:59.700
foreign

00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:06.720
this releases something in me while it

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.099
also frustrates

00:53:08.099 --> 00:53:10.859
because my orientation is to solve the

00:53:10.859 --> 00:53:13.920
problem and and to find the answer and

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.500
to speak and to say come on like don't

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.260
you don't you get it

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.380
we're not lost like Raj was saying you

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.480
know we're not lost like we know

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.700
actually what's going on uh versus uh a

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.380
process of

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.960
uh

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.780
exercising a whole other way of being

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:40.740
in the gaps that we have between each

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.540
other

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:46.140
the the gaps that allow life the gaps

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.339
that allow

00:53:47.339 --> 00:53:51.240
this kind of relationality

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.359
um

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.540
yeah I just

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.160
um yeah and it's disorienting so I

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:06.000
wanted to speak it because it's going in

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.980
yeah

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.520
okay

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.660
if only you had once said that you know

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.280
we're swimming in language like fish are

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.680
swimming in in an ocean and I'm

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.599
wondering if you think it's possible to

00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:51.500
swim in something else

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.579
yeah so

00:54:56.579 --> 00:54:59.000
so um

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:15.780
I mean I it's definitely possible

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.559
whether it is the

00:55:19.559 --> 00:55:23.160
all the actual trajectory of humanity

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.339
that as a whole

00:55:26.339 --> 00:55:28.460
um

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.619
is

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:33.740
um

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.619
probably

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.720
I don't know not the case I mean every

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.540
time I think like so we have like chat

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:44.819
GPT and

00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:47.040
um you would imagine that this would

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.260
exhaust

00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:51.660
you see part of part of these kinds of

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.240
practices is try to exhaust

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.960
the the monkey mind let's say or the

00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.940
discursive mind or the dialogical mind

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.339
or whatever

00:56:02.339 --> 00:56:06.420
um and you and so what Sandra was was

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.780
describing was that you know some some

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.220
of the physical

00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:17.579
experience of of finally decoupling from

00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:19.680
this this

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.440
organ this organ in the way it works

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:25.559
today so you never lose your mind it

00:56:25.559 --> 00:56:27.839
actually does cool cool things for you

00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:31.200
it can it just doesn't do these scripts

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.900
and this stuff

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.180
um so

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.540
um but

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.300
there's always I always wonder like how

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:47.099
much can humanity take like like we are

00:56:47.099 --> 00:56:49.680
uh so we're swimming in language and now

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.720
we have GPT and then that's going to be

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.760
language and then

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.800
um there's a chance that like this whole

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.319
trajectory will exhaust that human mind

00:56:58.319 --> 00:57:00.540
at a certain point anyways you know what

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:02.940
I mean I it's just it's just amazing to

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.500
me how much

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.260
the human system can endure it's just

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.300
it's just

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.400
um yeah

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.500
um and so in that case

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.900
um instead of this trajectory if you

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.480
watched my conversation with Soria that

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.579
was the one of the first points I made

00:57:20.579 --> 00:57:25.760
it's like we we go from you know

00:57:26.099 --> 00:57:30.300
oral to text to technology these all

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.339
have been they're on the same trajectory

00:57:32.339 --> 00:57:35.720
they all seem to have the same

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.760
bad code in them

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.579
um so how can we get off that trajectory

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:44.940
and move orthogonal to something new

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.839
um what would be we be swimming in then

00:57:48.839 --> 00:57:52.380
um I suppose it would be something new

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.640
um

00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:57.119
I don't know but it it also could be you

00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:59.160
know if we if we think about the whole

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.140
Human Experience a psychedelic you know

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.660
the Psychedelic self it might not be

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.480
something entirely new it might be how

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.880
the Psychedelic self just takes what you

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.460
have self-otherm world and rearranges it

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:14.579
right so it could be something like that

00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:16.859
that it's not entirely new but the the

00:58:16.859 --> 00:58:19.440
whole structure gets recomposed

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.599
differently

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:23.720
um

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.380
um so that

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.540
language is

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.900
uh

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.440
transparent to

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.980
to the question not seen as the solution

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.900
to the question I mean this is kind of

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:43.079
what we've been doing that we

00:58:43.079 --> 00:58:45.359
when we talk about epistemic complex

00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:48.599
constraints to the question we're making

00:58:48.599 --> 00:58:49.880
language

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.740
transparent to the question we're not

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.960
just diving in

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:57.599
to our ideas and working double down

00:58:57.599 --> 00:59:00.240
let's just double down on our Concepts

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.740
and work harder

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.440
okay and that that would be like a meta

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.900
systemic complexity until you get these

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:11.160
very big large sophisticated

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.799
um conceptual structures we're we're not

00:59:13.799 --> 00:59:16.200
doing that

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.299
um interestingly I mean

00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:23.819
it's also true for other very abstract

00:59:23.819 --> 00:59:26.099
um Pursuits like

00:59:26.099 --> 00:59:28.500
um I spend a lot of time watching and

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.799
thinking about Chess and you know the

00:59:31.799 --> 00:59:33.839
top chess players yeah they're great

00:59:33.839 --> 00:59:35.700
calculators and they have great memories

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:39.240
but at a certain point

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:41.299
um

00:59:41.339 --> 00:59:43.760
they just they just are pattern

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.079
recognizers and they just it's just a

00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:48.299
feeling they get this feels better than

00:59:48.299 --> 00:59:49.200
that

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.880
and blah blah blah blah and and so

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.099
there's there's a lot of Science in the

00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:57.960
fact that

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.319
um the feeling body the body that thinks

01:00:01.319 --> 01:00:04.740
through things thinks as the body is a

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:07.619
much more powerful engine uh than we can

01:00:07.619 --> 01:00:10.319
imagine and

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:12.440
um

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:16.859
and could the human identity let's say

01:00:16.859 --> 01:00:18.299
swim in that

01:00:18.299 --> 01:00:20.960
and then have language be

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.299
kind of accidental to that experience

01:00:24.299 --> 01:00:27.480
rather than language constraining the

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.000
experience of your body I mean think

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.180
about gender dysmorphia is language a

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.220
social construction constraining your

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.920
relationship to your own body it's so

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.760
upside down

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.180
so upside down

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.900
Kevin

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.220
that's how you finished did you have a

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.700
follow-up Holly no Kevin

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.700
yeah I'm wondering what you think about

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.680
um

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.099
like maybe bilingual children or just

01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:02.819
like

01:01:02.819 --> 01:01:04.859
you know because I think it's easy you

01:01:04.859 --> 01:01:06.599
know children at a certain age it's

01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:07.799
easier for them to learn multiple

01:01:07.799 --> 01:01:09.299
languages because of that

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:12.240
neuroplasticity and I'm wondering

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.799
um

01:01:13.799 --> 01:01:15.660
if like you know they kind of so they

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.520
kind of exist in this pre-language state

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.260
and I wonder if like

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.660
you know having two different sort of

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.819
language reality filters

01:01:23.819 --> 01:01:25.859
that they grow up in

01:01:25.859 --> 01:01:28.680
like possibly provides them with like

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.400
more access to that like pre-language

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.559
Consciousness just because I would

01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:37.200
imagine like if yeah you know

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.180
hypothetically like a child raised on

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.359
one language they kind of get more like

01:01:42.359 --> 01:01:43.980
stuck in that kind of language as

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.780
reality

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.400
um versus like a bilingual child child

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.920
they kind of see how like oh yeah

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.559
Spanish is different than English in

01:01:52.559 --> 01:01:54.119
this way or German is whatever different

01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:55.020
than

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.700
and then I wonder if that provides more

01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.380
possibilities in the future to like kind

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.660
of access this like oh language or

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:04.319
narrative business big universal truth

01:02:04.319 --> 01:02:06.420
um and then even like that could be

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.819
applied to other abstract ways of

01:02:08.819 --> 01:02:12.059
thinking that are not just language like

01:02:12.059 --> 01:02:12.720
um

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.180
like you know mathematics alongside

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.920
language

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.799
like when I was in a breakout room with

01:02:19.799 --> 01:02:21.720
um Katie and jolt and well Samuel too

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.180
but when Joe was speaking he kind of I I

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.220
noticed like

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.079
the he kind of speaks in like a

01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:30.240
mathematical structure

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.700
or not another way he speaks like the

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.980
way he used like the analogy is like

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.900
in the kind of same way that I did when

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.760
I talked about when I brought up my

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.400
experience of like having a cluster

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:43.500
like a constellation of verbs and then

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.260
he said like oh I'm like making a cue to

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.280
like

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.680
it I don't know but like it feels like

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.900
you know mathematics can kind of it's a

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.940
different it organizes a reality in kind

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.280
of a different structured abstract way

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.319
than a language does so I'm wondering

01:02:58.319 --> 01:03:00.960
like if this and I think so that that

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.359
Eagan book you reviewed I I happen to

01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:06.000
read it like last year and it kind of

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.339
yeah it kind of I think that's kind of

01:03:08.339 --> 01:03:09.599
what he's getting at with his like

01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.880
ironic understanding it's like you kind

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:15.020
of get these more philosophies this

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.579
philosophical understandings and then

01:03:17.579 --> 01:03:19.380
the ironic you know you kind of like

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.180
play these philosophical systems against

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:23.460
each other and

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.900
um I'm wondering if that kind of

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.180
different different modes of abstract

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.160
thinking can kind of help you

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.559
achieve that yeah everything you're

01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:35.280
saying is definitely what up the upshot

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:38.819
of what Ivan is is saying and

01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:41.040
um just to expand a little more in your

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.980
question so what he's saying is yes does

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.900
a certain phase when children learn

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:49.920
language uh really well he says there's

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.160
the the the fallacy in education today

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.640
is we think children are like adults

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.099
it's just everything all the skill sets

01:03:59.099 --> 01:04:02.579
are diminished right so so EV here's an

01:04:02.579 --> 01:04:04.380
adult and here's a child it's the same

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.380
template but less less inclined for all

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.960
of these things and he's saying no

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.900
there's times in childhood when these

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:17.280
skills come online and they outperform

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.400
I think I I put it in the notes as a as

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.160
a reply like the

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.400
the amount of uh loss of capacity

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.960
between a three-year-old the

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.940
six-year-old an 11 year old under with

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:32.579
certain skills is dramatic in a very

01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:34.680
short time they completely lose these

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.079
skills and this comes from the fact that

01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:38.880
people don't understand that this is

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.700
like a superpower in a very narrow

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.520
window of time and so instead of trying

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.720
to teach

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.839
everything an adult knows but like at a

01:04:48.839 --> 01:04:52.680
lesser kind of level of reality we

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.000
should augment this

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.819
god-given stage where

01:04:59.819 --> 01:05:02.520
um you can make the most of this that's

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.940
also the naturally arising interest of

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.819
the child okay so they're making up

01:05:08.819 --> 01:05:11.400
they're learning to speak so all these

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.880
mechanisms because all these mechanisms

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.220
are like really

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.319
firing right now

01:05:19.319 --> 01:05:23.579
and so what happens when you instead of

01:05:23.579 --> 01:05:25.500
saying okay here's a child he's an

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.540
English-speaking child let's just have

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.760
them learn to speak but it won't be as

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.680
complex as a what what if we gave him

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.819
the same book in three different

01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:38.160
languages with the same pictures

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.040
now this would be hard for an adult to

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.960
do so you wouldn't think of doing that

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.640
but actually

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.859
they just assume you know I mean they

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:49.380
don't live in maybe a Sanskrit speaking

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.599
but what if it was like a Sanskrit text

01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:54.119
a different culture translated and wrote

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:58.799
they could easily start to see the the

01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:00.000
different

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.460
um words and semantics and stuff like

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.500
that it'd be easier for them because

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.720
that's what they can do at that stage

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:09.000
and if we imagine if I imagine myself

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.940
doing it they like you know

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:15.359
look forget that it's because I would be

01:06:15.359 --> 01:06:17.339
trying to transliterate everything you

01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:19.319
know there's certain capacities we have

01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:23.180
that get cold so then

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.819
um it's not only obviously they might

01:06:26.819 --> 01:06:29.579
just eventually being be fluent only in

01:06:29.579 --> 01:06:32.579
one language but something has some

01:06:32.579 --> 01:06:35.400
template of the human capacity has

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.859
really been augmented

01:06:37.859 --> 01:06:40.500
um in ways that then

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.640
um will be helpful helpful later so yeah

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.680
you're absolutely right in what you're

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.599
saying and

01:06:48.599 --> 01:06:50.880
um uh

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.940
this is easier to do in bilingual or

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:56.400
trilingual households obviously because

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.579
because now you have that cognitive

01:06:59.579 --> 01:07:01.920
capacity embedded in something so

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:04.380
natural family life that you have a

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.220
double

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.960
positive

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960
um but it certainly could be done more

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.440
augmented more in school so

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.900
um you know so you know the point is we

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.599
try to get kids to read

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:19.380
um

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:21.380
um

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.960
yeah the whole thing is it's because we

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.480
don't understand the miracle reading so

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.839
every every generation we turn it into a

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:33.299
formula we make the book simpler you

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.980
know if you look at what 11 year olds

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.859
were reading in England you know in the

01:07:37.859 --> 01:07:42.299
1500s it's like most American adults uh

01:07:42.299 --> 01:07:44.819
can't read those books they don't have

01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:47.039
the linguistic of a cognitive capacity

01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:50.460
to understand the sentence structure

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.740
um so

01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.520
um

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.619
yeah

01:07:55.619 --> 01:07:58.680
something like something like

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.839
uh

01:08:00.839 --> 01:08:04.680
59 of only of the adult population in

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.240
the United States

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.000
uh knows that the earth goes around the

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.260
Sun

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.380
and only 29 of

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.160
um

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.920
of people in the United States think

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:19.799
genes exist in vegetables that are not

01:08:19.799 --> 01:08:21.000
GMO

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.759
they think only GMO vegetables have

01:08:23.759 --> 01:08:25.319
genes

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:29.100
school does not even even if you only

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.060
wanted it to do like download facts

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:36.719
for people it does not do what uh it

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:39.839
purports to do this was if you those of

01:08:39.839 --> 01:08:42.480
you in The Parallax course this was the

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.179
consumer Ed Guy Brian Kaplan he's like

01:08:45.179 --> 01:08:47.640
why would a commentary spend 4.2

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.880
trillion dollars in education and its

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:54.839
own researchers have these facts

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:57.480
that that kids don't people don't know

01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:59.000
these facts

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.500
it doesn't he's an economist and he's

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.339
like it doesn't make economic sense no

01:09:04.339 --> 01:09:06.660
any other industry would have gone out

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.620
of business

01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.020
if that was you know the more more and

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.179
more money you make the stupider and

01:09:12.179 --> 01:09:13.920
stupid results you would get you know

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:16.020
evidence-based education doesn't exist

01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.719
so he's and then his point is is

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:21.779
the U.S pays Four Points two trillion

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:23.640
dollars on education for different

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.859
purposes and they're getting their

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:27.839
money's worth for those purposes that's

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:30.480
his hypothesis

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.140
um

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.799
but

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.660
that's weird that you read that book

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.920
it's not a very well-known book

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.179
apparently

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:44.219
yeah

01:09:44.219 --> 01:09:47.040
I just wanted to share with the like the

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.900
discussion on language

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.100
um

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.040
I've gotten to learn languages one when

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.780
I was like a teenager and then another

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.900
in my like throughout my 20s and

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.280
something that's been really cool about

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.620
it or like a like a big Insight that

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.000
kind of came from it kind of like Kevin

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.679
was talking about

01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:07.260
like breaking down

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.420
the the frames through which the world

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.760
is organized and bringing you back to

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:14.280
some kind of direct perception or like

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.440
memory or other

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.080
there's a there's a couple ways that it

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.340
does this one the entire language

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.500
learning process

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.960
um

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.520
is one of communicating people when you

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.500
don't share a verbal language

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:30.239
um I'm like trying to figure out all

01:10:30.239 --> 01:10:31.860
kinds of symbols and like pointing and

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.840
like making sure that you're seeing eye

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:37.500
to eye in ways that have nothing to do

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.140
with the words that are being spoken

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:42.719
um and then the word becomes a symbol

01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:44.460
that you learn and point to once you've

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.739
already

01:10:45.739 --> 01:10:47.640
recognized that you have a shared

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.739
communication and that's the only like

01:10:49.739 --> 01:10:51.780
that's how that happens so it completely

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.580
changes your orientation

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:57.239
to communication or for me anyway it did

01:10:57.239 --> 01:10:57.840
um

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.540
and then the second thing too is

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:03.120
realizing that um as you try to

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.219
translate for other people between

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.900
languages who maybe speak one or the

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.400
other

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.440
um

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.540
that

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:15.719
translation is not a direct process

01:11:15.719 --> 01:11:16.860
um because even if you're talking about

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.739
simple nouns the connotations in one

01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:21.179
language or another or the connections

01:11:21.179 --> 01:11:23.940
that are made in like the network of

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:28.199
of of words are are interrelated with

01:11:28.199 --> 01:11:29.880
completely different things so like a

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.800
example like kind of funny is um

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.320
like I had a a Spanish-speaking friend

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.060
asked me like how do you say umbiligo

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.320
which means belly button not really

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.640
Naval but it has this connotation of

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.739
like depth and like connection to Source

01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:47.960
it's like

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:51.360
and I was like looking for I was like

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.860
belly button and we were just laughing

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.480
our asses off because this is absolutely

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.760
not the thing and like that's a really

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.600
extreme example but even like even the

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.980
subtlest

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.900
yeah anyway yeah you know

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:09.480
this there's languages we swim in

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.400
language but this is you're saying a lot

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:14.040
of things that are very important and

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.659
that is

01:12:15.659 --> 01:12:16.340
um

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.860
uh once once you start to investigate

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.300
language either through something like

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.300
that if motion were here he he talks

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:25.620
about how

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:27.719
if you're really fluent in two languages

01:12:27.719 --> 01:12:29.460
you don't translate you live in this

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:30.900
language or you live in that language

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.120
and you're a different person and then

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.159
when you're translating you have to you

01:12:35.159 --> 01:12:38.400
have to make choices so if like in the

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.980
story they all celebrated and went out

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.219
and ate termite larvas and you were

01:12:44.219 --> 01:12:45.900
you're Translating that into a

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.460
children's book you'd have to say they

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:49.620
went to Carvel's or something which is

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.560
not at all a translation right

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.120
so then you start to think and I mean

01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:59.880
all psycho Technologies all this

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:05.340
Awakening 99 of it is you know getting

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.000
through the mental

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.560
content but the mental content is

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.900
linguistically constructed so between

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.280
people then you have this language

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.960
problem

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.320
or or potential but the other thing is

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.560
what you're saying is in order to use

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.320
language between two people and

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.040
communicate you already have to have

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.520
already know the context

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.739
ninety percent of what you're going to

01:13:34.739 --> 01:13:36.840
communicate already has to be shared

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.080
before you can use the language for it

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:43.199
so then where does the understanding

01:13:43.199 --> 01:13:45.120
come from the meaning is not in the

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.100
words I know David you're going to

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.080
cringe but I'm telling you

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.440
there the meaning is not in the words

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:55.500
the words are like if I point to this

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.800
book

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.980
right the the the finger is not the book

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.380
and then if I say book

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.440
the word book is not the book all

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.040
language is are pointing out things so

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.620
if I say

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.260
LGBT I pointed out a whole big thing

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.580
already

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:21.000
the whole social thing and the social

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.820
media and and you know what I'm saying

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:27.420
I've just said one word it's a trigger

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.880
for all these meaning making systems in

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.420
you that I shared but it's not in the

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.640
word the word is a trigger like the

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.760
point two things so

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.520
um now there are some abstractions that

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.260
start to become not at all like that

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.000
they just point to other abstractions

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
and other abstractions so so

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.040
um in order to have a shared context you

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.500
bet you need to run a very complex

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.620
simulation with another person so if I'm

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.020
doing really high math with someone and

01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.820
they're they're just saying all these

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.199
words these these these these uh symbols

01:15:04.199 --> 01:15:06.840
the symbols are compressions that

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.600
trigger all this stuff that you don't

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.480
have to say one plus one plus one one

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.640
plus one plus one plus one plus one one

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.480
I can say five okay I compress that we

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:21.540
can move on so

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:24.440
um they're actually action protocols

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.380
words produce actions that then run

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.420
Downstream

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.840
um and the actions

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.640
um so

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.480
um

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.780
one of the things about

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.179
so this is going meta on the question

01:15:42.179 --> 01:15:46.140
right of of what language is but

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.719
then it becomes fascinating if meaning's

01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:53.159
not in the word then where is it

01:15:53.159 --> 01:15:55.739
um or where does it come from

01:15:55.739 --> 01:15:59.280
um and like you said there it comes from

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:02.340
uh a couple of things we have a basic

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.040
human template so there's a lot that's

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.800
already shared right I mean there's we

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.520
have to breathe we have to eat we see

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.500
life and death you know so something

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:17.760
even if you go into that

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.580
tribe where they that was in that book

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:23.480
you know those snake's bite or something

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.900
there's some fundamentals shared

01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:30.659
um syntax of just being a human in front

01:16:30.659 --> 01:16:32.760
of a human it's also why you can talk to

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.400
animals there's a shared syntax and then

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.020
you build up more and more and more

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.900
shared sin tax

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.760
um until the possibility of

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.560
communication

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.940
um is seamless and easy and

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.260
um

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.760
seems to be in the words

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.340
um I would love to understand what uh

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:11.179
shared syntax

01:17:11.179 --> 01:17:15.300
actually means so that's one question I

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.659
post but I also want to go back to this

01:17:18.659 --> 01:17:20.940
is why I raised my hand to what Holly

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:22.400
was asking

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.620
what I heard in her question was we went

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.440
the language way which probably was

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.620
necessary she was asking

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.320
are we swimming in something else as we

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.719
swim in language that's what I heard

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:43.199
uh and that is a very interesting

01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:45.480
question to me because you know I am one

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:47.520
of those I grew up in Turkey learned

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.100
French when I was little was sent to a

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.540
boarding school in England learned

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.780
English

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:54.960
etc

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:55.920
etc

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.500
living in multiple contexts I had

01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:02.940
um the opportunity to develop different

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.800
perspectives

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.199
because of the exposure I got language

01:18:07.199 --> 01:18:08.640
and context

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.400
at the same time I was the kind of child

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:14.100
who was already wondering about

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.500
what's the reason of existence in the

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.600
universe you know age

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.300
eight solenoids

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.440
um

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.580
so then was I

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.380
blessed with the life I was which was

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:30.540
not easy I told it was not life or

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.140
blessing but

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.540
um but was I you know then equipped with

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.100
these tools uh because of what I already

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.020
was the energy or the

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.060
the the

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:50.760
what I don't know that is the that is

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.000
the question I'm most interested in

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.080
um

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.159
or did I then develop you know larger

01:18:59.159 --> 01:19:03.780
capacity uh cognitive capacity or larger

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:07.199
capacity to take more perspectives

01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:10.739
because of the these exterior things

01:19:10.739 --> 01:19:13.560
like I learned languages I I had

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.540
exposure

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.659
um

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.260
yeah my sense is that

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.699
or

01:19:23.699 --> 01:19:26.880
it is it's it's a confusing place for me

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.920
because

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.980
um

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.600
um I find myself getting frustrated

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:38.820
giving the credit to these external

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.159
things like oh I learned the language

01:19:41.159 --> 01:19:44.580
and that's why I I cannot take more

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:47.040
perspectives like that's as if we can

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:49.800
these do these mechanical things to

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.340
human beings and then these things can

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.179
then happen

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.739
um

01:19:58.739 --> 01:20:01.140
feels like

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.260
um

01:20:04.199 --> 01:20:06.840
it gets me stuck when I go in that

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.920
direction of thinking

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.480
um all right so there's a lot here I'm

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.040
just gonna make a couple of them easy

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:17.340
when I say syntax just think of the word

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:19.500
context

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.739
syntax is the language what context is

01:20:22.739 --> 01:20:25.159
to

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.199
just regular life

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:31.620
right so I might have the same word as

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.860
you do for

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:39.480
uh termite larva but in one context in

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.400
the sentence in one syntax in the

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.080
sentence it's a happy thing and another

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.260
syntax it's it's like a bummer I had to

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.199
eat termite larva so syntax to languages

01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:52.080
like the context

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.780
to just ordinary life or something

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.420
that's that that's easy way so what are

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.520
we swimming in I'm going to think of um

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.500
uh Jill's Henry uh he says you know

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:07.860
again we we go to the child because when

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:10.199
we think of the typical adult most

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:14.100
adults unlike people on this uh group

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.719
um they get pretty situated and don't

01:21:15.719 --> 01:21:18.540
learn anymore I mean in general

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.820
um but

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.860
um

01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:25.020
humans are polyphasic Learners and this

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.600
is both a blessing and a problem so what

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.940
do we mean by that

01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:32.040
if you're the teacher is telling me

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.400
something

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.020
um and okay I'll give you the example he

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.940
gives Johnny's asked to go to the board

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:42.480
and write out a mathematical formula

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.120
that he's supposed to learn and as he's

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:49.080
doing it he's learning he's on the face

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.900
of it he's learning this algebra but

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.719
he's also learning that you know the

01:21:54.719 --> 01:21:56.520
teacher picked on him and he might be

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.800
laughed at if the kids are there and he

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.100
stumbles so he's learning the context we

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.699
can say and and and the important thing

01:22:05.699 --> 01:22:10.340
is that that's actually what children

01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:13.260
remember more from school than the

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:14.880
content

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.820
um and and what we do is we diminish the

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.800
context so it's an unlearning situation

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.260
and what people learn Johnny's learning

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.659
is a competition that there's only one

01:22:24.659 --> 01:22:26.940
right answer and if the kids in the

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.460
class help him when he when he makes a

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.140
mistake that's called chill cheating

01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:34.199
this is this because it has so much more

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:36.780
it's more relevant to him at his life

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:40.020
stage than abstract math this is what he

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.219
will learn

01:22:41.219 --> 01:22:44.640
so we're always swimming in more than

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.500
this language

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.179
but

01:22:48.179 --> 01:22:50.719
it has to do with

01:22:50.719 --> 01:22:54.780
what our conscious identity is so most

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.460
people's Consciousness conscious

01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.239
identity is swimming in language so they

01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:03.300
don't actually consciously experience

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.820
the disconnect between what they're

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.280
learning at the polyphasic level and the

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.960
language

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:13.500
so their bodies will know there's a

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.840
disconnect and they have stress and they

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.179
get addicted and they have ulcers and

01:23:18.179 --> 01:23:19.800
they're angry and their emotional system

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.480
is a mess

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.760
because there's a disconnect the forces

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.120
are at odds with each other so the fact

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.159
that the polyphasic learning is always

01:23:29.159 --> 01:23:30.120
there

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.320
is one thing but what happens when we're

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.900
swimming in language it produces a

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:39.600
certain type of subjectivity that is

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:41.580
linguistically

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.940
focused and the language aspect is

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.940
hypertrophic

01:23:48.179 --> 01:23:49.860
so

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.860
um so uh

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.920
certain Society the language might be so

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.780
disconnected it does no longer

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.840
represents the actual positive

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.480
polyphasic reality and so now you have

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:07.679
this this kind of disease or mental

01:24:07.679 --> 01:24:09.480
Madness

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:14.179
um so most people are

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.100
you know they even think subjectivity is

01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:20.219
dialogical and they think uh awareness

01:24:20.219 --> 01:24:22.739
is dialogical and that thinking is

01:24:22.739 --> 01:24:24.480
thoughts in your head is linguistically

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.580
they think gender is socially

01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.219
constructed and they you know there's

01:24:29.219 --> 01:24:30.600
there's

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.060
so even people that would never say that

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.880
they go around their identity is a

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.860
narrative that they've constructed

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.420
there's a linguistically constructed

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.520
identity at a certain phase that's

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:47.420
appropriate but there this is this is

01:24:47.659 --> 01:24:50.460
gets us further and further or what we

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.820
we have the multiple dimensions of what

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.699
reality is saying to us is getting so

01:24:56.699 --> 01:24:59.520
that that it's not coherent it's not

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.800
it's not coherent

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.460
um and so

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:07.980
um so to that extent most of society

01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.040
swimming in language and the problem is

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.260
they could never say something like what

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.260
Katie said that language is kind of

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.840
weird actually it's not

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.360
yes it has the power that you're saying

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.800
it has because everyone's swimming in

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.239
language and nobody can see what

01:25:24.239 --> 01:25:25.500
language is

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.780
uh I haven't already talked about this

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.060
you know language is a powerful tool and

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:32.760
like other tools it can be uh you know

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.239
it can enhance our experience it can

01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:38.340
um it can

01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.699
um uh take over our experience it can

01:25:41.699 --> 01:25:43.199
control our experience and it can

01:25:43.199 --> 01:25:45.360
destroy our experience

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.040
so

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.420
um now

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.120
the problem and and I always say this

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.260
the it it's it's the problem in our

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:57.060
society

01:25:57.060 --> 01:26:01.739
the late stage capitalism is that uh

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:05.280
most of the opportunities to contribute

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.860
to society make a living

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.800
um even this class is

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.320
um to compound linguistic structures

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.780
right I mean hopefully what I do is I

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.580
destroy them

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.320
I mean

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.540
um but but

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:25.080
um and so so the material conditions of

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.179
your life also

01:26:27.179 --> 01:26:27.960
um

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:30.480
contribute to thinking that language is

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.060
special because because it actually

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.580
you know puts fear puts food on your

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.320
table let's say

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.179
um so

01:26:39.179 --> 01:26:40.920
uh

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:44.100
this is this is a problem

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:46.219
um

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.620
it's why there's a lot of pressure when

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:50.940
I first told people we're doing

01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.739
Collective Insight practice it's not

01:26:52.739 --> 01:26:55.679
conversational not talking to each other

01:26:55.679 --> 01:26:58.580
full stop makes you nervous

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:02.520
uh and like I said you know I took a

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:05.639
chance it's kind of rude but but we can

01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:08.159
reclaim languages but it's no longer our

01:27:08.159 --> 01:27:10.460
master

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.900
um it's it's it's

01:27:30.719 --> 01:27:33.659
and you know there's different

01:27:33.659 --> 01:27:36.000
insights into it I don't know if

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.960
madalina this was part this is what I

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:42.000
either projected or inflected or

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.100
inferred him what what you were talking

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:46.820
about but

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.980
um

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:55.400
but it it's something that I I

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.080
encountered so some kind of mashup

01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.000
between

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.139
madalina's experience in my own

01:28:01.139 --> 01:28:03.120
experience like it's taken on its own

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:08.460
kind of mixed story here but

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:09.420
um

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:12.239
so when I was working in landscape

01:28:12.239 --> 01:28:14.460
architecture there was this woman who

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.860
was a designer and she was a really hard

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:18.540
worker but she wasn't that like

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.920
conceptually smart I mean she

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.020
like really was into space and

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:27.300
Aesthetics and movement and machines and

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.520
stuff and she'd come in and she's like I

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.800
have an idea and I was the operations

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.719
manager so you're not at these big like

01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:35.460
schedules and you had to move this and

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:37.080
all this stuff

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.659
and quite often she'd come in and her

01:28:39.659 --> 01:28:43.440
idea was very good but it was always

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.659
single perspective her and her client

01:28:45.659 --> 01:28:48.420
and the way her work her and she didn't

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.100
understand how there's a whole lot more

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.440
because those contractors can't come in

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.179
until after this and then the permanent

01:28:54.179 --> 01:28:55.739
and these guys got to be you know all

01:28:55.739 --> 01:28:57.239
this stuff I was looking at this

01:28:57.239 --> 01:28:59.400
multiple grid

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.040
and so she was very feisty and we would

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.500
have a fight and she would say something

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.120
and I would say and then she'd get

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.920
louder and it would sound like a fight

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:12.360
and I learned that then she would like

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.780
just and then walk out but

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.060
if I never said oh I told you so and I

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:20.580
which I never did you I noticed she

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.940
would then do what I said and one day I

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.860
was in the middle of this typical scene

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:30.120
with her it was just a pattern

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.400
and right in the middle just before like

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.320
it was already coming out of my mouth

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.420
and I was when you know it would be the

01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.340
end of that and she'd walk out

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.380
I realized I was wrong

01:29:42.659 --> 01:29:46.199
because I was multi-perspectival and she

01:29:46.199 --> 01:29:48.659
had this other perspective

01:29:48.659 --> 01:29:51.480
that was maybe single perspective but it

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.540
had information in it that I didn't see

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:58.199
and so what I realized right then and

01:29:58.199 --> 01:30:01.500
there is just because you're smarter

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.840
doesn't mean you're right

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.699
number one

01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:08.280
and number two if you've spent your

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:09.620
whole life

01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:12.060
defending yourself because you're

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.560
smarter

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:16.620
from various insults

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.800
that come at you in the world and then

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.340
you realize that words don't matter you

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.620
have to break down and cry when you're

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:29.179
asked not to use words

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.860
because then what matters

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:36.300
if they don't really

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:41.040
this is my my superpower

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:46.159
than what matters and then you can

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:51.440
encounter or touch base with the energy

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.580
that's actually

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.400
you've been surviving by the words don't

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.500
really matter

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.100
for energy

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:06.000
so uh

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.739
so this is the this is many levels of uh

01:31:10.739 --> 01:31:14.159
meta around language but then also this

01:31:14.159 --> 01:31:16.260
very

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:19.679
way that

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:21.780
even when you

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.820
the pressure that something like

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.739
Collective Insight practice can put on

01:31:25.739 --> 01:31:28.320
people because we've actually used

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.219
language as a tool

01:31:32.219 --> 01:31:35.280
um and

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:39.300
become a little deluded about where the

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.120
actual source of the power

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:45.960
or the intimacy comes from

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.060
either the defensive power or the

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:52.280
intimacy where where it comes from

01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:54.440
um

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.540
so the only thing that happens then is

01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:00.060
you touch base where where the power and

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.179
the intimacy comes from

01:32:02.179 --> 01:32:06.780
and uh you know that that

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.639
then it just makes

01:32:08.639 --> 01:32:10.980
your superpower you can still be very

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:13.080
intellectual you can still be very

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.360
social but it doesn't cost you as much

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.480
effort because now you're congruent now

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:21.480
your body now you really know your

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.760
body's not saying but it's not that but

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.139
it's not that

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.360
you know it's the flow through the whole

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:28.860
system

01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:31.260
what comes out of your mouth hardly

01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:33.480
matters

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:36.300
it's as long as it's shaped by the

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.040
intention and so this is actually what

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.020
Collective Insight practices except it's

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:43.440
hard for us to all be absorbed by the

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:45.320
intention of having to write a chapter

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.020
on the origins right but

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:49.739
um

01:32:49.739 --> 01:32:53.400
um yeah so all of this is in play all of

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.260
this is in play

01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:55.980
um

01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:59.760
it it looks like you know if I had to

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.699
create a Taoist short story and you saw

01:33:02.699 --> 01:33:04.440
like

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.179
um

01:33:06.179 --> 01:33:09.120
this huge guy you know two two samurais

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:11.159
meet themselves on the bridge

01:33:11.159 --> 01:33:13.280
in this huge God

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:17.159
one's a huge guy one's a little guy

01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:19.560
and the little guys you know

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.139
he has to show up and he's nervous so

01:33:22.139 --> 01:33:24.239
the little guy

01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:28.380
decides he's going to bring a huge

01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:30.360
samurai sword

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.300
right and the big guy brings a regular

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.600
samurai sword and and and because the

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:40.260
little guy thinks that the sword you

01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:43.800
know that the sword is the weapon

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:44.719
um

01:33:44.719 --> 01:33:48.179
and you know so the big guys there with

01:33:48.179 --> 01:33:51.960
his sword and the little guy's jerk

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.199
jacking his sword on

01:33:55.199 --> 01:33:58.219
on the bridge

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:02.100
and he turns around and

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:07.320
he's holding the sword and he's and

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:10.260
he confronts the big guy and the big guy

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.179
gets scared and runs away and then the

01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:14.100
master says no it wasn't the sword it

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:16.620
was the belief in the sword

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:19.020
um that scared with the master right and

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.600
so that's that's like

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:25.560
um yeah there's there's the power is

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.900
there the intimacy is there or the will

01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:31.860
to survive or some kind of power is

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:34.020
there and

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.800
um that's the shared syntax or context

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.560
that's communicated polyphasic to the

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:40.840
other

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.360
[Music]

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:46.460
um and the rest is Tai Chi with words

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:48.420
so

01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.440
um

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.760
yeah

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:54.139
so uh

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.219
it's something that that okay here's the

01:34:59.219 --> 01:35:01.139
perfect example it's something that

01:35:01.139 --> 01:35:03.120
Donald Trump knows

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.920
doesn't care what the he says

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.139
that's not where the communication is

01:35:07.139 --> 01:35:09.679
coming from

01:35:20.219 --> 01:35:22.800
so that is what we swim in the other

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.000
thing other than the language yes

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.639
but where is your identity is is

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.960
I heard you say to the degree that we

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.760
are identifying

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.280
with this

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.620
two-dimensional surface

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:49.620
existence

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:53.520
or three-dimensional surface

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:56.040
uh I don't even know what the weather

01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:57.360
spread

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.719
um that language creates this language

01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:04.560
is it's not it's like the belly button

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.400
is the language and the other word that

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.159
that suggests the

01:36:11.159 --> 01:36:13.739
the subtle depth

01:36:13.739 --> 01:36:17.340
reaction to thesaurus is this field that

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.560
you're talking about

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.560
okay

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.520
or I know I called it feels like I don't

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.380
know

01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.420
it's it's the other ways in which we

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.580
learn we learn

01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:34.500
um

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.120
here's a great one of the great

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.840
questions is is what would a I put it in

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.100
there no I can't I probably won't be

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.139
able to remember in the article he says

01:36:43.139 --> 01:36:46.219
what would a

01:36:46.219 --> 01:36:49.520
deaf mute

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.320
three-year-old a deaf mute human

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.400
who hasn't learned to sign what could a

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.159
deaf human who hasn't learned to sign or

01:37:08.159 --> 01:37:09.179
read

01:37:09.179 --> 01:37:12.060
uh illness okay what would an illiterate

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.580
deaf mute human

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.460
who hasn't learned to sign be able to do

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:20.719
more than a chimpanzee

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.960
and it turns out to be a lot

01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.480
a lot because of this polyphasic because

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.480
of these CR so we're mimetic we're

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.280
curious about other people we're

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.739
embedded in culture in a way all these

01:37:37.739 --> 01:37:41.460
ways and the child does a whole lot more

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:44.460
the illiterate deaf mute

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.860
human who can't sign does a lot more

01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.659
than a chimpanzee

01:37:48.659 --> 01:37:53.219
so uh this is the the somatic

01:37:53.219 --> 01:37:55.739
um even at the level of the somatic and

01:37:55.739 --> 01:37:59.699
mimetic uh there's a lot there's a can

01:37:59.699 --> 01:38:01.860
be a lot more going on if we don't

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:03.659
diminish it

01:38:03.659 --> 01:38:05.940
the problem is we educated out of

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:08.300
children

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.920
and the interesting thing is the

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.860
opposite that you can Google there is a

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:24.480
case of a woman

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:26.820
who was born

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.980
um and her parents put her in a closet

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:33.000
for something like 17 years

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:33.960
um

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:38.100
so she was you know she she

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.719
um and then they rescued her and they

01:38:39.719 --> 01:38:42.840
would could not rehabilitate her

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.960
um not because she like couldn't make

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:48.480
sounds or had these birth defects but

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.980
she didn't have any

01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:51.480
she didn't learn any of this other

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.620
polyphasic stuff

01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.520
she was a diminished person not only a

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.920
diminished person but she could not even

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.620
she wasn't even a healthy animal you

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.060
know what I'm saying and she wasn't like

01:39:06.060 --> 01:39:08.400
a happy pet or something like that she

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.199
was

01:39:10.199 --> 01:39:11.580
yeah

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:14.179
uh

01:39:16.739 --> 01:39:20.400
oh God it's 12 it's 2 15 already my bars

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:25.739
my barn student doc my dogs didn't bark

01:39:25.739 --> 01:39:28.980
see you knew what I said my bargs didn't

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.600
dock

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.139
um yes this was great it went fast it

01:39:34.139 --> 01:39:36.239
was a great debrief on the work we did

01:39:36.239 --> 01:39:40.080
earlier and uh yeah this is a funny

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.940
schedule because the Thursday Saturday

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:44.100
with this long break in between there's

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:46.020
some exciting things coming around the

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.820
Horizon really soon

01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:51.000
uh we don't want to tell you

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.600
um but uh we are we are

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:58.199
um pretty deep into securing uh Retreat

01:39:58.199 --> 01:40:01.199
dates for 2024

01:40:01.199 --> 01:40:03.480
um so

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:05.940
stay tuned

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.100
um yeah and all the notifications go

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.139
through the pop-up school so you will

01:40:10.139 --> 01:40:12.179
surely see them

01:40:12.179 --> 01:40:15.920
okay have a great day



## Cohort 4

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.799
hello everybody how are

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.200
you I'm

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.960
sick I had this horse workshop and 18

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.720
people stayed in the Airbnb and two

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.480
stayed at my house and the two stayed at

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.240
my

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.760
house came down from another conference

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880
and they had

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.439
Co I don't think I have coid I think I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.119
have a cold um but

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.879
uh I feel okay it's just like a cold

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.160
except that uh my brain my brain is not

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.760
my brain no work too

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.920
good

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
so gota help me have to help me out

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.199
isn't that what Collective Insight is

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.480
for yes when someone's brain no

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.640
work uh let's see gotta change

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.879
this see that

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.960
okay um

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.320
so let's just open it up with uh what's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.960
been going on what have you been

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.119
thinking about this this

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.759
question uh do you find it curious that

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.799
we don't have an origin

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.240
story

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.720
um yeah what's what's been going

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.040
on and I do have some things to say but

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.280
I just want to piggy back

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.439
afterwards I guess I'll go I did the I

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.360
think the second one or the third one or

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.600
maybe the first one where we we did it

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040
um the collective Insight I think it was

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.479
my first

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.960
time I remember just feeling frustrated

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.640
and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.759
like

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.479
um

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.320
but I remember it kind of made me

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.119
because I think what was the question it

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.360
was like what is reality or something of

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.880
the sort

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.039
what was the origin maybe that was it

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.039
but I remember having a period in my

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.399
like early

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.520
20s of feeling that a feeling that a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.200
question of like where do I come from

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.920
and that for me I remember was being it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.120
was a big

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.160
question like where do I come from like

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.840
is it my Heritage like you know like

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920
Irish polish that kind of thing or is it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.840
something

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.360
else

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.800
um yeah I don't know

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.840
yeah I don't know what that was but that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.239
felt I don't know relevant I gu or

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.160
similar in the similar

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.920
vein yeah Collective Insight practice is

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.879
trying to kind of recapture like when

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.840
you're younger you just kind of feel the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.760
question and you can feel your

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.200
idea is moving around a little but it's

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.120
more like you just keep feeling the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.760
Contours of the question you know

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.040
because little kids they're not they

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.879
don't have a lot of answers to like to

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.560
suck into the question um they just have

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.080
this this the questions move like if you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.280
ever talk to a little kid then they'll

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.080
say why this or why you know the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.879
questions move just like when you have a

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.239
sore back and M is working on it um and

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.319
so that's a little bit

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.680
of um very similar

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.319
to um yeah I love that I didn't never

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.879
thought of it before but it is similar

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.200
to the kind of feeling space that

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.519
Collective Insight practice could and

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.439
should put you

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.959
in yeah I know I actually remember one

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.720
more thing after I think maybe a week

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.159
after I did that practice with

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.000
you I remember like for

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.560
me the tendency has been like whenever I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.760
think of the question what is reality it

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.560
feels very

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.479
meaningful um so I remember asking that

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.560
question afterwards but

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.160
then also what came up was what is

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.840
connection and that almost

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.240
seemed like the first step for me

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.639
because I know for me like connect

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.520
feeling connection with other people the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.800
the world around me just feeling

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.520
connected almost felt like more of

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.759
a like a base a baser thing I need to do

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.080
first or something it just feels and

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080
then reality would come that bigger

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.560
question that's I don't know that seems

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.680
to be what is

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.560
happening

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.560
yeah I made it for one of them as well

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.360
it might have been the second I think

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.199
um also my first time I was excited to

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.280
get to try out uh Collective Insight

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.840
practice my first time doing it you know

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.960
I mean the question was there but I just

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.639
totally dropped it and I was I was

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.600
really just trying to get out of the way

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.280
and uh you know let my my body

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.199
spontaneously Express whatever it wanted

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.680
to express which was it's always intense

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.560
there was a lot of energy um but it it

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.560
was a little confusing it was

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.759
interesting so you know I don't feel

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.160
like I really came close to the question

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.600
again throughout that first session at

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.120
least I want to practice this more I'm

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.199
eager to but one of the things that um

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.800
was sort of with me after the discussion

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.440
we had uh afterwards and thinking about

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440
the model and I remember there was a

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.759
moment when Bonnie mentioned um the

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.360
non-duality of the tears of joy and and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.440
sadness joy and grief it's the same

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.960
water it's the same salt

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.280
but when the notion of something like a

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.840
compound individual came up or that

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.520
there's there's a kind of collective

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.240
Insight that's happening now whether we

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.440
fuse into some like meta modad I mean

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.240
I've been the thing about Seaman Don

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.360
quite a bit and if there's something

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.479
kind of like transductive that's

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.759
happening in the space when we're

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.840
leaping into this but the nonduality of

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.360
going deep and going high seem to come

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.720
to me like if if Collective Insight is

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.800
like if if it's a higher intelligence

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.960
that's emerging we get there because

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.919
we're just trying to touch bottom

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.400
together that's what it feels like to me

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.639
so it it's in some ways I don't is there

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.639
a difference between going up and going

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.880
down or is it really just the same thing

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.160
um so this is what is very productive

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.360
about Collective Insight practice it

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.599
should

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.120
reveal the framework Within which you're

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.319
operating right and so so then you

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.160
you're yeah so that's that's why is I'm

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.919
and when I worked with the first frame

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.800
for example I'm like well what is going

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.759
up if going deeper is there what is

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.879
going up and then I hear Veri and Greg

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.479
Enriquez and they're like well it's it's

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.639
chat gp4 and more and more sharing of

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:26.080
information and I'm saying that's not a

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.800
compound individual that's something

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.440
else and and yet sometimes when they say

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.759
higher they are talking about something

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.520
like God which could be the Ultimate

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.840
Compound individual so I'm trying to

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.000
separate like make this discussion like

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.479
what's arising of these multiple

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:45.440
frames

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.159
that like exactly what you say like um

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.680
they seem to make sense in casual

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.720
conversation but when they start to

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.800
render themselves transparent you kind

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.560
of want to figure out what works work

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.879
they're doing right they're doing a

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:03.560
certain kind of work

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.000
um and um so that's why I started this

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.039
with like when you think of something

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.000
like origins or reality you quickly

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.479
start to first uh expose epistemic

00:08:17.479 --> 00:08:22.599
constraints or this this framing

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:26.360
problem yeah this map that

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.319
we that we no longer actually understand

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:31.879
and and we see that it's made ad hoc

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:34.399
it's very ad

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:37.800
hoc he doesn't have the problem he just

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.360
bark not a frame of reference

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.000
unfortunately stop um

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.240
so does that make

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.360
sense to your experience a

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.200
little

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.000
so when the child is thinking about

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.880
it they are developing frames right self

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.040
the or they're developing the frame self

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.720
othera and world they're de developing

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.959
the frame of before and after the

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:27.200
developing the frame of what came

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.959
first um

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:33.440
and so um but they

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.440
they they grow at in an ad hoc manner in

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.800
and depending upon what you know your

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.480
influences are

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.360
and um you know like you end up thinking

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.240
higher is better and lower is worse

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.240
because of North America South you know

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.920
all these things are um or that left to

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.320
right is a

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.399
progression um so yeah we try trying to

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:02.200
expose some of the

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.839
frames yeah that's coming up for me is

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:14.920
um how the title is like origin story

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.600
but like from the collective Insight

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.880
practice if that's a story then it's not

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.279
particularly

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.440
linear

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.200
um

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.760
and yeah yeah there's this other

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.959
question that's coming up I I don't know

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:30.360
if it's at all Associated maybe it's

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.680
really tangental but recently watched

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.279
your Hollows again the hollows a couple

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.720
years ago yeah and you said something

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.959
like what if we are living a past that

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:42.279
never

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:44.279
existed and I'm just like what the

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.360
does that

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.240
mean like that's sort of been on my mind

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.040
too

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.480
it's good to see

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.800
everyone Hi um I just wanted to comment

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.399
on this why question of children a young

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.959
lady I know William he's into the why

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:21.680
he's always why why why but what I

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.519
notice is he doesn't actually want me to

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.920
answer the question he just wants me to

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.600
hear him ask the why question and then

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.920
he asks another one and then another one

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.000
and then another one so I find that

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.959
quite quite interesting um and yet in

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:43.000
the classroom he's just started school

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.959
in his class he's paying a lot of

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:49.040
attention he's very real sponge in a way

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.600
at the moment but he's paying a lot of

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.680
attention for some reason to his teacher

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.079
who's teach so really they're doing

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:59.079
reading not how we used to do reading

00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:00.839
they've changed it back to the phonics

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:02.600
or the phonetics whatever you want to

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.839
call it um and he is just absorbing all

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:08.519
this and it amazes me what he can tell

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.639
me and how quickly he's reading um we've

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:13.880
not you we've used that system on on and

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.120
off in New Zealand but not much we've

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.800
tended to go for what in the old days

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.519
was whole

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:21.839
language so I'm just watching with

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:25.440
absolute curiosity to see how it all

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.440
works for him and what happens for him

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.399
his EXP experience is a limited in his

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:34.040
culture CU he's in Myanmar his parents

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.920
are from Myanmar so it's

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.839
fascinating um there's not English

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:41.639
spoken in the home much but nevertheless

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:44.600
he's reading really well so I find that

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.880
interesting um I'm not sure that

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.360
I fully feel just switching changing the

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.560
subject um I'm

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.040
not I don't know if I am getting for me

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.320
the significance of the origin story two

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.000
things I was watching some more Michael

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.279
LaVine and I'm not sure that is he even

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:11.480
bothering with an origin story I don't

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.519
know that's one question that I'm

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:15.240
sitting with the other thing I'm

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.720
wondering is it's interesting that Holly

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.600
mentioned about the

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.959
hollow if I put

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:27.079
down the linear and I put down the

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:29.320
bilard balls causality how that

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.120
interacts with

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.519
change what am I able to be with with

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:36.760
some of the

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.680
more

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.000
ancient explanations ancient origin

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.240
stories like for myself it's with um the

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.680
cabala what what am I with if I'm not

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.120
doing any of that at all what am I

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.920
picking up what am I I don't know and it

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.199
it feels very much to me and I'm only

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:01.880
just started this inquiry but it does

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.959
feel very like um when I read the Dow J

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:08.480
Zing it's just similar to the Dow it's

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.360
the

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.120
same what they're saying it's just yeah

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.000
anyway these are just inquiries and

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.079
questions and I have no answers and I'm

00:14:17.079 --> 00:14:18.480
not sure I think I'm like William I'm

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.759
not sure I even want any at the moment

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.680
I'm just curious about being the

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.680
questions so yeah thank

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.680
you

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.959
one of the things I was playing with

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:43.959
today just to give you an example

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:50.240
of this whatever is um so we have this

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.079
so one of the

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:54.279
assumptions is

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:57.560
that um if I can say something

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.000
fundamental about the Human Experience

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.519
then I'm I'm going to assume or I'm

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:05.720
going to wonder if that's fundamental

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.800
all the way down the stack okay so

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.600
Matthew said this you know like to me

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.959
what's fundamental is relationship

00:15:11.959 --> 00:15:14.240
Whitehead said the same thing

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.560
that you know particles are reaching out

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.600
feeling for each other that that that

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.199
feeling and relationship are fundamental

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:26.000
all the way down the staff right so this

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.120
is how he came up with his theory on

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.199
process in reality it's the same kind of

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.440
assumption

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.199
that what is there in front of us is

00:15:35.199 --> 00:15:39.519
like a fractal template for origin or

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:43.560
for how everything um exists and so I

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.600
was so then I was thinking like

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.240
okay we have this basic

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.240
formula um you know there's an arousal

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.319
there's arousal and then there's actions

00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:58.160
that satisfy right and it goes through

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.800
perception

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.639
but if we think of something very

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:06.560
early what does the what does the word

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.720
actions what does the phrase actions

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.120
that satisfy mean because we're we're

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.160
thinking of something very fundamental

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160
like

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.560
um and maybe it means something very

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.120
similar to what it

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.800
means uh you know I don't mean like I'm

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.519
aroused I'm coffee I I get coffee that's

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.319
an action that satisfied but what is

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:36.079
that fundamental Loop and can I apply it

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:39.120
to the

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.480
origins

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.639
story

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:46.720
um but again that's just me thinking

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.000
around it's not

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.800
like

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.160
um but that's why I played that song it

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.600
all started with a feeling it all

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.680
started with some kind of an arousal

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.480
state

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.360
since we did that practice the second

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.319
time I've been noticing that

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.760
there's or I'm

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.120
I'm trying to stay with what's the

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.360
biomarker of

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.160
arousal

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.079
that is different from the

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.600
mechanical um

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.760
blah blah blah that goes

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.960
on explaining things or anticipating

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.160
things or

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.280
strategizing

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.349
[Music]

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.000
um and there's some I I I have a little

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.039
bit of a sense that there's some kind

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.880
of way that

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.880
if I

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.120
can make space for

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.320
that that kind of arousal like it's a

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.559
very

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:08.159
different sensation of

00:18:08.159 --> 00:18:10.400
arousal that something will come that I

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.480
don't know what it is it's like knowing

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.000
there's something over there but I don't

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.280
see it

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.320
um and the it it the contrast of

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.960
the

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.520
just the

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.559
mechanical blah blah blah blah blah is

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:36.880
so marked right now it's I can feel it

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.919
as activity it's all here and then but

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:42.720
there's something else that happens here

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.400
that's different and here that's

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.039
different

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:49.880
um and I'm also noticing Sam looks very

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.360
different because he got a haircut or

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.320
something so you look like a different

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.320
Sam

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.080
it that makes me think of you know the

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.240
story I talk about these young men that

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.360
I've worked with

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.640
and they come to me because they can't

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.200
feel their feelings and then they're

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.039
surprised because they've been looking

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:19.919
for them in their

00:19:19.919 --> 00:19:23.240
heads um so this might be a part of what

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.280
you're saying you know like when the

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.760
understanding comes it might be

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.919
like it might surprise you what you're

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:34.039
actually looking for what form what form

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:36.360
it's going to come in and if you assume

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.039
is going to come if the word Insight

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:40.159
makes you think it's going to come in

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:44.840
a kind of propositional form um

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:51.440
maybe yeah maybe uh maybe that's that's

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.159
um less probable than

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:57.440
otherwise so where where are you yeah so

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.480
there's a certain bi marker of where you

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.000
are expecting the insight to show

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.679
up yeah and now I have no clue I mean I

00:20:07.679 --> 00:20:09.400
just it's so clear to me that it's not

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.799
where I thought it used to be or where I

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:17.400
would I don't know it's

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.720
just there's something

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.760
about patience and

00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:31.400
um just go for a walk outside you

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.720
know and I think there's this question

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.880
about the indigenous people I mean um do

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.840
they feel they have a sense of belonging

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.679
because of their origin stories or are

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:43.320
their origin

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.600
stories somewhat simple because they

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.480
already have a sense of belonging you

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.480
know I remember wilver saying before you

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.799
get it you struggle and struggle and

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:57.440
struggle for the right words and then

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.760
after you get it any old word word will

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.559
do you know and

00:21:02.559 --> 00:21:06.559
so so I think that's like for me with it

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:08.240
why does it matter to

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.840
tell an origin story or at least to

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.279
present the modern equivalent of an

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:18.480
origin story which is to lay it

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.240
out um

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.480
because many people

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.840
are feel displaced right because of

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.640
of and so that's what I'm saying like it

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.520
does the origin story really make

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.720
indigenous people feel like they belong

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.559
to the universe or do they feel like

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:42.000
they belong to the universe and then

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.200
they sing a story like turtles all the

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.000
way up and all the way down and I think

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.440
it's more like the second you know and

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.440
um

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.159
yeah although metaphorically it it makes

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.760
sense and I'm just partway through that

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.039
article by Charles eisenstein or that

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.600
interview with Benjamin life and Charles

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.880
eisenstein that I think speaks to this a

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.400
little bit the most recent um substack

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.360
post by

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.400
him and that question question

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.240
of do

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.080
we do we need a story to get out of the

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.039
sort of out of the

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:41.200
story that we're

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.200
in

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.720
um and how do

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.159
we invite that

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:54.279
or not overly ritualize

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.960
that

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.360
so maybe we can go back

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.120
to this question of internal and

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.399
external

00:24:43.399 --> 00:24:46.399
relations

00:24:48.919 --> 00:24:53.320
um and the compound individuals so it's

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.320
like

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.279
um

00:24:58.279 --> 00:25:00.799
when we are in

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:03.159
conversation then some something of the

00:25:03.159 --> 00:25:05.600
other person's subjectivity the word is

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.880
ingresses into me I become internally

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.799
related to them um so I could have be

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:14.640
having an argue with them and and

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.279
punching them and yet it's shaping my

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.399
internal subjectivity so when I get up

00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:20.799
and walk

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:24.559
away there's part of that event that

00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:28.039
interaction has modified me that that's

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:32.679
what internal relationship is and with

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:37.360
certain um with certain experiences like

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.159
you know the first time you have like

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:42.520
amazing sex and you lose the sense of

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.679
whose body is doing who that's kind of

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:49.000
like the Gap Junctions opening up you

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.120
you become a single identity and that

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.559
would be uh in all internal

00:25:55.559 --> 00:25:58.600
relationships um

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.000
and so in general we have both internal

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.960
and external relationships with each

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.799
other they can be

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:12.880
asymmetric um you could I could

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.240
be really preoccupied with you really my

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.399
interior life really shaped by you and

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:21.640
you can't the other person can't escape

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.600
some shaping

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.159
but maybe they're your boss and they

00:26:26.159 --> 00:26:28.480
just care that you walk you know that

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.520
you're at your desk on time or something

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.880
like that would be an external

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.840
relationship

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.200
so if you think you could imagine this

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.279
is all imagination work right you can

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:47.399
imagine the very origin is just

00:26:47.399 --> 00:26:49.840
completely into it can't relate to

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.120
anything

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.919
else because it's it's the only thing

00:26:53.919 --> 00:26:56.039
that exists and it's pure potential

00:26:56.039 --> 00:26:58.919
right or whatever it's it's it's pure

00:26:58.919 --> 00:27:01.520
internal

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.200
relations um does that make sense it

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.440
can't can't be externally related to

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.559
anything else and somehow this gives

00:27:09.559 --> 00:27:12.159
rise

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.039
to the condition of external

00:27:16.039 --> 00:27:18.360
relationships you can't start with

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.200
external it it doesn't work because then

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.039
you have two things that you have to say

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:27.640
how they exist so if you imagine

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.440
something that's completely internally

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.120
related to itself we could call that God

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.120
um

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:51.120
um and then you can I feel this kind

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.519
of possibility for people to

00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.840
keep

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.080
allowing the world to constantly enter

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.279
you it's kind of

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:06.360
like the the the universe is trying to

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.200
crawl back

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.919
to being internally related to

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:14.279
everything

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.880
else so that's one thing and then here's

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.679
the question it's always like this

00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:32.000
stupid mental model we have once we get

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
to

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.679
like are

00:28:38.679 --> 00:28:42.000
are are atoms I mean I think there's

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.600
internal relations in

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.880
atoms okay so one of the ways you can

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.760
think about internal and external

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.720
relationships are

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.880
also this word decomposability

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:57.880
so if we sit here we're a collective we

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.519
have we know there's some internal

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:01.960
relationships being built and there's

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.720
external signifiers being exchanged it's

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.679
not all of it makes it you know it's not

00:29:08.679 --> 00:29:10.799
all clear when we talk to each other not

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:13.799
all of it gets immediately

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:17.799
absorbed um but this group is quite

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:20.159
decomposable when we

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:22.559
leave all the individuals don't

00:29:22.559 --> 00:29:25.720
deteriorate right we can get up and go

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.760
away so this is one definition of why

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.679
it's not a compound

00:29:32.679 --> 00:29:37.159
individual whereas if on myself in my

00:29:37.159 --> 00:29:40.559
body got up and left there would be

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:42.720
nothing left to me I'm minimally

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.320
decomposable what is a person

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.679
decomposable to well once you're mature

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:51.039
you can take out organs and put machines

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:55.080
in there or other organs

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.240
um there's some um and this is this is

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.080
where Levan's work is you know he he's

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.880
going to show us

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.919
that living things are more decomposable

00:30:06.919 --> 00:30:08.000
than you think because you can

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.720
bioengineer them and this is weird stuff

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.120
but um people in general are are

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.519
minimally

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:19.240
decomposable whereas um JJ always uses

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.440
the example of a magnet every time you

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.240
know has a it has two poles we cut it in

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.279
half each half has two poles so this is

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:31.000
maximally

00:30:31.039 --> 00:30:35.840
decomposable so these are ideas

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.600
that are just other frames that come in

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.000
when I and other people have done this

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.640
before like these are

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.760
the Simone Den's working with his own

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.200
like these are

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.240
the yeah these are some of

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.880
the pegs to hang your hat

00:31:24.399 --> 00:31:29.039
on let's um make this zoom out now and

00:31:29.039 --> 00:31:31.720
ask this question

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.679
should should a spirituality have an

00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:38.919
origin story and if or why does it

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:40.480
matter

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.399
um um and this is interesting to me

00:31:45.399 --> 00:31:50.200
because you know in my community RIT

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.000
large there's a lot of people trying to

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.760
you know Charles eisenstein tell a new

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.799
story or um cosmotic humanism is a whole

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:02.559
metaphysics

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:08.039
of reality and the nature of you know

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:09.799
reality

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:12.919
um and there's this resurgent in the

00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:14.120
religious

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.600
impulse and um yeah my question

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.679
is there's a spirituality need a origin

00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:24.440
story

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.080
or

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.440
um

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.120
or does it matter is it

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.120
helpful

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.799
yeah one sort of question that I was

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:44.240
thinking of just a few minutes ago when

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.720
you were talking about all these

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.559
different pegs we could hang our hat on

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.639
for

00:32:49.639 --> 00:32:53.799
this um

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:59.039
was um

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:02.480
how much of this is metaphor and how

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.960
much of this is

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.480
real and in terms of what we're talking

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.559
about here and I don't know why I was

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:12.639
kind of smiling because it all

00:33:12.639 --> 00:33:15.320
seemed silly I don't know maybe not

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.120
silly

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.120
but the one thought that occurred to me

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:25.000
was maybe we don't need like a story

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.600
that says this is how it is but more

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.320
something along the lines of

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.440
poetry like when I think of like roomies

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.240
like or reading like Walden or something

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.519
it it it it it does something and I

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:46.080
don't necessarily take it as maybe I'm

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.559
less inclined to take it as oh this is

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:53.880
how things are and get all you

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.159
know chunky with it it

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:00.639
like sits it has a feeling that sits and

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:02.120
it I don't know it does something

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.200
different it seems I don't

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.200
know

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.480
feeling I think we're trying to what

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.720
we're trying to express as an origin

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.320
story is imaginal or speculative

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.480
philosophy but I think it what matters

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.200
is real and so for example and

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.879
contemporary

00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:27.919
so

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:31.800
and in some there's some

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.000
indication that

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.839
um you see if if we're members of this a

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:43.720
society the way my CS are part of me

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.200
then I have

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.399
no i h i don't I I lack a certain kind

00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:50.359
of

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:54.520
agency so is is is the collective is is

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:58.200
society a compound individual

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.000
um or is it something

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.920
else um so that's

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.680
that's one thing why it matters

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.359
um yeah and it's a cyborg a compound

00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:23.760
individual or is it a collection of

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.880
parts I don't know these are questions

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:32.760
um is a body a big ritual is it just a

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:35.760
habit these are questions that I think

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.800
are populate

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.280
our contemporary imagination and have

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.920
real

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.440
world

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.440
uh consequences

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.000
Anna hi everyone thanks Matt for that

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.520
last thing because something arose for

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.640
me around the origins and the word

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:03.560
signal and Remembrance because I had a

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.560
walk this morning

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.280
and the dog was just beside me and and

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.319
it's spring with it's the second day

00:36:11.319 --> 00:36:13.440
just had full moon and then all of a

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.160
sudden this huge wind blowing in from

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.480
the Cliffs of the ocean and I was like

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.520
literally blown away and then there is a

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.680
blue feather right right in front of me

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.040
and I'm I'm thinking what the am I

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.680
going to start making meaning here of

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.400
things or am I just going to stay in

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.319
this

00:36:32.319 --> 00:36:34.960
experience and the moment I allowed

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.880
myself to stay there it went from from

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.040
to the heart and all of a sudden I felt

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.800
this Radiance of love like pouring out

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.520
and it poured in it's like I allowed it

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.200
in I let the world

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.640
in and that

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.319
was and then all of a sudden I felt my

00:36:54.319 --> 00:36:56.839
grandfather beside me and I I all his

00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:58.920
work that he's been writing and about

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.960
telepathy and about all of that stuff

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.960
like boom hit me and I was what the

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.160
is this H what's happening here and it

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.880
made me feel alive and I let it all go

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.680
and I thought Yep this is my pilgrimage

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.000
and I don't have one place I don't have

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.640
to go to Santiago de compostella or

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.200
wherever I am and that's the signal that

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.960
I'm feeling and this I amness is growing

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.400
but this I amness is also so a

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.240
remembrance and almost like a

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.280
responsibility I feel when I am with

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.880
others and it's almost like the seeing

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.960
when there is an I am and an I am and

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.359
they meet the

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:48.040
it and the it is it that's it it's like

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.960
I am it and you are it and we are it and

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.119
he is it and she is it and that's that

00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:54.359
it's very simple but it is not at the

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:57.560
same time and

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.119
because my mind is in the way because

00:37:59.119 --> 00:38:01.760
I'm making meaning of stuff because

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.760
that's how what I've been taught in in

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.920
school to make meaning of stuff what

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.880
does the color blue mean or what does

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.400
the tree mean no can I feel the tree can

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.599
I feel the signal of the aliveness the

00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:16.920
Vitality of what's around me and in me

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.760
and can I relate with that and there's

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.319
this I'll get goosebumps when I just I

00:38:22.319 --> 00:38:24.720
don't know I'll probably leave it here

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.520
because this is it

00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:40.480
that was great thanks Anna um yeah to

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.960
that question of you know do we need an

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.640
origin story and I've

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.839
been thinking you know being in this new

00:38:46.839 --> 00:38:49.760
I'm in a new landscape here in in uh New

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.280
England

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.079
and um I don't I don't need to know it's

00:38:54.079 --> 00:38:55.760
origin story it's kind of what I'm

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.960
realizing it's it's so much more about

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.720
tending to so I don't know the origin

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.680
story of the lake or the

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.119
trees um but what's more important is

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:07.280
for me at least is this sort of aspect

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.920
of cording and cording for me is tending

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.240
to it's paying attention what makes what

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.240
makes this what's the essence of this

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.800
place what makes it um original you know

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.280
so maybe it's not so much an origin

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.119
story but it's tending to what makes

00:39:22.119 --> 00:39:24.760
something kind of original what makes it

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.000
unique and differentiated

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.480
um and and that's from there then that

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.880
leads that moves me or or leads to

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.520
different actions and behaviors is just

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:37.319
tending to the area and what it's

00:39:37.319 --> 00:39:40.280
calling paying attention to it and then

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.800
it shows me how to respond to it kind of

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.000
um just like when you're courting

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.319
somebody you know you kind of look at

00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:47.000
their particulars and what makes them

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
unique and interesting and then you you

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.480
serve that you honor that you um you

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.680
give yourself to them in that way so um

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.280
yeah maybe we don't need an origin story

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.960
but maybe more tending to what makes

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.079
something original and in that way of

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:04.560
falling in love with with the world

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.440
around

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.839
us I love that now origin original I

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:15.560
love that that's very rich

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.240
Sam yeah that was that was great um I

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.400
think about run rasmason we encountered

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.599
R rasm Mason's work he's like the Nordic

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.480
animism guy

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.079
I encountered him through bioa and he

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:33.760
has this uh I don't remember what it's

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.839
called but he has this video on Nordic

00:40:37.839 --> 00:40:40.359
animist mythology and essentially one

00:40:40.359 --> 00:40:43.440
one of the things he's saying is

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.960
that we can think like the post axial

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.760
age like he calls it a discontinuous

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.599
cosmology you know you have like the

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:53.520
sense of a realm that's Transcendent to

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.240
where we are right now and that actually

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.720
that's actually the basis for having an

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.200
origin story that just stays the same

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.440
and is consistent and like Remains the

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.880
Same story that we always refer back to

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.240
and he's he's almost saying that like

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.040
for like like genuine animism and he's

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.800
talking about syntic animism it's really

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.480
syncretic it's always kind of

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.720
improvising and it's its function is not

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.000
so much to give an account that is

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.440
static uh but more to um like facilitate

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.000
the ongoing Act of creating linkages and

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.839
and ritual relating he says it so it's

00:41:26.839 --> 00:41:28.839
like it's actually like it's the it's

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:31.880
like a senu or it's like fascia almost

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.480
that sort of bind together the ways that

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.880
we relating to intending

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.880
relationships um which is kind of

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.359
interesting so this question like I mean

00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:42.000
do we need an origin story but I guess

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.880
do we need something like story do we

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.240
need something um

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.359
that that creates some kind of

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:53.760
um I mean this this idea of whether we

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.599
need meaning or not you know can we just

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.160
dispense with that all together and just

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.440
kind of operate from something much more

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.720
uh immediate like a feeling and kind of

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.040
let let that be primordial right and

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.800
it's interesting in in the kind of

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.920
communal revery practice further on

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.040
we've only done this on Zoom but it's

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.160
like eventually like we you know it' be

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.960
like groups rather than doing kind of

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.800
collective Insight we just sense in and

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.240
then just let images come and sometimes

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.559
they'd have like these really like

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:25.359
incredibly beautiful Legend like or

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:27.480
myth-like stor would just come out of

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.480
nowhere and the relationships between

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.880
these figures would have this really

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.000
these beautiful qualities and it it had

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.079
this feeling of being deeply mysterious

00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:39.920
and symbolic but they they just come out

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.240
of nowhere and then we kind of put them

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.119
down and we don't like hang on to them

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:44.920
and take them with us and like make them

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.920
into this story but there is this um

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.720
capacity for I guess why have there been

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.160
origin stories at all you know what

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.119
function in in like Nordic animist

00:42:57.119 --> 00:43:00.000
cosmology would even a syncretic kind of

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.240
ongoing improvising kind of story that

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.440
can how does that how does that

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.200
facilitate relating I guess that's what

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.240
I'm wondering you know is story

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.800
unnecessary or does it can it be

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.880
something that doesn't need to be static

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.720
like an

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.359
unchanging uh story or myth mytho but

00:43:19.359 --> 00:43:21.839
something that

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.359
can just change change and develop as

00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:27.079
things are are changing and developing

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:29.079
all the time anyway you know I I don't

00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:30.240
know I don't know what the role of all

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.079
that stuff is but it's coming

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:45.319
UPA hi I think uh I just want to say I

00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:48.559
think I think we need a story oh I I

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:50.640
think I need a story that's it I think

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.839
so but I don't have uh reason to tell

00:43:54.839 --> 00:43:58.559
you yeah we don't we we don't have to

00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:01.359
justify here um because these are just

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:04.720
these are feeling truth s you know we

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.440
just we just we just feel that that's

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.079
the case these these can't be resolved

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:14.559
these question isn't resolvable it's

00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:17.559
whether

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.680
yeah you know it's funny

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.359
because

00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:28.359
um depending upon your

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:32.640
upbringing you get

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.640
told um you know there's a lot of myths

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.400
that you're told like Santa Claus and

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.599
the Tooth

00:44:40.599 --> 00:44:44.240
Fairy and the origins maybe the origin

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.240
story um maybe that's what you're saying

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.480
Sam so then the the thing about growing

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.240
up Catholic when I grew up was like the

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.359
origin stories that you're told when

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:56.640
you're a kid

00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:01.400
is like a Santa Claus story and then um

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.200
but then it it doesn't really like

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.800
you're surrounded by adults that just

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.200
believe the very simple literal story

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.520
you know that it hasn't it

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.760
hasn't lived

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.920
in hasn't morphed or lived through

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.839
people's experience it's just a

00:45:20.839 --> 00:45:23.640
placeholder or

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.880
something

00:45:34.119 --> 00:45:36.359
yeah I'm thinking about the origin

00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:40.920
stories and so yeah many people you

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.520
know well or at least

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.480
personally when you're young and then

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.319
you all of a sudden you realize everyone

00:45:47.319 --> 00:45:50.400
else is kind of buying the simple story

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.119
and you know you kind of get that period

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:54.880
of disillusionment and I'm

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.440
wondering earlier someone here I think

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.240
it was iani said something

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.359
about the the causality of the

00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:05.680
indigenous right do they do they sing

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.319
these myths because they feel belonging

00:46:07.319 --> 00:46:09.520
or do they feel belonging because they

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.559
or you know what happened

00:46:11.559 --> 00:46:14.240
first and I'm wondering you know like if

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.960
if we all came from indigenous peoples

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.440
at one point

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.800
supposedly right it's like okay then why

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.800
did we stop well how come some cultures

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:24.599
became

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:26.800
different um

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:28.119
and I wondering if it has to do with

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.599
something with like that

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:34.280
same disconnection from belonging that

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.319
we just kind of that you talked about

00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.359
right there where you realize all the

00:46:37.359 --> 00:46:39.920
adults are buying the simple

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.680
story like you know imagine

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.559
you're 100 thousand years ago whatever I

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:49.119
I don't know the timeline but you're in

00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:50.880
this indigenous community and then you

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.440
kind of have this like wait this is

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.640
like or like or may do or maybe you

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.480
you're for some reason you feel a

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.400
connection a disconnection you feel like

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.960
a separation so you don't feel that

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.760
belonging with the tribe and

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.400
then

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.200
you feel compelled

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:16.079
to seek truth elsewhere so I'm wondering

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:18.839
if there's something

00:47:18.839 --> 00:47:21.480
about you know maybe it's your someone

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.839
was bored or maybe they just had a an in

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:28.920
think that the world was more beautiful

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.200
than the their Community they are part

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.119
of portrayed it

00:47:34.119 --> 00:47:37.160
as and I'm wondering if that sort of

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.000
impulse is what

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.960
drives

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:44.880
um cultures to change and new cultures

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.920
to come about in some

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.839
way well you know it's interesting

00:47:51.839 --> 00:47:55.240
because I mean it can't speak for all

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.839
indigenous people so just kind of

00:47:57.839 --> 00:48:01.760
categorize here um but well let's just

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.520
look at Genesis the Old Testament I mean

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.359
Genesis is not really interested in why

00:48:07.359 --> 00:48:09.200
did the how the stars and the Sun and

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:11.520
the Moon and the planets came into

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.760
existence they're really interested in

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.880
telling the story of the Hebrew people

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.119
right so they go like this happened this

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:21.160
happened then it starts and it gets very

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.640
juicy and all this stuff and and I think

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.200
that

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.040
um I think a lot of TR indigenous origin

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.160
stories are more like that like

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.079
they they feel deeply belonging to the

00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:39.440
earth and the animals and stuff but what

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.760
all that stuff up

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.559
there is allowed to be somewhat

00:48:45.559 --> 00:48:48.119
mysterious and then you get the then you

00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:50.839
get you know mo modernity and we're like

00:48:50.839 --> 00:48:54.119
oh we we can trace this back to the

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:57.359
beginning of time right so this OB this

00:48:57.359 --> 00:49:00.480
Frame itself is an obsession that

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.480
emerges only in a certain a certain

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.839
uh so this the story that

00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:12.240
just um situates you in your tribe and

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.240
maybe down to your totem that had some

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.720
animals in in your

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.960
landscape that ceases to be satisfying

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.319
anymore and we start asking questions at

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:26.680
this

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:32.319
Monumental scale and time frame

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.119
um which is

00:49:48.559 --> 00:49:51.640
interesting the question I have is

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.520
what what

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.760
purpose does an origin story serve or

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.359
you know when you raised the question

00:50:00.359 --> 00:50:03.799
Bonnie about should should

00:50:03.799 --> 00:50:07.599
spirituality have an origin story or

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:10.839
should and

00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:15.760
I it it seems

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.160
like there's

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.240
a there's a way that

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:30.040
it's it's generative of some kind of

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:33.559
belonging

00:50:34.799 --> 00:50:37.319
and does that

00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:41.640
then move into exclusion of those who

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:46.200
don't belong or you know I I start to

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.000
wonder

00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:55.079
about why we want to explain things in

00:50:55.079 --> 00:50:56.839
that way

00:50:56.839 --> 00:50:59.480
way and then

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.400
further

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.559
having

00:51:03.559 --> 00:51:07.520
um Revisited the trust

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.119
material wondering do we just

00:51:11.119 --> 00:51:14.119
need

00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:20.799
a a deeper sense

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:26.640
of how do we trust how do we

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.440
operate inside of our trust

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.880
networks and the last question that has

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.960
been percolating is I I don't I'm really

00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:45.200
fuzzy on my biology but is

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.079
this what about the first amoeba like is

00:51:49.079 --> 00:51:53.359
it just is our origin story something

00:51:53.359 --> 00:51:54.359
like

00:51:54.359 --> 00:51:57.040
that

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.200
this is the

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.359
overarching metaphor that

00:52:02.359 --> 00:52:06.240
I keep coming back to that I think the

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:10.280
or an origin story that

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.200
is um inspiring and TR and truthful

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.760
enough you know it's not like okay there

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.319
was a first turtle and then they had b a

00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.760
turtle you know truthful enough still

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:26.440
imaginary and speculative is that that

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.400
go you know God or origin is like the

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.720
first

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.480
amiea

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.240
and so when Anna describes what she was

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.160
saying and she didn't think about what

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.559
was going on she didn't turned the

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:45.359
experience into being externally related

00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:47.960
to the Ling lingu it was and then she

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.520
just look at she said I am like what is

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.920
that very Christopher Alexander he sees

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.839
his

00:52:53.839 --> 00:52:57.480
self that he sees in this this

00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.119
extraordinary experience the same Living

00:53:00.119 --> 00:53:04.280
Center that's in him and this is

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.799
like the amoeba realizing that you know

00:53:08.799 --> 00:53:10.280
the amoeba maybe I just read a

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.880
children's story for that chapter the

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.160
amoeba is sad because it can't find its

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.599
parent and then it realizes

00:53:18.599 --> 00:53:21.359
that you know the first in the same way

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:23.440
that the first amoeba is there and not

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.839
there at the same time

00:53:25.839 --> 00:53:28.359
this compound individual that's only

00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:30.680
internally

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.799
related establishes the internal

00:53:33.799 --> 00:53:36.520
relationships of everything

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.799
else um so we're and then this

00:53:39.799 --> 00:53:42.920
extraordinary thing happens where um

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.359
like the mutation then in this origin

00:53:46.359 --> 00:53:49.079
Stories

00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:53.280
the the ability to have external

00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.599
relations the ability to to be

00:53:56.599 --> 00:54:00.760
externally related to each other um and

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.720
not just one a

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.000
glutenous amoeba right which means that

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
amoeba have to eat each other and all

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.680
this other stuff there's a lot of

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:15.160
consequences from it but

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.760
um yeah I just keep coming back to that

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.000
is the first am but still around and I

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.799
think this is what people say when they

00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:28.799
say you know speak from Source it's that

00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:32.440
part of you that's the

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.640
originary internal

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.640
relationship it's the part of you that's

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:41.640
still the amoeba still the first amoeba

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.319
but it's not like it gets distributed

00:54:43.319 --> 00:54:45.319
and watered down right

00:54:45.319 --> 00:54:49.280
because every amoeba is not just it's

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.799
not like the amoeba cuts into two and

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:54.760
cuts into two so now the existing amibas

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.880
at tiny tiny little things after being

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.880
cut into two it's not you know what I'm

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:01.720
saying it's

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.920
it's it's not reduction

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:08.440
over over time over

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.359
propagation uh which that's another

00:55:10.359 --> 00:55:14.040
interesting thing to to think

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.319
about

00:55:17.319 --> 00:55:20.520
that uh because it could have been

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.720
otherwise right it could have been

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.039
something that

00:55:23.039 --> 00:55:27.000
just continually

00:55:27.079 --> 00:55:29.480
divides and reduces itself but that's

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.920
also part of the metaphor is that that

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:37.000
doesn't happen it's not reduced as it

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
divides

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:44.599
um and of course the first if you want

00:55:44.599 --> 00:55:46.839
to give a DA spare to it the first

00:55:46.839 --> 00:55:49.599
division is yin and yang but the yin is

00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:51.440
internally related to the Yang and the

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.359
Yang is internally related to the yin

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:55.200
that's why the white one has a little

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.200
dark circle and the dark one has a

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.839
little light circle because the internal

00:56:00.839 --> 00:56:04.760
relations reconstitute the

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:09.480
whole say it's a way to say the same

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.160
thing it's not like the yin is part Yang

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.400
Yang is the in internal scepter of the

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.319
yin and Yin is the

00:56:18.319 --> 00:56:21.240
internal scepter and then yin and yang

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:25.440
are are externally related to each other

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.960
in their

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.380
[Music]

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.559
interactions I just had a fun moment

00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:44.680
where I wanted to look up the emology of

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.200
the word origin and usually when I do

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.920
that I just type like emology and then

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.960
the word so I typed emology origin and

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.520
then it gave me like the origin of

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.960
atmology instead of like

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.559
the etymology of

00:56:58.559 --> 00:57:01.920
origin well atmology means origin right

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.000
yeah in a way in a way

00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:26.799
yeah

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:49.559
I don't think I understand a lot of what

00:57:49.559 --> 00:57:52.079
we're talking

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.680
about well well do do you understand

00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:00.839
that phrase is the first amiea still

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.839
around I

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.760
can I mean you understand yeah like yeah

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.280
theia to works on down the line to you

00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.599
and everything

00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:23.720
else

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.720
right

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.000
is that the right I don't know I don't

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
know is that the right I don't know way

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.599
to think about it I don't know like I

00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:37.839
don't

00:58:38.079 --> 00:58:40.480
know sorry I have a lot of fire trucks

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.640
here

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:46.319
right is it the same question as uh if

00:58:46.319 --> 00:58:48.240
we ask ourselves are we drinking Dino

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:51.119
pee in the

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.720
water

00:58:59.839 --> 00:59:02.880
well is the first dinosaur still around

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.039
are the dinosaurs still

00:59:05.039 --> 00:59:07.359
here right well

00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:11.880
that's supposedly they evolved into

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:23.240
Birds they also became gasoline or

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.640
oil yes

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.720
interesting it comes I don't know for Me

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.280
Maybe it comes back to like because

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.680
we're still when we say it's this first

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:43.119
to me around that kind of

00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:45.799
thing to me it brings me back to the

00:59:45.799 --> 00:59:49.400
question of do we need a story because

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.280
because even that seems like a story to

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.640
me you

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.920
know that's kind of where I

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:02.960
go well I would argue that you operate

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.039
within different stories all the time

01:00:07.039 --> 01:00:11.200
like for the most part we tend to assume

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.760
that there was a big bang and then

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.200
something happened that we don't

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.920
understand because we're not physicists

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.799
and then these things happen in gravity

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:21.319
and P and blah blah blah and

01:00:21.319 --> 01:00:26.760
then otions and soup and then proteins

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.480
and then lipids and then cellular life I

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.359
mean it's it's a story filled with holes

01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:34.400
but in

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.960
general many of us even if we sit here

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.319
and examine it and say no I don't really

01:00:41.319 --> 01:00:46.000
believe that this is how we tend to our

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.640
basis of

01:00:49.119 --> 01:00:52.319
operation so that may be a good thing it

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:56.960
may be a bad thing maybe a new neutral

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.680
thing yeah I mean I think stories have

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.359
definitely the power to move

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:06.520
us the story I grew up with original sin

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.160
you know that was a big big story for me

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.160
growing up and the story we're telling

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.079
now was really different from that story

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:15.599
but how that story moved me and you know

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:17.039
affected my behavior in a lot of

01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:18.280
different ways

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.640
so it's important yeah that's a big one

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.079
for me

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:26.160
too people gr up and they they even if

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.400
you sit there it catches you you know

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.799
like as a grown woman I remember I would

01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:32.680
never say I believed it but then I was

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.880
in

01:01:35.119 --> 01:01:37.760
this difficult situation and I couldn't

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.720
fig and and underneath that was

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.920
like that I

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.799
owed that you owe a debt just by your

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:49.640
very existence you know a Graber talks

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.520
about

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.440
this

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.440
um

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.520
that the cause a loop in the Catholic

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.359
story is that you're a

01:02:10.119 --> 01:02:16.039
sinner because of your lineage as a

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.200
human

01:02:23.039 --> 01:02:26.599
yeah do think it's

01:02:26.599 --> 01:02:30.039
possible to operate without stories and

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.079
what would that be

01:02:32.079 --> 01:02:35.440
like like what's that

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.480
um it's not possible to be a human and

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.880
to operate without at least

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.960
frames you know so like you might not

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.400
think

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:50.039
um like you think most people think that

01:02:50.039 --> 01:02:52.640
the past goes time goes from the past to

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.839
the Future so you could call that a

01:02:54.839 --> 01:02:57.000
story a very very very foundational

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.520
story or you could call it a frame so

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.000
maybe you could get rid of all stories

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.240
you can certainly get rid of

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.680
autobiographical narratives about

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.079
yourself

01:03:09.079 --> 01:03:12.760
um it's pretty easy

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.480
to avoid most of the conditioning of

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.240
cultural

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.680
narratives

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.599
um but if you if you allow the word

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:26.680
story to get deeper and deeper into

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:30.799
these frames it's very difficult

01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:34.279
to to

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:41.079
uh for a human being not to operate with

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:46.520
frames it's part of our intelligence

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:49.799
right and part

01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:53.279
of our problem at the same time

01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:54.880
Kevin

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.440
yeah what's interesting about say like

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.520
the big bang is a

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.640
story right is

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.960
like you know we say the word story and

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.359
it kind of already or narrative and it

01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:08.200
kind of has this assumption that it's

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.559
words and it's like a word narrative

01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:14.359
like we can tell orally but then if you

01:04:14.359 --> 01:04:15.400
look at you know think about the Big

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.480
Bang it's like I'm sure you know there

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.400
are scientists who ex understand it in

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.319
such detail that's not just like words

01:04:24.319 --> 01:04:26.640
it's like mathematical and like the

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.279
physics of it and they understand how we

01:04:28.279 --> 01:04:29.799
know that by

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:33.000
like um you know like using our

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.240
telescopes or whatever to view how far

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.920
away the stars are and the composition

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.440
of gases and all that kind of stuff so

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:40.920
it's

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.160
like but then eventually it kind of you

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.799
know gets compressed or simplified

01:04:49.799 --> 01:04:51.799
into

01:04:51.799 --> 01:04:54.319
a narrative story or you know maybe

01:04:54.319 --> 01:04:55.720
you're in science class or something or

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.160
you're watching Bill eye and there's

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.839
like an illustration and animation or

01:04:59.839 --> 01:05:01.039
whatever

01:05:01.039 --> 01:05:05.039
but I think yeah

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:08.079
calling talking about origin and stories

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:09.440
you know you kind of have to yeah kind

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.599
of have to consider the the medium of

01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:15.520
How It's communicated but also like

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.799
what's not being said what's compressed

01:05:17.799 --> 01:05:21.440
by like the the like what complexities

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:26.000
the story is the story is covering up

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.160
yeah I mean when you get

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.680
to so most physicists know a lot about a

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.680
certain

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:37.119
local like they can look at the universe

01:05:37.119 --> 01:05:40.799
and say this is locally what happens and

01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:43.920
then they infer from that um that it's

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.079
consistent with their story but most

01:05:46.079 --> 01:05:47.920
physicists know there's a problem at the

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:51.079
big bang you know they don't know if the

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:53.359
Universe goes out and then comes back

01:05:53.359 --> 01:05:55.920
and contract they don't know if there's

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.520
multiverses they just have to it's an

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.440
epistemic constraint you have to start

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.279
with something that is okay let's what's

01:06:02.279 --> 01:06:05.520
called it started but even then Lee

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.359
Mullen says our whole conception of

01:06:08.359 --> 01:06:12.760
saying something started at some time is

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.079
has to do with maybe there was no time

01:06:15.079 --> 01:06:18.039
if there was no time before six seconds

01:06:18.039 --> 01:06:20.680
or the plank scale after the big bang

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.039
then it's hard to use that language to

01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:27.760
say anything about it so physicists talk

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.039
like crazy people like us when they're

01:06:30.039 --> 01:06:33.160
doing pH uh theoretical physics at that

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.240
boundary um and what they usually do

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.839
like Sabina hoffen Felder she's like

01:06:38.839 --> 01:06:40.720
well we can be really really sh when we

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.319
take this Frame and we look at this

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:48.200
phenomenon and uh we like it when that

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:52.680
can fit into this narrative Arc um but

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.880
you can't actually obs

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.359
observe the whole universe doing its

01:06:57.359 --> 01:06:59.599
thing right so you have to have these

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:02.359
inferences and the inferences like this

01:07:02.359 --> 01:07:04.799
is why physics is so hard

01:07:04.799 --> 01:07:08.799
they all them it's kind of like what Sam

01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:10.400
was saying

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.880
like it's exactly like that like the

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.680
origin stories it has to keep

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.520
accommodating more and more and more and

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.119
more and more and more you know like

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:22.640
Galactic lensing and all this stuff and

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.920
so uh

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:30.880
they're kind of probably in the same

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.680
boat that we are at a certain point at a

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.240
certain point they there's there's no

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.039
knowledge the knowledge building thing

01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:48.599
stops so Bonnie if

01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:51.680
we did Collective

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.599
Insight um

01:07:55.599 --> 01:08:00.559
and somehow would you imagine that a

01:08:00.559 --> 01:08:04.200
sense of an origin story would

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.400
emerge if we kept at it yeah but you

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.200
have to be you have to

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:15.679
be swallowed by the impulse this is this

01:08:15.679 --> 01:08:20.719
is you know it had like

01:08:20.719 --> 01:08:22.839
like

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.839
um

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.400
you have need enough interest to

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.960
sustain stain sustain that and then it

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.600
takes you into reading all kinds of

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.239
other stuff and blah blah blah blah blah

01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:36.920
blah so that's what it would be nice is

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.759
to

01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:41.759
find if we do a live session to find

01:08:41.759 --> 01:08:44.080
something that people really want

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.159
to

01:08:46.159 --> 01:08:50.120
um like I I wrote a few everybody in the

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.400
group has to

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.159
be really want

01:08:55.159 --> 01:08:57.799
to so you know I have to write this book

01:08:57.799 --> 01:09:01.040
so I really want some nice new ideas on

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:07.400
Origins so um but the this is I

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.640
proposed for

01:09:10.759 --> 01:09:13.239
example you could do Collective Insight

01:09:13.239 --> 01:09:16.000
in catalyze a shift in view about humans

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.640
how humans live in the world and how we

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.440
can conduct our lives in order to so you

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.600
can do number one stop destruction at

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.640
massive scale inter up downstreet

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:27.679
exponential risk so that sounds very

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.040
complicated but it

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.679
means can I as a human I can't go and

01:09:32.679 --> 01:09:36.199
and eliminate existential risk but how

01:09:36.199 --> 01:09:37.600
can I as a

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.799
person interrupt existential risk

01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:44.040
Downstream from me so this is a doable

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.799
thing so what you would do is you you

01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:49.120
could have still big question because

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.799
then you go out and you come back in and

01:09:50.799 --> 01:09:54.920
you go out and you come back in but then

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.239
um yeah you'd have to be so do you see

01:09:58.239 --> 01:10:01.239
what I mean like this is how you could

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:04.600
compress a very broad philosophical

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.760
question

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.760
into a community of practice for example

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.520
so

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:19.880
um so if we collectively incited in An

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.560
Origin

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:25.640
story what would we do with it

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.679
well we we would have reasons why

01:10:30.679 --> 01:10:34.560
we think there's a need for a new origin

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:39.239
story incited or incited both both yeah

01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:42.000
I was thinking about it with the yeah

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.560
yeah

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.080
um we

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:51.120
would the the the Assumption and at some

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.640
point you just do things because it's

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.440
axiomatic is is that there's a problem

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:58.679
that we don't have origin stories and

01:10:58.679 --> 01:11:00.600
even if people don't believe that God

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.320
made the world in six days they act as

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.840
if the physicist story is

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.000
right and that

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.400
has consequences on um a lot of things

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.280
let's just say that okay so um now it

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.480
may not be that may not be your

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:25.360
assumption um and uh

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.719
for example Alexander Bard in processing

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:34.080
event um is arguing that in Christian

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.679
eschatology is all event what's the

01:11:36.679 --> 01:11:39.880
origin the event of the Resurrection the

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.639
event of the Virgin Mary the event and

01:11:43.639 --> 01:11:49.719
he's saying that um adventism is

01:11:49.719 --> 01:11:52.800
over in this case you wouldn't even want

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.960
to Pro origin story because it's very

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.159
much

01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:58.600
adventism from that

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.520
perspective um but if you feel

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.520
like

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.280
um if you're gripped with

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.239
something that's very intriguing to you

01:12:13.239 --> 01:12:16.679
and it feels like an origin story is in

01:12:16.679 --> 01:12:18.719
there somewhere that could be

01:12:18.719 --> 01:12:22.480
helpful um I don't know you know I

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.480
don't

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.679
or like I said it could it could even be

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:32.400
you're not telling an origin story

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:36.920
you're situating the role of origin in

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.080
The Human Condition today and as a

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.960
reflection or something like that

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.040
um but my experience Collective Insight

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.960
practice is it can be some something

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:55.440
like Anna just said it can be

01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:59.440
um very powerful where like you might

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.239
not have an origin story at the end of

01:13:01.239 --> 01:13:02.360
the end of

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.920
it but you might have

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.800
like an obsession like it's the first am

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.719
but still around and why does why is

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:13.800
that so interesting and then then you

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.760
know we had our workshop last weekend

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.280
and Layman Pascal and Tom Murray were

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.239
here the ones who got me sick those

01:13:25.239 --> 01:13:29.239
bastards the the virus ingressed into my

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:33.000
body and um we were talking about this

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.800
and then I I was running out for my

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:39.000
Parallax course and I was running

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.239
out there was a chance that I wouldn't

01:13:41.239 --> 01:13:42.960
see them again because they were leaving

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.320
I did see them after for a little bit

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.199
and then I was halfway down the stairs

01:13:47.199 --> 01:13:49.040
and I

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.040
thought it's late and I thought like as

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.000
long as I'm sitting here and thinking

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.960
that they're there they're here and and

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.639
all of this thing happened and then I'm

01:13:58.639 --> 01:14:00.760
like when when I'm in the room with them

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.440
they're actually kind of here and and

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.600
not here at the same time like I was

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.120
having this kind of

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.760
like psychedelic kind

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.280
of spiritual Insight just around this

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.040
thing and I ran back up and I said I get

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.400
it like when I leave you're here and

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.199
you're not here at the same time in the

01:14:20.199 --> 01:14:22.080
same way as if you're here if you're

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080
here or not

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.639
you're here and not here at the same

01:14:25.639 --> 01:14:28.159
time when I'm over there but that wasn't

01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:29.760
the Insight the Insight was when I was

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.800
physically in the room with them they're

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.360
also here and not there here at the same

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.760
time because if you

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.800
only concentrate on internal relations

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.080
see we only whad complained we only look

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.520
at actuals and external relations but if

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.080
you live in this world of internal

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.520
relations which is something like

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:52.000
similar to what Anna described then

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.280
there's something else kind of happening

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.280
that's psychoactive right

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:01.440
so so you might say the reason why we

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.600
can have this conversation over Zoom is

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.239
because it's very little

01:15:08.239 --> 01:15:11.159
external relations their external

01:15:11.159 --> 01:15:14.880
relations are are

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.840
Illusions but it works because of the

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.480
internal relations or work in the

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.960
internal relations now you get really

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:24.760
you get really sit down in Collective

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.320
presencing or Collective Insight

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:31.080
practice and think about that

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.320
and so that's kind of what what what can

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:40.040
happen Bonnie what what what I'm

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.080
wondering while you were speaking is

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.199
about I'm not sure if you're familiar

01:15:44.199 --> 01:15:46.520
with David R Hawkins work what's the

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:51.040
last name HK David R Hawkins about his

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.199
one of his books is power versus Force

01:15:54.199 --> 01:15:58.600
and um about what frequency or what

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.800
place are you coming from and it's just

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.480
like the same question you ask what

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.840
reality are we choosing and I wonder is

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.440
if you're in the I am in that spot what

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.000
reality can we choose it's almost like

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.920
multi-dimensional it's like the thing

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.320
this way it's horizontal and vertical

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.199
both at the same time yeah and it's ATT

01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:25.159
tuning with with this tool the

01:16:25.159 --> 01:16:27.360
instrument that we are is almost like

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.800
ATT tuning to what is needed here

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.679
because you know it's this innate

01:16:31.679 --> 01:16:35.520
knowing without without any doubt like

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.480
this is it and this is it oh I don't

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.159
have to do anything or it's like this

01:16:42.159 --> 01:16:45.159
yeah so we just had this horse workshop

01:16:45.159 --> 01:16:47.679
and for some people they wanted to do

01:16:47.679 --> 01:16:49.639
active stuff and learn about horses very

01:16:49.639 --> 01:16:51.320
externally related they needed their

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.000
gestures right some people you just sit

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.159
there and then you can

01:16:56.159 --> 01:16:58.719
feel the relationship moving and

01:16:58.719 --> 01:17:00.400
changing and that the horse is

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.120
interested in you this all internal

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.639
relation call subtle energy or whatever

01:17:06.639 --> 01:17:10.280
but but did you Sandra to answer your

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.560
question did you watch the last video

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.840
for The Parallax course

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:20.280
okay so this is that last

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.080
piece what he's talking about in Holly

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.800
gave me that excerpt actually U from

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.800
that human movie um is that woman looked

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.280
at where he and she were internally

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.639
related despite the fact that he had

01:17:36.639 --> 01:17:40.920
killed her daughter and her

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.159
granddaughter she's like where's the

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:47.159
point of contact and and where does that

01:17:47.159 --> 01:17:48.920
come from well it comes from origin I

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.520
would say I mean this is an origin story

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.679
and so like

01:17:53.679 --> 01:17:57.199
like what if

01:17:57.199 --> 01:18:00.520
I'm able to do both really you know to

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:07.639
to engage in cool external things that

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:11.679
and the point of contact is actually uh

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:14.360
there I would say there as a DST some

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.360
people more up here but um and with

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.040
nature also you know what's the point of

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.880
contact it's like

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.120
this

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:29.520
storm externally I related to it I'm in

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.400
danger but if I go in an is using the I

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.480
am which is the in and this gets loot

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.080
into that the self is a p obstruction is

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:42.320
like then what happens like well you

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.080
could die if you don't get out of the

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.320
way because those are real external

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.520
relations you know and that so

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:52.080
anyways uh I guess I'm talking to this

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.520
to death

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.840
um because my mind can't think of

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.320
anything

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.840
interesting uh because my I'm

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.920
foggy but like Sandra was talking thanks

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.440
Bonnie Sandra was talking about um the

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.600
how do you call them the points

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:19.280
the um I think I've already done the

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.560
biomarkers yeah thanks the biomarkers

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:26.520
and and during our Collective inside

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.000
practice I felt like

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.040
this Vision

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.040
arose here in the solar plexus and then

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.199
it moved to the heart and then you it's

01:19:37.199 --> 01:19:39.960
almost like you can feel

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.400
how the movement in the body or how the

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.560
biomarkers are and then you spoke to it

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:48.639
afterwards as well you said I I believe

01:19:48.639 --> 01:19:52.360
the vision starts here just in the the

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.360
belly area

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.679
higher belly and I thought yeah that's

01:19:55.679 --> 01:19:58.840
where I felt it but there's there

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.480
there's this point of

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.280
relationship from Singularity to

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:07.239
Singularity with Singularity and it's

01:20:07.239 --> 01:20:10.199
like and that's and that's not noise

01:20:10.199 --> 01:20:12.560
that's the signal and and if if I look

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.440
at the scale of stochastic resonance

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.920
it's very very gentle and you almost

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.520
can't hear it it's so subtle that it's I

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.440
don't know what I'm saying but I I want

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.040
to speak to it but I don't I don't have

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.760
words for it but it's this is the this

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.000
knowing of yep we've landed here in

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.800
connection and I'm I'm not in connection

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.639
now I'm just speaking from but I'm going

01:20:35.639 --> 01:20:37.840
back

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.760
um so yeah coming from this place of

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.520
connecting and then speaking from that

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.639
place it's almost like a signal it's

01:20:45.639 --> 01:20:48.360
signaling out instead of noising or

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:51.719
creating noise and that's a

01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:53.400
big

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.080
distinction to make because who am I

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.719
talking to like now who am I am I

01:20:58.719 --> 01:21:00.400
talking to myself because I want to make

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.199
sense to myself or you know it's it's

01:21:04.199 --> 01:21:07.760
it's like it's like this 380

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760
thing I don't know what I'm saying I'll

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.440
leave it I'll leave it for

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.080
now no this is very rich and so this is

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.520
kind of very similar to Collective

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.719
Insight practice because you're

01:21:20.719 --> 01:21:23.760
just it's like a little pop corny right

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.320
we're not trying to

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.280
like um but it reminds me of this

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.120
exercise you do with the horses like

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.520
first they bond with you and then

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.159
um I have people walk a few steps ahead

01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:44.880
and kind of waver like this whether

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.159
whether or not the horse is going to

01:21:46.159 --> 01:21:48.960
come with them or not and the

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:51.960
horse this happened many times this

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.199
weekend

01:21:53.199 --> 01:21:56.520
um so the horse is obviously bonded with

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.639
them and they're standing completely

01:21:58.639 --> 01:22:02.320
still and I'll say oh do you have your

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.760
attention on the horse back there and

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.880
they'll say yes I'm like well you've

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.280
pinned yourself there so he won't

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.600
move well then how do I know if the

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.480
horse is with me I said you don't it's

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.719
not an external relation you feel it in

01:22:17.719 --> 01:22:21.520
here now how is that possible how is it

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.679
possible well I think what some some of

01:22:23.679 --> 01:22:25.560
the thing you're saying is I feel it

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.840
here but it's

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:29.679
not it's not like there's subtle energy

01:22:29.679 --> 01:22:31.360
that's coming from me and being shared

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.600
with the horse because that's an

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.719
external relation it's like there's a

01:22:34.719 --> 01:22:37.159
signal that is

01:22:37.159 --> 01:22:39.719
triangulated like that and I would say

01:22:39.719 --> 01:22:42.199
that signal is the first amoeba or

01:22:42.199 --> 01:22:47.719
whatever you know so uh so you're this a

01:22:47.719 --> 01:22:50.440
very you see this is what we're doing is

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:53.600
we're creating whole do

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:56.199
we still have frames and directions and

01:22:56.199 --> 01:22:57.840
stuff but it's getting it's getting

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.639
interesting and

01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:06.920
Rich when you said earlier Bonnie about

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:11.400
um Wilbur saying kind of after you this

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.440
Awakening the words don't matter or you

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.560
any word will

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.280
do and

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:23.280
that that's

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.400
feels like that's the

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.920
experience now in a way that the words

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.080
are just this but there's

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.400
something

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:41.320
else and I'm reminded of using um chat

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:45.199
GPT yesterday for the first time and

01:23:45.199 --> 01:23:49.120
reading what it put out and went oh God

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.080
it's so

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.440
like every other word was a buzzword

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.520
that made the whole thing make no sense

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.520
at at some level made the whole thing

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:06.120
nonsensical and yet it was organized

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.880
and sentence by

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.600
sentence was like it was a McKenzie

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.040
report yeah it was crazy I've just never

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.920
you know I never spent any time with it

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.040
I won't spend any time with it in the

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.920
near future but just the difference

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.480
between something

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.920
that comes from the struggle of finding

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.719
a word that's just a word but maybe

01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:42.400
gets resonance or connection I don't

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.360
know it's it's not about the

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.000
words there's something

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.360
else

01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.320
with this this origin

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.320
story are we looking for something maybe

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.760
closer to like a pure abstraction as

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.760
opposed to just like an

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.960
imaginary like I don't know if I'm using

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.040
those words right probably yes you are

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.760
using that right

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:23.159
um

01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:26.600
you you you end Story the pure

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:28.520
abstraction

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:31.719
um and to get to the pure

01:25:31.719 --> 01:25:37.800
abstraction you make metaphors I mean so

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.320
um so one of one thing we might say is

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.840
what Anna just

01:25:46.679 --> 01:25:49.280
described so the the story is really

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.080
origins of the body and instead of a big

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.360
bang which is an

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.880
event maybe there was something like a

01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.560
body in the same way we experience what

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.360
she just described is what happened at

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.440
the beginning of time because that's

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.800
what bodies

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.000
do except in this case there's no

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.520
external signal right that it is the

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.280
signal and its internal relationship at

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.280
the same time because this is just the

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.119
way our

01:26:25.119 --> 01:26:30.280
epistemic works but

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.000
um yeah I could inore

01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:54.199
that

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.920
I wonder how much

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.600
of discovering new origin stories comes

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.760
with new ways of looking at old ones so

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.960
like the big bang you know we we have a

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.360
bunch of presumably we have a bunch of

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.040
telescopes everywhere and the

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.280
telescopes are pointed at the universe

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.159
and different parts of it looking at

01:27:15.159 --> 01:27:17.719
very far away places but you can think

01:27:17.719 --> 01:27:18.880
about it

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.280
like you know you know how in uh Road

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.480
Runner

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.000
and the Wy coyote how the Road Runner

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.159
sometimes just like paints a fake tunnel

01:27:30.159 --> 01:27:32.159
a fake tunnel on the on the Rock and

01:27:32.159 --> 01:27:33.600
then he goes through and then the coyote

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.040
just runs into it like what if there's

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.760
just like some trickster God that just

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:40.080
knows where all of our telescopes are

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.520
and then every time we buil a new one he

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.480
just puts like this little this little

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.600
fake

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.159
tunnel with a painted thing on it so

01:27:47.159 --> 01:27:48.560
then every time we look at it you know

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.840
it's like we're back in Plato's Cave

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.880
we're just like oh he's playing a trick

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.000
on us it's like oh the telescopes aren't

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.440
actually showing us the truth but it's

01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:00.960
some like weird mathematical physics

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.960
Contraption that's there to trick us to

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.840
thinking that the Big Bang has happened

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.880
I think this is actually true except we

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.920
don't know what what the Distortion is

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.199
um so for example you've seen that

01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:15.400
picture it's like a big eye and it's

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.440
it's it shows you and as you go toward

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.280
the circumference it's it's it's farther

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:23.800
and farther

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.320
time so the thing about that is that

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.800
from every single position you see the

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.920
same thing like it's not a sphere

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.440
because in a sphere if you were inside a

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.760
sphere if you were over here you would

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:38.239
be closer to here and for it's not like

01:28:38.239 --> 01:28:41.880
that it's like every single person is in

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:45.639
the center of that and and any every

01:28:45.639 --> 01:28:49.960
single perspective sees the same

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.080
thing in in this picture and then so

01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.760
then I'll ask so every single

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.840
perspective sees the same

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:04.360
thing well let me say this some

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.119
perspectives seem more because well I

01:29:07.119 --> 01:29:08.480
don't know it doesn't matter every

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.239
single perspective sees the same thing

01:29:11.239 --> 01:29:14.520
and what you're seeing

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.400
is

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.470
time so then I ask well where's

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:20.920
[Music]

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.920
tomorrow

01:29:27.119 --> 01:29:29.159
in that

01:29:29.159 --> 01:29:31.320
perspective right

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:35.840
there not there yet it's like you're

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.080
constantly backing up somehow but what

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.480
does that even mean so this is f you

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.719
know this is the reality that physicists

01:29:45.719 --> 01:29:49.840
are painting it's not any less more

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:52.639
weird it's not any less weird than some

01:29:52.639 --> 01:29:56.600
of these Explorations we're we're

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.639
having um it's not a question you can

01:29:59.639 --> 01:30:04.320
ask but it's an interesting question to

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:15.040
ask that which would mean that time is

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:18.040
emanating from every perspective in all

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.840
directions at the same

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.840
time

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.360
I'm thinking about my grandson when he

01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:33.360
was like he wasn't even two and he was

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.719
trying to understand the word

01:30:36.719 --> 01:30:40.360
yesterday and he would say Nester day

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:43.000
the day before the day before the day

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.520
before but he just could was like what

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:48.320
is

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.119
yesterday that same sense of what's

01:30:51.119 --> 01:30:55.040
tomorrow right what's

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:07.080
tomorrow this is a bit off topic but

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.480
that story just reminded me of I

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:11.040
remember having a memory when I was

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.080
really young my mom wanted to make a

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:16.199
leftand turn in the car so she had to

01:31:16.199 --> 01:31:18.800
cross one lane to get to the other but

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.320
there was cars coming both ways and then

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:23.800
there was a in the in the lane that we

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.800
wanted to get into but the left hand

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:28.960
lane was still going and I just could

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.320
not understand why we couldn't go I

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.199
didn't understand why the left one we're

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:38.800
going in is free but there was cars

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.400
coming the other way I could not

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.760
understand it for the life of me I don't

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.320
know

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.800
why it's kind of

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.760
funny

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:02.800
maybe it's something to do with

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.320
like I don't know I feel like that kind

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.560
of shows

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.920
how I don't know maybe something to do

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.119
with like how understanding works or

01:32:13.119 --> 01:32:15.440
how how

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.040
many assumptions and things we have to

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.080
actually

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.800
train our minds to do that now maybe we

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.040
just think it's so obvious in reality

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:30.639
where no we actually had to learn that

01:32:30.639 --> 01:32:35.880
and like do something to figure that

01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:42.600
out but you didn't learn it

01:32:44.199 --> 01:32:46.880
dialogically one day you just

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.280
knew yeah yeah exactly and so this is

01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.119
what I'm saying this is how trying to

01:32:52.119 --> 01:32:54.880
learn to address these questions not you

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:58.080
know more from like can I change my

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.239
perspect where shift this is really good

01:33:00.239 --> 01:33:01.880
because we're shifting like I loved

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.840
Kevin's story it sounds

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.360
like it sounds like it's parenthetical

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.719
but it's very interesting story as we're

01:33:09.719 --> 01:33:14.560
shifting like like what's what's going

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.280
on

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.239
the question always comes up in my mind

01:33:25.239 --> 01:33:27.239
though is

01:33:27.239 --> 01:33:30.280
like it it comes up

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.280
like there's always this division

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:35.119
between okay we're making this story and

01:33:35.119 --> 01:33:38.840
about reality or

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:41.360
whatever um and that could have very

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.920
profound implications like we just

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.040
talked about on behavior and how we see

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.960
the world and interact and stuff but

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.560
then what's actually going on in

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.560
reality to me that those two seem to

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:59.199
come up always in kind of different

01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:23.480
spots

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.040
I think that raises a question for me

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.400
Matt

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:29.159
about how does

01:35:29.159 --> 01:35:33.320
our assuming that we find create

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.840
something is emerging called an origin

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.040
story how does

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:46.119
that situate Us in reality or

01:35:46.119 --> 01:35:50.360
what what role does that play in our

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.400
relationship with

01:36:02.159 --> 01:36:04.920
reality coming up for me is um that

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.400
conversation I think Bonnie had with

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:10.119
like Veri and she talked about the it

01:36:10.119 --> 01:36:11.480
you know you can't actually be in

01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.880
relationship with the it but that it

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:16.199
loves us you know that it loves us so

01:36:16.199 --> 01:36:17.320
much

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:20.360
and um that can completely change a

01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:22.880
narrative for me you know like going

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.840
from having certain constraints come

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.840
into life and feeling like a victim but

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.880
if I return to that kind of origin story

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.000
that it loves me it I become less of a

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.760
victim and more um becomes more of

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.800
this I don't know trust trust becomes

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.639
alive and um trust and

01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.280
surrender

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.320
yeah I think it's it's one thing and

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:06.000
it's very very good to do gratitude

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.600
practices but if it's paired with an

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:14.119
origin story like that then wow you know

01:37:14.119 --> 01:37:17.440
like I don't have to be grateful to see

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:22.159
again I'm grateful to it versus the

01:37:22.159 --> 01:37:24.600
incredible

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.320
gratitude as it expresses

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.040
itself and hly arises or something you

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.760
know is

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.320
is it predisposes a person in a

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:43.000
different way to act more like this and

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.440
less like

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:47.599
that um and it's very subtle right it's

01:37:47.599 --> 01:37:49.800
very beautiful to do gratitude

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:51.760
practices but

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:54.840
[Music]

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:57.920
to have this other Insight that you

01:37:57.920 --> 01:37:59.960
you're not externally related to it so

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:02.440
it's there's something much more intense

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.719
and rich in

01:38:14.719 --> 01:38:17.800
that yeah that you're just swimming in

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.119
it or swaddle

01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:23.000
SWAT yeah something like that I think

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.320
we're saying the same thing but why does

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:28.800
it matter because it slightly changes

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.199
your one is really good the other

01:38:32.199 --> 01:38:35.199
one

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.440
uh predisposes a different it changes

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:40.280
the

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.719
story I don't have to be grateful for it

01:38:42.719 --> 01:38:45.080
grateful for it grateful for it you know

01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:48.159
then little by little I owe it something

01:38:48.159 --> 01:38:50.119
but it's really hard to

01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:53.520
just come to terms with the

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:56.080
Incredible Gift of being a living human

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.840
being none of

01:38:59.159 --> 01:39:02.480
which you deserved or had to do anything

01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.440
for or

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:07.560
[Music]

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:17.480
um it's the one hand clapping right it's

01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:20.280
only you can't be in a DI what would

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.360
they would say Di itical relationship

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.040
with it your mind will do that and then

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.679
it'll go back and forth and we'll talk

01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:30.040
about it and talk about it yeah

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.239
k um I so I I grew up religious too but

01:39:38.239 --> 01:39:41.040
Buddhist um and in

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:43.639
Buddhism because like but my dad's Irish

01:39:43.639 --> 01:39:46.840
Catholic but I didn't I don't really so

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:48.280
I don't know much about that but I grew

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:49.400
up mainly Buddhist because that's where

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:51.960
I was born um

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.080
so I do that's like really unusual for

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.520
me to be like oh I owe because like in

01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:01.280
the Buddhist origin story it's like if

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.320
you're alive the world wanted you to be

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.639
alive because it allowed you to be

01:40:06.639 --> 01:40:10.040
alive um so something to do with like

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:14.280
aliveness like yeah

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.080
like I think but the but the

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.520
gratefulness to me just mean because I

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.040
love being alive because I want to be

01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.360
alive so it's just like natural when I

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.800
think about it like I'm grateful because

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.719
I'm like yeah and because I'm natur

01:40:26.719 --> 01:40:30.000
seeing nature I feel like everything

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.560
wants to be alive because I'm also we're

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.239
all nature or something yeah so like if

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:39.480
you're alive that's just like

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.199
what it wanted to

01:40:42.199 --> 01:40:44.080
happen like so you don't you don't

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.480
really owe anything yeah unless

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:49.920
Christians

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:54.880
oh we owe um yeah and even some Western

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.880
Buddhists they appropriate this notion

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:01.239
of you have to justify yourself you know

01:41:01.239 --> 01:41:03.920
because the culture is so heavily

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.080
inundated with that I love what you what

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.920
you said to to really we're just

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:12.560
thriving as it it is a weird word but

01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:15.119
we're just we're it

01:41:15.119 --> 01:41:18.639
thriving um

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.840
yeah

01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:29.719
and of course one might argue that the

01:41:29.719 --> 01:41:32.140
impulse to return the

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:33.480
[Music]

01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:36.719
debt drives a lot of the horrible things

01:41:36.719 --> 01:41:41.639
we do like to like

01:41:41.639 --> 01:41:45.040
because any attempt to improve on a

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:49.480
fundamental L level layer is a

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:52.280
distortion on a fundamental level I

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:57.040
can't improve the lifegiving

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.159
source I can't do better than nature at

01:42:04.159 --> 01:42:07.560
make at creating life um but

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.719
then yeah there's something that drives

01:42:10.719 --> 01:42:13.719
westerners to pay back the debt or

01:42:13.719 --> 01:42:15.119
eliminate the

01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:18.119
debt

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.840
um

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.080
it's deep deep in our upbringing even if

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.679
we don't believe the story when we're

01:42:25.679 --> 01:42:28.320
adults

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.360
yeah um I I don't know like when because

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:38.119
when I read like stuff in Tha like

01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:40.599
that's like spiritual I don't know is it

01:42:40.599 --> 01:42:42.320
like also like Western but I'm Western

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.920
too but it's just like I don't know like

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.320
we don't believe we're animals as well

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.000
or something as well that's a big part

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.800
of it so it's weird like it's like weird

01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:52.360
decision making yeah weird we wear an

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:55.560
animal as well like that's really like

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.920
pushed in like Buddhist text that I read

01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:59.400
in Tai like it's just like we're also

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:02.880
like another animal I don't know no I

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:04.159
mean that's what we do here you know

01:43:04.159 --> 01:43:06.040
putting the Mind back into the body and

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.960
the body back into nature we talk a lot

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.760
about our animal nature and then in the

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.719
west we have all these cut

01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:17.239
offs okay so it's hard to describe the

01:43:17.239 --> 01:43:18.760
kind like some like if you look at a

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:23.159
virus is it alive or is it said well the

01:43:23.159 --> 01:43:26.599
words are too coarse but I do believe

01:43:26.599 --> 01:43:28.920
that it's continuous all the way down if

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.880
my words could describe every little

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.639
refinement and this is more of a

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:35.119
Buddhist sensibility and it's just I

01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:36.400
mean you don't sit around and talk about

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.119
it because it's just obvious and in the

01:43:39.119 --> 01:43:42.800
west we want to believe that because we

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.440
believe that this fragmented self we

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.599
have is why we're destroying the earth

01:43:47.599 --> 01:43:50.719
and the animals um but it's different

01:43:50.719 --> 01:43:53.199
from wanting to believe it to just it's

01:43:53.199 --> 01:43:56.960
obvious to you you know um and

01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:02.840
so yeah I love that and

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:09.040
um we talked about in the popup school

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:12.520
like people can can create simulations

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:14.920
in their mind but so can

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:19.159
animals the bee can do the dance to tell

01:44:19.159 --> 01:44:20.920
the other bees where the food is and

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:23.000
that's an abstraction you know anything

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:26.800
that now I'm not saying humans aren as

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:28.719
far as we know one of the things humans

01:44:28.719 --> 01:44:31.119
can do that animals don't do is simulate

01:44:31.119 --> 01:44:34.080
the self and in Buddhism this is the

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.520
problem like I can simulate the

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.159
environment and we can talk about oh you

01:44:39.159 --> 01:44:41.560
know when we go there let's have Nancy

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.280
sit with John so we're Sim but when you

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.520
simulate the self this is a big problem

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:50.599
because then the self starts to run dis

01:44:50.599 --> 01:44:52.800
other thing and as far as I know animals

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.280
don't do that that's what I would say

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.119
is the lovely prerogative of people and

01:44:59.119 --> 01:45:02.199
it's certainly a the point of which the

01:45:02.199 --> 01:45:03.639
Buddhists try

01:45:03.639 --> 01:45:07.280
to um yeah eliminate

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:11.000
or dampen at

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:19.480
least a lot of a lot of you know Western

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.239
Buddhists they simulate the self and

01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:24.320
that's the self they want to awaken you

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.960
know that's the self that goes to the

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:29.320
meditation cushion and tries to

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:35.599
improve uh that's very hard hard

01:45:35.599 --> 01:45:39.199
um it's very hard for westerners to

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:42.199
see

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:46.440
because when you believe that yourself

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:48.639
is part and continuous animals and

01:45:48.639 --> 01:45:50.760
nature then the grounding goes goes

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.960
right down there something

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.040
concrete without that you have this

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.880
other problem where you're going to

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:00.719
situate yourself in some kind of like

01:46:00.719 --> 01:46:02.520
imaginary

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.040
context yeah thank you for that I

01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:16.639
mean

01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:19.679
stop she says you're an animal and I'm a

01:46:19.679 --> 01:46:22.400
person too

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:26.520
she wants it to work both

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:35.360
ways okay I'm thinking that with that we

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.840
should um I love that with that

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:41.639
inspiration that yes it is possible it's

01:46:41.639 --> 01:46:43.880
the rest of the world many people in the

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.880
rest of the world um it's it's a a

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:50.960
fundamental truth um and hopefully we

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:56.239
can move ourselves to that here um and

01:46:56.239 --> 01:46:58.119
thank you for uh putting up with me I'm

01:46:58.119 --> 01:47:01.440
just kind of sluggish and um but I feel

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:04.119
that healing energy and um I'll see you

01:47:04.119 --> 01:47:07.000
on Saturday thank you C for showing up

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.599
gives us

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.280
hope I love you so much Bonita you give

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:19.280
me hope like literally I'm like obsessed

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:21.400
with you like

01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.920
you internally change or internally

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.360
inside me or something yeah yeah yeah

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.159
hopefully I just give you confidence for

01:47:30.159 --> 01:47:31.960
what you already know I mean that's

01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.520
that's really the work so much I was

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.280
like I know it but every time I read you

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:42.199
I'm like oh I knew it yeah yeah yeah

01:47:42.199 --> 01:47:45.560
thank you deep gratitude thank you my

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.560
friends



## Cohort 5

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.839
okay all righty all

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.000
righty we're still a little

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.960
Sicky it's

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.839
amazing that I've been sleeping for 18

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.240
hours a day and uh having no problem

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.359
doing that and now I understand what

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.199
it's like to be a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.960
cat um that this is a possible way to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.320
live

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.200
um okay so hi

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.160
everybody

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.039
um this is the last session on the

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.879
origins story uh or the origins of the

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.320
body and

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.520
um you know one of the things we haven't

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.920
talked a lot about is we want to tell an

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
origin story in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.920
which

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.360
we stretch we stretch

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.000
[Music]

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.040
the definition of a body so whatever it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.280
is that's there at the beginning is also

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.880
a body um so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.640
um um we haven't talked a lot about that

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.479
but I was just going over the uh

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.680
beginning post again um yeah so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.399
um May maybe I'll just open it up um for

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.439
where um I don't know any comments or or

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.720
discussions on um this notion of Origins

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.479
and then I'll say a little bit about a

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.960
segue between this one and the next one

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.719
and anything we want to talk about if

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.520
you've been listening to videos anything

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.960
that popped up for you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.560
um um you could do that in breakouts do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.799
you want to go into breakouts you want

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.439
to do it in this large

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.360
group 61 half dozen other let's just

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.560
stay here for now and then

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.119
uh yeah um because we don't have

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.120
anything particularly particular topic

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.519
to uh Orient ourselves so let the games

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.800
begin my brain is working a little

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.879
better today so uh that's good

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.760
news

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.200
one of the things that's interesting to

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.040
me is that there are origin stories that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.360
I used to find

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.319
unsatisfying because like they don't

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.480
explain how matter arose or something

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.080
like that right

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.400
but they do explain or they they they

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.920
talk about the origin of something like

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.959
the origin of how things are now versus

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.280
the origin of how it all came to be

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.239
so I'm just imp playing with this idea

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.360
of the difference between looking for a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.040
origin story or gathering a collection

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.319
of origin stories so in the beginning

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.640
versus in the beginnings like in one of

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.920
the beginnings some this is what

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.640
happened

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.000
um yeah I'm thinking a lot of about

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.040
these like old origin stories like

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.200
um like

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.840
in the beginning the Earth was

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.760
flat and coyote was roaming around and a

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.239
plant said if you eat me you're going to

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.720
 yourself and Coyote's like no I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.480
won't myself and I'll eat the plant

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.439
and he started and that's how

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.640
the Earth kind of gains form right like

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.040
it's there's there's all these

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.640
like I don't know there's I have a

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.239
desire for a new origin story I also

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.959
have a desire to look at all these old

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.760
origin stories and see

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.400
what they were actually pointing

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.959
at that's all I

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.799
got well that's really interesting

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.040
because it made me I'm just going to

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.600
write it down is we're going to go into

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.680
the origins of

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680
culture and

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.040
they they're embedded right

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.240
so it's easier to tell the origins of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.000
culture because we can trace it's traced

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.960
back through different

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.600
mechanisms um in the historical record

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.039
but in from one

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.080
view you know first you have the origin

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.600
of the universe which gives rise to

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.639
culture but from another view you have

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.120
to have

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.880
culture to tell an origin

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.720
story so it's kind of

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.759
like a lot of what the origins of

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.840
culture R is a common origin story

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.199
of yeah this interesting entanglement

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.479
upside down inside out kind of thing

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.840
there want maybe add to that because I

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.560
think with a lot of the older

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.840
mythologies one of the things I find

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.319
always a little bit difficult or

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.039
frustrating is that the way they

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.039
describe the characters or the

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.759
figures that are at work in the kind of

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.039
early causation they have these

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.759
properties which already suggest a very

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.560
rich and complex context and so it's

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.880
like it doesn't answer the how do you

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.840
get context from from nothing question

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.600
there's already a kind of implicit prior

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.680
context and I always find that quite

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.039
frustrating so it's like or or it's like

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.759
well what is it what is this you know

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.800
it's not uh it's not really an origin

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.479
story it's a kind of something else it's

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.479
yeah

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.039
I've been listening and it's

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.960
fascinating what everyone has said

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.440
origin

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.319
stories and I I love the simulation

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.120
Theory that's going around almost like

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.720
from one mind whether it's God or the

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.720
conscious energy field but within it I

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.120
found my own narrative that I've been

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.080
trying to understand and that's like my

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.599
origin story for my continuation of my

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:45.199
so-called Dharma which is you all know

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.720
I'm in my second generation passing

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.919
things on passing the torch on more or

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.160
less but still maintaining activity

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.440
within it so I just have my own

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.800
simulation story

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.120
narrative that carries me on I just I

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.080
just love that simulation aspect

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.400
whatever wherever it came from whether

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.240
it's God or and then within it are

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.960
multitudes of little creation stories

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.800
that all feed the

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.680
whole John can you say more about the

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.360
simulation like what what what's the

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.720
simulation

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.039
story well I don't know it's going

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:29.720
around in uh it's related to quantum

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.960
mechanics I suppose and Bonnie could

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.879
talk about it a lot more than I but uh

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:40.080
it's just uh one great mind is instead

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.919
of uh back to the Creator you know

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:45.120
creating things in seven days which is

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.199
somewhat ridiculous um it formulated in

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.800
uh that was allowed to just manifest

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.360
through

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.720
time and

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.599
uh whether it's uh God's creation or

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.960
or or it was allowed to happen through

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.000
the one mind that branched off in the

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.440
multitude of Minds I can't really talk

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.479
about it very

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:12.960
effectively but uh it it's it's out

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.280
there people are talking about

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.280
it I love the uh the story you told and

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.639
I think that all fits in within it and

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.360
then tying to a multitude of different

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.759
cultures that formulated around it

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:34.640
around all those stories and branched

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.159
out I don't

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:41.719
know that's just

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.880
interesting Bonnie I'm curious I mean

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.279
I've missed most of these sessions

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:06.440
except for the first one and I know you

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.959
were maybe hoping for some artifact to

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.880
arise how do I mean how does one know

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.880
when one's caught how do you know when

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.440
you've caught An Origin

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.959
story I mean I have a lot of notes and a

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:25.399
lot of things are working up

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.240
um um how do you know when one's caught

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.120
in origin

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.279
story I think it's not a matter of so

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:45.720
who said this let's see where is he

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.760
Steve I think yeah Steve said it it's

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.040
kind of

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.040
like

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.079
um we're in service okay it's just like

00:09:57.079 --> 00:09:59.839
imagination right imagin uh no memory

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.839
memory is in service to the moment we

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:03.160
remember we were saying how like you

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.480
don't really remember anything it keeps

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.240
updated because it's in service to the

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.519
presence well this is sort of what our

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:13.560
project is here we're not we're not dumb

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.279
enough to think we can find the origin

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.320
story um we're looking for an origin

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.399
story that serves um the situation we're

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:31.040
in now um that will help

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.680
steer people toward preferred Futures

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.680
right so An Origin story that makes it

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.959
that is very

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:43.440
plausible that

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.519
um puts the Mind back into the body and

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:48.800
the body back into nature okay so

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.000
simulation as a origin story doesn't

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.680
really do that it kind of It kind of

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.560
says like the body's in a simulation

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.680
which is more like a information Theory

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.800
s LR so that's that's an alternative but

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.480
our purpose is axiomatic to we just say

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.880
we want to do this because we're

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.200
destroying our environment and this is

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.160
why we're doing it now I can't

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.959
then explain why or Justify my purpose

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:19.399
right I'm just this is this is a project

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:23.600
and it's axiomatic to that

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.600
so

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.920
um so in that sense it's very practical

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.079
but the second part is on that's on this

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:36.480
side this side of the creation process

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.600
the other side is um you're

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.600
hoping

00:11:43.839 --> 00:11:49.120
that by some Quirk of history and

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.880
fate people read

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.440
it

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.600
and it lands in a way like this is what

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.000
happened to Wilbur right before Wilbur

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.360
nobody knew what he said everybody that

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.040
read Wilbur is like I knew that all

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.680
along it was so self-evident the way he

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.480
put it together right because something

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.560
in them it was latent in them uh you

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.959
know a whole generation of people this

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:18.279
is not for everyone mostly young um men

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.680
it was a certain demographic and it

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.800
became like he articulated something

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.880
that was

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.600
completely uh present in a in a

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.639
subconscious way to people and they had

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:31.440
an organized it and so that's what I

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.199
would say An Origin story that lands has

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:37.160
those two aspects to it it it lands on

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.320
this end

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.360
because there are

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.199
certain choices made that are axiomatic

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:46.639
to our purpose um this is something for

00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:51.600
example that I've constantly am confused

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.240
about like John Veri like obviously out

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.440
of all the things he could draw in to do

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.000
a synoptic integration he chooses some

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.360
and not others same with us but why you

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.240
know you never know what like what is

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.160
what you

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.920
know uh Jordan Peterson is a little more

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.959
obvious because he's more obvious you

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.639
know he's fighting woke and he's

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:17.639
fighting post-modernism he's fighting a

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:22.240
certain cultural kind of momentum so you

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.240
can you he he's gonna interpret

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.800
Pinocchio in a certain way and he's

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.360
gonna inter you know Jonathan Pou he's

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.800
he's

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.240
he you know he's so you can see that

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.680
that there's these purposeful aims on

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.399
you know for certain people because you

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:42.440
can't synoptically integrate everything

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.519
um so that's on our end but the hope is

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:49.160
is that you've got some kind

00:13:51.839 --> 00:13:55.440
of sensing into what people are starving

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.880
for because if if if now you can't make

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.320
that up like that's why I said some

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.680
Quirk of history and timing and stuff

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.240
like that because you can't but that

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.800
somehow um you're living in the moment

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.040
and you can articulate the moment in a

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.240
way that coales that coales is for a lot

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.199
of people and and

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:21.720
um and

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.360
um that would be the purpose of an

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.240
origin story so when Wilbur wrote up

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.079
from Eden so kind it's an origin story

00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.000
and it

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.320
just uh it just

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.720
situated what people were experiencing

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.079
again it's a very small demographic but

00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:43.279
this demographic just got SW you know

00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:46.720
was really like you know a blueprint and

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.720
you know the left hand fitting the left

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.639
hand and the right hand fitting together

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:55.639
um so that's what you're trying trying I

00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:56.600
would

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.880
say that would be did that answer your

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.720
question that would be what a successful

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.839
origin story origin story is just a part

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:06.399
of the project as I wrote um but that

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:10.160
would be um a successful origin story

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.880
and then the larger project has those

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.279
other aspects to it that that I wrote in

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:18.160
the pitch yeah it was a gorgeous

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.480
response and that's exactly the

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.000
experience I had when I read up from

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.680
Eden 20 years ago yeah it's like two

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.920
hands matching and and that's why

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.360
everybody else you know it didn't take

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.920
long where people were like oh that's

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.880
self-evident you know it was like it was

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.319
like they made it up themselves because

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:35.959
something in them was already

00:15:35.959 --> 00:15:39.160
self-evident to them

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.079
um but that doesn't take away the

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:46.639
extraordinary um effort that or

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:49.839
accomplishment to make it articulate it

00:15:49.839 --> 00:15:53.480
in a way that it became self-evident you

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.680
know so

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.920
uh that's part of it that's part of it

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.959
so part of it is having this purposeful

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:05.279
thing and hoping that that is

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:08.160
timely um because if it's not it won't

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.000
work and then having a sense

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:20.160
that yeah what

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.240
what what are people like starving for

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.160
you know um that they don't even know

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.639
they're starving for but as soon as they

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:30.519
see it then it it just lands so

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:32.639
something like

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:35.480
that yeah I can relate to that that's

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.560
like my narrative story is tied to 30

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.959
years old of of trying to bring my

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:43.639
purpose in life forward into helping in

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:47.000
my aspect of that which will tie into

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.560
more of your outer line aspect of uh

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.720
developing something for the future of

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.720
humanity which I think part of my

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.720
narrative is trying to do too but but

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.440
I'm not in the bigger picture of it

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.040
that's one reason I I'm wanting to go I

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.280
have signed up for your June course next

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.199
year so I'm planning on that but I'm

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:12.839
hoping I can take my therapy uh service

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:16.280
dog along who's very good if that would

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.480
be okay because the last time I

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.240
believe you'll have to last year she oh

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.679
she ran away okay yeah when I leave her

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:29.039
okay I think it's okay you'll have the

00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:31.039
when it launches the public site

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:33.880
launches um I'm not organizing it it's

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.360
Brian and Sky Meadow um so they'll be

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.160
able to answer your questions but I get

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.400
the impression that that's okay um okay

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.039
but she was good at she was good at a

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:46.160
silent Retreat and she didn't talk till

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.200
it was legal to

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.320
talk yeah so but uh you know you'll be

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.600
able to be in touch with them I'm not

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.360
I'm not in charge of

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.840
that okay good thank you I'm not even

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.200
sure they let let me

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.880
go they haven't haven't they haven't

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.919
told me yet but part of my simulation is

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.679
my narrative that I can fit into uh

00:18:09.679 --> 00:18:12.360
other narratives that keep growing and

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.840
expanding and we talked about simulation

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.799
once upon a time during our past year

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:20.919
yeah we talked about that um one of the

00:18:20.919 --> 00:18:23.320
things what we call mind is that it it

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.400
it runs simulations and that animal

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.799
animals can run simulations too and you

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:31.960
know so that would be an example of for

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.600
example um telling that story which is

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.880
just kind of actually true um means

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.080
means a lot to people that that okay to

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.600
to know that animals run simulations

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.159
too means maybe that simulations didn't

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:52.000
just like were not

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.360
just a drift in simulations and the rest

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.000
of the animal kingdom is is some somehow

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.919
different you know so that would be uh a

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:06.520
purposeful story

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.640
Justin I'm going to ramble a little bit

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.720
I think but I'm going to start I mean

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.320
the origin of the cosmos the universe

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.240
fascinates me but it's not an answerable

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.679
question really like what happened we

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:21.679
don't know but it does fascinate me

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:24.120
nevertheless more

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.200
locally Cosmic dust compacted and when

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.960
it got hot enough and dense enough it

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.320
ignited we have a star and all life on

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.120
this planet came from the radiation from

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.280
that star that's an origin story as far

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.080
as I'm concerned but it doesn't mean

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.960
anything now I will say that for me

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.440
there has been some kind of lifelong I

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.720
would say gravitational pull that I am

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.760
tuned to that is pulling is beckoning me

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.360
as a better word in a particular

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.440
direction I am following that I don't

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.200
assign any meaning to it I don't have a

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.799
story about it I know what it feels like

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:00.000
and I know that

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.080
I'm sort

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.000
of I'm not obliged to follow it but I

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.840
have chosen to

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.799
somehow I don't even know that that was

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:13.000
a conscious choice but I'm doing that

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.440
and wherever it leads me that's I'm

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.200
going and I don't need a story I don't

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.919
at least that's my current

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.679
position yeah so underneath what you're

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:27.360
saying you may not be excuse me saying

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.760
this but

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.240
part of an origin

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.960
story should tap

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.960
into

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.120
um if you if you can tell the origin

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.520
story right and this is what I think

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.080
your experien is you may be able to pull

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.520
off that something in your experience

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.520
today

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.320
um is the same pattern that you can be

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.120
in touch with that was there since the

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.760
origin right that that

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.760
somehow

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:09.240
um like what did I say in the pitch that

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.320
the the patterns of the universe can be

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.799
discovered in the patterns that make us

00:21:14.799 --> 00:21:16.880
feel more alive I mean you know it's a

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.840
pitch statement so there's a little bit

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.080
of that in it but I do believe that

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.320
[Music]

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.600
um

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.559
that a technically correct or

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:31.840
technically good origin story would

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.320
because see the whole book

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.039
um is based upon a framework where

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:41.559
instead of having a metaphysics that

00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:43.840
stands by itself it has a what I call a

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.360
metaphysics of experience that by

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.080
attending to experience

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.640
directly and I don't mean in the Vasa

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.840
way

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.880
because that's more of an anal

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.799
logical

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:02.440
uh

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.320
uh analytic um deconstruction but more

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.440
like you describe like just you're just

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.320
attending to something keep attending to

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.760
it and somehow there's this this sense

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:19.799
that what you're attending to is

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:21.360
originary

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.600
and so from a metaphysics experience you

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.120
should be able at different levels of

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.600
depth

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.360
defined in your

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.720
experience the same patterns that go

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.320
back further and further versus just

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.720
having an origin story that is just an

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.080
imaginary that that is just a story and

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.919
that would be um something that is in

00:22:46.919 --> 00:22:52.039
the frame of of the work so

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:57.480
um you still have to end story it right

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.520
you still have to say okay this feels

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.440
like it's come you know this this

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.559
feeling is like must be the vibration

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:07.440
that's been here for a long time blah

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.799
blah blah and then you can inore it in

00:23:09.799 --> 00:23:13.440
origin story but hopefully that that's

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.840
something about your people's current

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.679
experience will be directly

00:23:20.679 --> 00:23:25.600
reflected in the origin story um

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.720
yeah well I think that now thinking

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.760
about I do have a kind of a story about

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.520
it and is you know I have children and

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.240
with an infant they're totally

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.640
completely unfocused they're just like

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.480
you know mine were both completely

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.159
different from day one but they're very

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:42.559
different but they are completely

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:46.559
unfocused um so but I do have this

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:50.279
notion and I guess it is the story that

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:52.240
I

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.080
intended to have this

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.240
experience I do have that that notion

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.480
and that as the tension narrowed I lost

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.200
track of the intention and that's what's

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.880
pulling me is that

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.240
intention and that's a story but it's

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.400
the one I'm using currently yeah

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.600
yeah um okay

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.559
good um we'll get to some other things

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:20.840
later

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.279
Marie

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:28.799
um yeah this might be off

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:34.360
topic um but I'm I'm I'm here

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.760
in uh in Florence caly and hanging out

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.919
in

00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:48.799
um a a very Catholic culture and um and

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:50.279
just sort

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:53.840
of observing like

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.080
origin the the origin story for

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.399
Catholicism

00:24:58.399 --> 00:25:02.120
is or for Christianity is that Jesus

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.399
died for our sins and I've never I've

00:25:05.399 --> 00:25:07.279
never understood what that meant I'm

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:12.880
sort of an Insider Outsider to um I was

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.279
raised in

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:18.279
a a Catholic Family but I was I was I

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:20.360
wasn't fully

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.559
enculturated and and so I've always felt

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:25.200
a bit like an Insider Outsider I mostly

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.240
feel like a Christian or I might clim

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:31.559
some aspect of Catholicism when I'm in a

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:34.000
completely different culture where I

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.200
have that that that reference from

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.720
outside but being here it's um what is

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.480
poignant for me is

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.600
observing the the Resonance of whatever

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.919
this story is it's had staying power for

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:55.919
over over 2,000 years and it's

00:25:55.919 --> 00:25:59.520
like how does that happen happen like

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.039
how how like it's just a complete

00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:06.720
mystery to me so like wondering as being

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.760
an inquiry around like okay An Origin

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.000
story of the universe or of life or

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
like

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.960
um H just

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.360
how how does a story like that gain any

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.520
kind of cultural resonance

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.840
that has any kind of momentum attached

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.440
to it is is I guess kind of

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.200
the the question that I'm that I'm

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.559
circling bless

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.720
you well I think that any origin story

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.679
that you can

00:26:50.679 --> 00:26:52.440
tell in

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.279
a

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:58.120
short way is going to sound equally

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.360
ridiculous right like at some point in

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.480
time people look at it and and say

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.600
that's

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.279
ridiculous um so again this notion of

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:08.200
being at the right historical moment at

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.240
the right time satisfying a need

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.720
for the certain thing those there's a

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.159
couple of people here and they're also

00:27:16.159 --> 00:27:19.279
in my Parallax course and we were just

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:20.919
talking about this it's fascinating

00:27:20.919 --> 00:27:22.480
because I have an ilot said you know

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.880
there was the Old

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.120
Testament where uh even the Old

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.360
Testament is weird because you know

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.559
there's God one two 3 four five days

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.320
then there's man and he rested but the

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.440
rest of the Old Testament is primarily a

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.840
story of the Hebrew people and he he

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.000
talks about that um and their

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.679
relationship to God and he says that um

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:50.000
very similar to gser he said

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.840
extraordinary thing happened because the

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.440
Hebrew people started to they were

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.360
tribal and they had a they had a

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.559
trial understanding of time so things

00:28:00.559 --> 00:28:02.159
just went around and around and around

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:04.080
and then they start to

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.640
see that time is historical and they

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.440
become very fascinated in

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.279
projecting the pro prophesizing the

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:16.360
future which brings in the Messianic

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.600
thing and then ill said so in

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.039
Catholicism

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:24.240
Christianity um history Stops With Jesus

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.000
it's finished there's nothing more you

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.320
can look look forward to there's nothing

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.840
more Pro there's no more progress Jesus

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.360
is the um has all the answers and

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.640
everything else is the perversion of The

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.240
Virtue which is Jesus Christ and in this

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.080
sense

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.480
that

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.760
um and then everything else you just

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.760
wait until the apocalypse right so

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.480
um this is an interesting way to see

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.720
circular time then there's origin and

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.200
then there's the end of History uh with

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.519
Christianity according to Ian ilich that

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:08.279
there's no more prophecies there's no

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:10.960
more prophets there's no me more

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.360
Messianic verver there's none of that

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.440
you just you're supposed to do what

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.720
Jesus

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.720
does that's the only you know that's

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.799
it's finished it's he's he completed

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:26.320
something

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.880
um

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.320
I don't know if that's why it has its

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.360
staying power

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.600
um elich would also argue that the the

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.159
European State the European nation state

00:29:40.159 --> 00:29:44.279
and hence all of Western culture um this

00:29:44.279 --> 00:29:47.919
was because Paul there was

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:50.880
Paul and there was the other guy can't

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.240
remember his

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.840
name the one that was struck down he was

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.320
killing Jews but then he was struck duck

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.679
down and um come on Peter uh no Peter

00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:07.039
Peter was the one that established the

00:30:07.039 --> 00:30:09.080
church right the rock Peter so there's

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:10.679
Peter and there was Paul and Paul wanted

00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:13.880
to continue the Gnostic kind of

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.880
dissemination of Christianity but Peter

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.760
had stayed back in Rome and learned

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.640
about the Holy Roman Empire and in the

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.360
hierarchy of roles and all of this and

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.200
for a long time Christianity and and the

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.559
state the Roman state were this were the

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:33.960
same thing and so it's so totally IM

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.679
mesed in everything we understand about

00:30:36.679 --> 00:30:39.240
the nation state and hierarchy and roles

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.480
and participation so I would say that

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.000
that's a big reason and of course in

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.559
Italy they have still have the

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:48.799
Roman uh you know they still have the

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:51.200
territory of Rome there so I would say

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.840
that's that's a that's a big deal it's

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.760
the same when you have these mon you

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.399
know these Arab states where where the

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:00.760
government and the state are so

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.360
closely together there's not not a lot

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.679
of deconstruction that can

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:19.799
happen

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:24.120
Jessica hi um I haven't been here for a

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.639
while um just because of busy things in

00:31:26.639 --> 00:31:29.320
life but I am back because I was doing

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.200
such a happy dance when I read your

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.360
pitch and it was like I just like oh my

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.840
God like when you're saying like what

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.519
are people starving for um and I I I had

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:40.240
to do my own book proposal a few months

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.720
ago and you have to answer that question

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.080
like why this book now and I'm like God

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.120
damn I wish that Bonnie had runs before

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.919
so I could have cribed all the things

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:49.880
that you were saying about like where we

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:55.679
are and what's needed um and and but I

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:58.159
know that this is coming into a question

00:31:58.159 --> 00:32:01.080
like I know that naming a thing and

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:03.440
doing a thing are sometimes like

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.559
antithetical to one to the other and

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:09.519
like when I try to share just in casual

00:32:09.519 --> 00:32:11.159
conversation with friends like some

00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:12.440
insight that we've had or something that

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.519
I've learned through my time like in the

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:18.159
popup school and with everyone here um

00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:20.159
it's hard to talk about like what popup

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:22.679
school is or what we're doing or and yet

00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:26.399
there's this real sort of like desire to

00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:29.720
share it and credited and and so I'm

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.000
just kind of wondering like what do

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.840
other people do what what like what do

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.000
you say are have has anyone given like

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.559
language to um like an easy way to kind

00:32:40.559 --> 00:32:43.480
of credit something back to the popup

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.960
School

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.799
process you know in my all those years I

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:56.000
taught the Master's course toward the

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.039
end we started ask adding a little when

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:00.080
people were writing their thesis we

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.960
started adding a

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.320
little module and the module was now

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.320
because we would meet for three three

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.840
days 10 hours on Friday 10 hours on

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.360
Saturday 10 hours on Sunday which was an

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.279
intense immersive it was that and so

00:33:15.279 --> 00:33:17.519
like this stuff for 30 hours right but

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:20.200
you're in together so there's like drama

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.240
and there's crying

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.279
and so but let's say the last quarter

00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:29.120
we'd meet and then I'd say okay now

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.080
spend 15 minutes talking to each other

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.679
when you go home you how are you going

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:35.159
to tell your

00:33:35.159 --> 00:33:38.600
husband what we did this weekend and it

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.120
was like everyone would laugh because

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.600
they didn't know how to talk about what

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.600
we were doing so um I don't know if

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.519
anybody else has

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:50.320
been sort

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.320
of

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.799
um more successful in that um but part

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:01.799
of the problem or part of the good thing

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:04.840
is you know we start by being very

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.919
rigorous and um that's hard to

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:09.599
encapsulate

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:12.000
so

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.440
um so part of developing a community is

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.720
the way language

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.399
becomes

00:34:19.399 --> 00:34:21.599
um it doesn't necessarily become

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.520
specialized because we have funny words

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.800
that are little words but the meaning

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.399
becomes specialized and precise and um

00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:33.040
that's so that's one thing and it's also

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.399
a reason why you know Jonathan Ron's

00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:37.119
been good good because he's been bugging

00:34:37.119 --> 00:34:39.040
me to write a book for like five years

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:44.560
now and he's persistent but not pushy um

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.800
but

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.399
um the book if it's successful should do

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:52.240
just that and then people that really

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240
know what it

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.440
means you know you have something well

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.920
this is you know you have like

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.200
something but obviously I'm not going to

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.640
go through and start

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.200
defining uh this is what uh Gaffney and

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.160
Stein are doing their book starts with

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.839
like definitions intimacy equals

00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:14.079
identity times I don't know times this

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:17.200
divided by that you know and I'm not

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.440
going to do that

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:25.040
so I don't know

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.400
um I think it gives you skills you know

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.680
that are transferable but to actually

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.160
talk about what we're doing is is even

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.520
when we're talking like talking about

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.480
the origin story this is kind of

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.760
ephemeral we don't even know what we're

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.720
talking about but even the the the

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.520
modules where we know exactly what we're

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.880
talking about like affect versus emotion

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.480
and dispositional state even those are

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.040
hard

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.040
to to

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.160
um just just talk about but I want to I

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.119
want to say something because I thought

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.800
it was really nice to see and that is

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.680
well I had this horse workshop and Aaron

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.319
was

00:36:07.319 --> 00:36:11.960
here and uh to help me but also you know

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.560
we we start I knew the group was going

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.319
to be like take forever to get organized

00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:18.520
in the morning so we were down there we

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.800
were doing some movement exercises and

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.520
at first uh what were we doing

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.079
um my brain is not so good so we were we

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:31.200
were we

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.520
were doing something but then he

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.800
realized that people were doing he he he

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.920
knew we were going to do the horse

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.240
workshop and he knew that people were

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.040
doing like these exercises to get their

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.880
bodies moving but they were closing

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.119
their eyes and they were going in and so

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:50.000
he he he then he modified it I don't

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.680
know if he had done this before and he

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.520
modified it now point to something and

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.200
go there and look at it and so basically

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.040
he created the here there posture

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.480
because when you work with the horses

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.800
you want to be listening to your body

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.119
but you want to be present and so that

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:10.079
was great because this is the way the

00:37:10.079 --> 00:37:12.079
work gets translated you know it didn't

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:14.119
say okay there are four posters and

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:16.280
there imposture you know blah blah blah

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:19.400
blah blah blah blah blah blah like I do

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.800
um and it was very effective and he and

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.839
he and we didn't even debrief afterwards

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:27.920
you know it was just

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.160
engaging in you know just implementing

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.640
whatever you find useful but yeah um

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.520
writing about it or rewriting about it

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.040
or

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.119
uh I F I understand that it's always

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:48.160
it's always it's always been the case

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.680
um then I told Katie when I saw my

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.680
animism film I hate watching myself on

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.240
video I'm like I talk like a child like

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.040
a baby and I'm saying these like like

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.119
really profound things and I why can't I

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:03.319
just put sentences together like Zack

00:38:03.319 --> 00:38:06.200
Stein or Daniel schanberg I'm like I

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.520
talk like a baby like what the I don't

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.520
even it's

00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:19.680
weird oh I don't know it all makes sense

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.160
uh but that was a good question and

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.480
explaining what we're doing here is

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:31.200
difficult uh but it's like my creation

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.400
story or my

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.560
narrative I think fits into what you're

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.800
doing at that bigger outer picture and

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.319
that's one reason I wanted to get into

00:38:40.319 --> 00:38:43.480
some of the physicality of it next year

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.760
but and that's it's like uh Justin when

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.319
he said you know came from a star well

00:38:48.319 --> 00:38:51.760
if it did happen to come from a big bang

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.680
you know we were all in that big bang

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.920
and then it all expanded out into all

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.280
that is was or ever will be but within

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.400
that big

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.680
bang um we were all connected so we were

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.760
all entangled at one time so that's part

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.560
of

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.720
the creation story let's say if that

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.079
what did didn't happen but anyway you're

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:14.200
in this Outer Circle along with the stoa

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.760
and P perspectiva and rebel

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.240
wisdom you know and we're down here

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.599
trying to figure out how we all fit into

00:39:23.599 --> 00:39:25.440
that that bigger Circle to solve the

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.520
problems of the world but that's where

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.040
I'm coming from and that's why I I want

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.240
to work within my narrative and

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.560
then we are the big picture somehow we

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.119
are the Outer Circle um yeah so so yeah

00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:43.960
we are the Outer Circle

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.480
um yeah so all of that is s the same

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.480
question you know we we move

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.319
around it's now it's reminding me of the

00:39:53.319 --> 00:39:56.079
Big Bang like there's the stoes body and

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:58.160
space and rebel wisdom is a body in

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.240
space and the p and all these these

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.920
these bodies are in orbit and the

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.400
question is what are they in orbit

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.119
around uh you know Cheryl Shu would say

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:11.119
a black

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:16.319
hole um and and that and

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:19.920
there's yeah what do they in orbit

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.200
around um so

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.119
um you know there're on orbit around

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:30.640
something exactly you see

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.319
that that's not a shirt that's his

00:40:34.319 --> 00:40:36.000
body

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.359
um there're they're an orbit around

00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:39.960
something that's there and not there at

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.440
the same time you know um so that goes

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.599
back to this notion of having a hit of

00:40:46.599 --> 00:40:49.280
there's something there uh but it's not

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.720
there at the same time it's there

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.000
because these things are

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.319
orbiting around each other or wob

00:40:56.319 --> 00:40:58.520
wobbling I would say more like wobbling

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.160
in orbit around each other

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.960
um one of the thoughts I've been having

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.480
as as this has been occurring this this

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.440
conversation

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.200
is about language like if I was a Bard

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.359
and I was to tell an origin story how

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:23.599
would I

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:26.599
begin um in the beginning doesn't seem

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:30.560
like a good beginning for some reason

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.280
so the classic beginning for a good

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.160
story is once upon a time once upon a

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.599
time seems like a much better beginning

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:40.599
because once upon a time has once inside

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:42.800
of a time once outside of a time once

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.240
when time was different than time is now

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:48.800
once right now once upon a

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.760
time there

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.319
was a Once Upon a Time Time became aware

00:41:54.319 --> 00:41:57.200
of itself and wondered what the is

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.160
this all about and that's kind of like

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.240
a a thing that generates

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.800
heat and that

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.359
heat is like an

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:12.000
enclosure and that

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.640
enclosure met other enclosures

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.800
and I don't know there there's something

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.960
about um what I'm trying to get at is

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.200
the Big Bang is something that happened

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.640
long ago versus the felt sense of like

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.000
what the is this

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.640
about that's the origin of something

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.680
that's the origin of like a thought

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.800
something is born in me some kind

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.480
of maybe that's the origin of everything

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.280
this kind of

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.520
huh what I'm trying to get at is like

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.599
the embodied feeling of of beginning

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:49.000
what does it actually feel like for

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
something to begin fresh and new in me

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.960
and maybe that's what it felt

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.880
like in the beginning of the beginning

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.559
once upon a

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.800
time that was fun to say no that was

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.599
great so a big part one big section is

00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:08.040
this notion of we're born in the

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.400
middle we weren't born when it started

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.240
we're not born when it's finished and

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.839
we're born in the middle and we asked

00:43:13.839 --> 00:43:17.880
these questions right and this already

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.880
conditions us plac us in contigent time

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.680
and space blah blah blah blah blah and

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.079
um is there a portal

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.640
yeah is there a portal

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.119
to um yeah is it a is yeah we're born in

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:38.119
the middle we're just born in the middle

00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:41.359
um in we're born in the middle of our

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:43.680
lifetime we're born in the middle of our

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:45.520
cultural lifespan we're born in the

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.720
middle of the planetary Journey we're

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.440
born in the middle of the cosmog genetic

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.960
uh and nobody's ever born at one end or

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.400
at the other end everything when you

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.520
look

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.000
at when you look at

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.880
the photograph of the known universe and

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.000
the it looks like a big eyeball and out

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.800
here is the big bang and the closer you

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.520
get you start to see you know plasma and

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.599
then you see electrons and galaxies and

00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:19.240
then you see heavy metals and then you

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.880
see planets area and then you see and

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.640
here you are in the middle everybody

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.720
it's like a it's not we think of it as a

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.640
sphere did I say this already here or

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.760
did I say this the other cour class this

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.559
is not good for my brain we think of it

00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:36.079
as a sphere and if a if you're inside of

00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:39.079
a of a balloon some people could be

00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:40.920
closer to the edge of the balloon than

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.240
other people but in the universe every

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:47.599
single perspective in the known universe

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:49.520
is still in the middle of the universe

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.760
so that's

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:56.760
weird and um so if you you think about

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.240
that that means time and space is

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.599
emanating from every individual

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:05.440
perspective which is the notion of the

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.800
Big Bang the singular perspective from

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.000
which everything always emanated from so

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.559
that's recreated that's what I would

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:15.079
call the pure abstraction called the

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:18.440
self that reality eminates from a

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.160
certain

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.480
perspective and that perspective gets

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.240
compounded of but not chopped up just

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.800
the same way in

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.680
amoeba the first amoeba is still here

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.920
but you know there's seven billion

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.040
amoeba and every amoeba is not one

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.160
billionth of the size of the first

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.680
amibas and get it it gets distributed

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.200
but not chopped up so that's one way to

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.119
think about it and um and if you again

00:45:49.119 --> 00:45:51.559
think of that picture and everything

00:45:51.559 --> 00:45:54.559
everything from this

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.040
perspective from every

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.280
perspective in every direction you can

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.400
see

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.720
is time and space emanating from the

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:07.240
present to the Past then I can say well

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.599
where's

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.960
tomorrow then that has to kind

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.680
of generate from its perspective A New

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.000
Perspective so we're we're always kind

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.200
of receding into tomorrow while more and

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.319
more of this so from a perspect

00:46:27.319 --> 00:46:30.319
uh and these These are popular popular

00:46:30.319 --> 00:46:32.599
uh origin stories this notion

00:46:32.599 --> 00:46:35.760
of you know singular perspectives that

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.720
are all at the center they're all

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.359
centers

00:46:41.359 --> 00:46:44.240
um that's that's in line with I think

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.839
some of the things Justin is saying uh

00:46:46.839 --> 00:46:50.319
or or ints it's not the same same thing

00:46:50.319 --> 00:46:55.480
but it has more of the interiority or

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.000
and the metaphysics of experience is

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.559
experience happens for someone that the

00:47:00.559 --> 00:47:02.920
central Nexus of

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.920
experience

00:47:07.599 --> 00:47:10.839
poly yeah I'm glad you mentioned um

00:47:10.839 --> 00:47:13.680
talking like or like a baby because um

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.720
this past week I've been sorry there's

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.160
an echo here

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:20.880
second that's better um so I've been

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.079
around this infant and just noticing how

00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:29.280
he's um engaged with the world and

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.800
um um that's great thank you

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.480
um yeah and so you know he he cries and

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.160
and and you know um the things that

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.480
soothe him are actually this sh like

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.599
this and you know I was just thinking

00:47:46.599 --> 00:47:48.359
this this little being has been so close

00:47:48.359 --> 00:47:50.240
to the source you know so what is what

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.559
is he seeing what is he remembering and

00:47:53.559 --> 00:47:55.520
and it kind of you know as that sh was

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.800
Happ and he was calming down and he he

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.760
really loves like the white the fan on

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.640
the oven um I was like oh my gosh is

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.920
that the origin story you know maybe

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.160
maybe the origin story isn't so much a

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.680
story but maybe it's a sound or and and

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.760
then I was thinking that

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.920
sh like what that does to my body and

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.599
then in nature that sound mimics you

00:48:18.599 --> 00:48:21.359
know wind blowing or the ocean moving

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.720
and now it's really beautiful if I hear

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:25.319
those sounds it's like that's the origin

00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:28.200
story calling calling me back so I was

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:29.520
just thinking about the origin story

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.319
being maybe a song or a sound

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.960
too well that's the M right uh that the

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.520
the origin is a vibration so you do

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.400
these these chants where you're not

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.160
actually singing You're vibrating your

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.400
body uh to experience um yeah that's

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.799
that's part of it Claudia you had your

00:48:51.799 --> 00:48:53.359
hand up a while ago did you want to say

00:48:53.359 --> 00:48:56.520
something uh yeah I'm not sure

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.920
um you just stopped me on is there a

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.799
tomorrow um you know and I don't think

00:49:01.799 --> 00:49:03.400
there is I don't think I don't think

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.200
there is a future you know in in time I

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.839
can never find

00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:11.319
it there's just the

00:49:11.319 --> 00:49:14.319
next breath right and the breath seems

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:17.319
right on the edge of absolutely

00:49:17.319 --> 00:49:19.280
nothing

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.079
um so edges come up for me when I think

00:49:22.079 --> 00:49:24.440
about Origins because it just seems kind

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.040
of weirdly prar

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:29.400
ious but then every time a miracle you

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.760
know that that the impulse comes and we

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:33.680
breathe

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.240
again so the origin just seems so

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:39.760
present in in you know like this this

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.920
kind of idea of generative you know that

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:45.760
we started a long time ago talking

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:49.240
about um I feel really like right on the

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.920
edge of something that's just endlessly

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.680
releasing but then I'm realizing this

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.760
isn't an origin story because a good

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.799
story right is isn't about necessarily

00:49:56.799 --> 00:50:00.000
yourself is it really it's

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.200
about sort of something

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.280
bigger that's

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.440
it

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.160
I love the pregnant pores but you

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.640
know yeah maybe that's it it's a

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.079
pregnant

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.440
pause

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.839
I think I brought this up oh can you

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:18.000
hear

00:51:18.119 --> 00:51:23.599
me I think I brought this up last time

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.559
um still I don't think I understand what

00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:28.680
we're going for

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.640
here

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:35.559
um but one thing that I think I think

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:40.880
of is like reality like that question we

00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:41.799
tried to

00:51:41.799 --> 00:51:44.559
answer a few days or weeks ago or

00:51:44.559 --> 00:51:48.400
whatever was like what is reality um I

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.599
don't know for me that's

00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:56.319
always something and maybe like

00:51:56.319 --> 00:51:58.480
the origin story is like sort of like

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.040
almost like for like answering that

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.720
question maybe it sort of

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:09.599
pops into an answer or something like

00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:11.599
that

00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:14.599
yeah

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.520
it

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.240
Kevin and

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:43.760
Steve sorry had to find my mouse on the

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.280
big screen

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.799
um yeah I have a bunch of notes written

00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:51.240
down this kind of like idea I've been

00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.359
working

00:52:52.359 --> 00:52:56.160
with um so who just just spoke with

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.880
Matthew just asked about like what is

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.280
reality and earlier someone was talking

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:04.200
about um simulations so like the mind

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.839
creates simulations you know that kind

00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:08.280
of evokes like computer

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.240
simulations um like maybe a simulation

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.200
of the Big Bang or

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.079
like um but what is a simulation it's

00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:20.720
like if you think of Conway's Game of

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.040
Life that's kind of a really simple

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.359
simulation you have like your original

00:53:25.359 --> 00:53:28.160
like starting condition you have your

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.720
origin right and then you have like the

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.680
rules of evolution so like conways game

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:36.760
of life it kind of progresses you know

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.079
based on

00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:42.760
rules and um these origin stories you

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.760
know they're always embedded in the

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.839
context and I've been I've been flirting

00:53:45.839 --> 00:53:49.960
with this idea of like uh An Origin

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.720
story that involves or maybe not it's

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.200
not really an origin story but like

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:58.480
working with real reality shows so like

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.079
like you got Survivor you know the

00:54:00.079 --> 00:54:02.520
bachelor like whatever and think about

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.000
it they all have like an an origin story

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.960
so like when um who was it uh when I

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.599
forget your name when you brought up the

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:14.440
idea like in the beginning or once upon

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:16.559
a time like I immediately went and I

00:54:16.559 --> 00:54:18.520
looked up like the tagline for the MTV

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.960
show the real world and it's like this

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.480
is the true story of seven strangers

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.160
picked to live in a house and have their

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.160
lives taped to find out what happens

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.520
when people stop being polite and start

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.720
getting real like that sounds like a

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:35.559
Greek myth to me like and like so think

00:54:35.559 --> 00:54:37.079
about like what a reality show is it's

00:54:37.079 --> 00:54:40.319
essentially so think about like um the

00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:42.160
physics the Big Bang that's kind of like

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:45.480
built on the discoveries of like

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.160
physical science but then there's like

00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.240
physical science experiments physics

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.680
then there's also social science and

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.599
like each social science experiment is

00:54:52.599 --> 00:54:53.839
kind of like a simulation of human

00:54:53.839 --> 00:54:55.960
behavior where they're setting up like

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.680
initial conditions based on some

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.680
Assumption of like The Human Experience

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.960
and that's what reality shows do too

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.480
they're like setting up these initial

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.359
constraints based on these assumptions

00:55:05.359 --> 00:55:06.720
and they all kind of tell a story it's

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.839
like how do people compete

00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:14.040
survive uh find love work together you

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.720
know they're kind of like working with

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.160
these conditions and and I what I what I

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.400
like about that um my last part of this

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.359
is like it's the the phrase itself

00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:25.119
reality show is so funny because it

00:55:25.119 --> 00:55:26.920
almost contains a cont contradiction

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.640
where it's like it's reality but it's a

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.000
show it's reality but it's but it's a

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.599
show and like that's kind of like what

00:55:34.599 --> 00:55:35.799
language feels like sometimes it's like

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.079
it's pointing to reality but it's also

00:55:37.079 --> 00:55:38.400
like it's a show it's like a simulation

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.240
it's not real so that's that's my take

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.599
thanks for

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:56.680
listening Steve

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.880
thanks yeah I might follow on a little

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.760
bit from both Claudia and Kevin there um

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.079
maybe different kind of ways but I've

00:56:04.079 --> 00:56:05.440
got a kind of meta question which is I'm

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.000
kind of thinking about the origins at

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.280
all if you know what I mean like like

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.720
why do we need Origins at all why do we

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.599
need alphas and omegas um and it feels a

00:56:14.599 --> 00:56:16.559
little bit like in terms of the reality

00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:19.920
show um it's almost like you're framing

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.960
almost like a a go of life rather than

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.599
the life you're living it's almost like

00:56:24.599 --> 00:56:26.240
when you start talking about alphas and

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.520
omegas it's almost like you're talking

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:29.760
about this paral parallel life to the

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.760
one you're actually living which is this

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.400
kind of um imagined show of life if you

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.359
know what I mean rather than the flow of

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:39.240
rather than the flow of life and that

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.319
the flow of life doesn't really need

00:56:41.319 --> 00:56:44.520
alphas and omegas it you know it's we've

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.280
never experienced Alpha and Omega really

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.079
other than you know we were not even

00:56:48.079 --> 00:56:50.160
conscious of our own birth we won't

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.720
necessarily be that conscious of Our Own

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.079
Death so it you know our lives aren't

00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:57.160
really made up about and omegas and so I

00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.440
kind of want and I also wonder why I

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.200
know lots of people like I know um gram

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.079
gr Brendon Dempsey is is trying to

00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:06.039
create this new Alpha Omega myth and

00:57:06.039 --> 00:57:07.119
things like that and I just feel

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:09.520
everyone's barking up their own because

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:11.599
I think maybe the problem is that

00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.839
framing I think maybe that's you know

00:57:13.839 --> 00:57:15.960
and it's like um also with the utopic

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.039
thinking that then just becomes a kind

00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:21.119
of con constant deferral into the future

00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:23.200
when really you want Utopia now you know

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.760
you want you want you want right now so

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:28.640
yeah so I've got a problem at a meta

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.200
level with just the overall framing of

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:32.559
Alpha and

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.359
Omega okay so this is very good because

00:57:36.359 --> 00:57:41.039
I was I was I was I

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.160
was

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.920
um got a problem with language

00:57:49.559 --> 00:57:52.599
BL um where'd you go where's Steve on my

00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:55.000
screen did he drop out oh there he is

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.839
okay because when you raise your hand

00:57:56.839 --> 00:58:00.400
you're up there and then and okay so

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.200
what's happening here like one of the

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:05.240
things I did talk about like in the book

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.760
is the origin story will frame it with

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.799
like all these epistemic constraints a

00:58:09.799 --> 00:58:11.480
big one is just time why should

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:15.680
something have a beginning like and that

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.960
as modern or uh so I'm going to start

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.559
with that this notion is your first uh

00:58:23.559 --> 00:58:26.000
see that we don't have origin story that

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.319
seems weird blah blah blah blah um the

00:58:29.319 --> 00:58:31.359
book is called The Once and Future God

00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:33.839
so it places it in a temporal uh

00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:37.400
framework because but then the first

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:41.480
part is just to highlight because it's a

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.200
metaphysics of experience so I'm

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.280
highlighting the experience of coming to

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.119
terms with an origin story but I also

00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:49.839
have this list I'm not going to do it

00:58:49.839 --> 00:58:51.200
this

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:55.640
formally but um there's this book that I

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.400
wrote I that the review of which won the

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:01.640
astral codex 10 book review award it's

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:04.559
called the educated mind I have the book

00:59:04.559 --> 00:59:07.240
he just basically takes Merlin Donald's

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:08.839
work which I taught for years in the

00:59:08.839 --> 00:59:10.480
Master's course and applies it to

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:14.119
education but you could he says that uh

00:59:14.119 --> 00:59:16.839
throughout history we've developed these

00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:19.880
different skills of how we learn and

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.319
that the child goes through these phases

00:59:22.319 --> 00:59:24.839
which recapitulates it so first there

00:59:24.839 --> 00:59:29.720
somatic or mimetic that we just uh um so

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:31.720
this is kind of like if you it's like if

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:34.160
you're telling an origin story it's kind

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.960
of like why do you cook you know why do

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.640
you cook hamburgers that way because my

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:40.880
mother always did you know like it goes

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.119
it's just a mimic story and then there's

00:59:43.119 --> 00:59:44.160
the

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.559
Mythic story which um you have to be

00:59:47.559 --> 00:59:51.720
clever because some of these uh some of

00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:55.680
these mythic stories seem sound their

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.039
signifiers sound theoretic but they're

00:59:58.039 --> 01:00:00.760
actually Mythic um and then you get the

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.400
Romantic stories which are narrative and

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:08.599
these are more like um gossip right like

01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:11.960
gossipy stories um and then you get the

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.720
philosophic and theoretic and then you

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.520
get the what you just proposed was the

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.839
ironic or The Meta aware you go and you

01:00:17.839 --> 01:00:20.480
say wow there's epic constraints why are

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.359
we doing this at all um so you can see

01:00:24.359 --> 01:00:26.319
people will track you know touching base

01:00:26.319 --> 01:00:28.680
in these different portals but then it's

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.880
not in the book but I am going to

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.280
propose that there's a six uh that

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.599
there's a

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:41.839
six um way that you can see uh becoming

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:43.799
to that you can see in places which is

01:00:43.799 --> 01:00:48.720
what Jan zi calls the lyric so it's a

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.200
wear it's a wear like the ironic but it

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.440
overcomes the limitations of just

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:59.039
um it's like you're aware of the magic

01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:01.240
trick but you still want to believe in

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.039
the magic whereas the ironic you can't

01:01:03.039 --> 01:01:05.400
enjoy the magic trick right because it

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.119
knows how it's done there's there's a

01:01:08.119 --> 01:01:13.079
move there um that is

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:16.880
completely aware

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.920
that putting things in temporal temporal

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.880
framework is already a bogus thing or

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.799
creating a narative Arc is already a

01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:27.960
bogus thing all these things are already

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.400
bogus and yet so that that's that's

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.720
uh something I that's go ahead yeah is

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.720
that close to ironic sincerity because

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.240
that's that's that's a thing that you

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.119
coming up in the metamod which I really

01:01:41.119 --> 01:01:43.359
like it to be almost like the best idea

01:01:43.359 --> 01:01:46.039
in the whole thing really I would say

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:48.240
it's that ironic sincerity is still a

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.039
little too ironic but the sincerity

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:53.160
obviously sounds like it's moving in the

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:56.520
other way um one of the things that the

01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:01.880
lyric does is it it moves it says at

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.760
scale these big big

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.119
questions they only it only deserves

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:12.520
irony but I can look at the particular

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.200
how the tree what's the origin of the

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.279
tree what's the origin of my breath

01:02:16.279 --> 01:02:19.599
what's the origin of this and somehow

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:22.440
those hang together it's a family of

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.440
things that hang together and I may

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.400
never be able to articulate then what

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.799
origin is but I've become closer to An

01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:32.680
Origin story inside myself so so I don't

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.319
think that's the move the ironists make

01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:35.680
because they're too they're too meta

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.920
aware and even if they get sincere you

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.720
have someone like Brendan Graham Dempsey

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.079
who just tries to think bigger um

01:02:43.079 --> 01:02:46.000
whereas the lyric move is is like the

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.319
Blake the poet what's his name William

01:02:49.319 --> 01:02:52.480
Blake and if I if I look at all these

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.960
particulars somehow I see there's

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.839
something about them her her phrase is

01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:00.440
they're like families they hang

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.720
together and I walk away feeling

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.920
that I've grounded in An Origin story or

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.480
An Origin understanding of origin and

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:14.240
yet if I then go and try to articulate

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:16.680
it I come I bump up against these

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.920
epistemic constraints so I'm going to

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.720
start with the epistemic constraints

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.599
because because this is the audience to

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:27.480
the metamodern you know and they're

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.319
that's exactly what they're gonna like

01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:32.119
why is she even trying to tell an origin

01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:35.359
story right and and also because the

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.920
book is trying to be grounded in the

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.279
metaphysics of experience so while I'm

01:03:39.279 --> 01:03:40.839
doing this I'm wondering okay let me

01:03:40.839 --> 01:03:43.640
tell you my experience of doing this so

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.720
uh uh yeah that that I think right now

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.279
when I look at my outline that's the

01:03:50.279 --> 01:03:51.920
first that's the first thing it said

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.880
epistemic constraints and

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.839
um then it might follow a little bit of

01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:01.279
that somatic Mythic but I'm not going to

01:04:01.279 --> 01:04:02.680
sit there and label them because it's

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.559
kind of bogus in a way but kind of weave

01:04:05.559 --> 01:04:08.359
in these different perspectives and then

01:04:08.359 --> 01:04:11.119
um yeah and then

01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:13.799
uh yeah so something so something like

01:04:13.799 --> 01:04:16.880
that will happen so so it's not like

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.839
telling an origin

01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:22.559
story I'm just going to come up with one

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:26.200
but um

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.319
yeah that's exactly the territory that

01:04:29.319 --> 01:04:31.839
needs to be

01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:35.720
explicated and then

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.799
um

01:04:37.799 --> 01:04:40.359
yeah because you can't even write a book

01:04:40.359 --> 01:04:42.039
like Wilbur did anymore you can't sit

01:04:42.039 --> 01:04:43.760
down and write up for even people be

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.799
like that's just it's just a myth you

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:50.000
know I mean you you those days I mean

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.640
things have changed in the space really

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.039
quickly um

01:04:56.039 --> 01:04:58.119
whereas when Wilbur wrote it was like Ah

01:04:58.119 --> 01:05:00.279
that's a myth I can believe you know

01:05:00.279 --> 01:05:03.319
it's like okay one quick follow on

01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:04.640
question if I may but just about on the

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:06.960
sincerity side so because you there's a

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:09.400
regress into Infinity on the ironic side

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.279
but then I think there's an Infinity on

01:05:11.279 --> 01:05:12.960
the serious side it's kind of fractal on

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.920
the serious side so infinite detail and

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.520
infinite richness oh there okay yeah

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.119
yeah you know what I mean so I think

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:21.400
there's a kind of I don't know that I

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.559
don't know it's a problem but it's an

01:05:22.559 --> 01:05:24.960
observation at least no no if if it's in

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.319
toward the particular um then then it's

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:30.279
similar to Lyric I haven't really

01:05:30.279 --> 01:05:33.680
noticed that um I've noticed that people

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.119
are ironic but then they're like but

01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:37.760
take me seriously but I haven't seen

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.680
them

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.279
really um but yeah if that's what the

01:05:42.279 --> 01:05:44.640
serious on seriously ironic is it's

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.880
moving it's definitely in that direction

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.880
where but the lyric is not ironic at all

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.520
it's the opposite it's it's if anything

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.720
can come across as being like

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.480
to Google eyed or

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.760
something if you're ironic it'll look

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.880
very Google

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.720
eyed

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.440
Jessica maybe this is like too basic but

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.119
like to the question of like why do we

01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:13.520
need an origin story I feel like you

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.880
know from maybe like a ritual

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.440
perspective like when you're shifting

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.240
identities and moving from one place to

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.680
another it's so helpful and useful to be

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.920
able to say I was here now I'm here and

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.839
to like make the move and so I think

01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:30.000
that's why people write so many Memoir

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.319
traumatic experiences like that that

01:06:31.319 --> 01:06:33.279
sort of thing and so I feel like the

01:06:33.279 --> 01:06:37.279
doing this you know like like I just can

01:06:37.279 --> 01:06:39.880
really see how it serves to bring people

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.520
along like to just agree on you know

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.680
there was we were here and now we're

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.359
going somewhere else or like leaving

01:06:46.359 --> 01:06:47.839
that old way

01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:50.720
behind yeah and that that appeals to

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.880
Something in the pitch it says you know

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.000
uh

01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:59.359
uh that you know one must feel whole one

01:06:59.359 --> 01:07:00.920
must feel that the self is not in split

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.119
into Parts one must feel you know that's

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:05.240
part of the identity that you know

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.240
people in nature are one continous whole

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.720
um

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.359
so you can feel that uh but then if

01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:15.640
you're kind

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.559
of bopping around in origin story that

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:21.799
what I call epistemic leakage that kind

01:07:21.799 --> 01:07:25.960
of makes you feel fragmented um I I find

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.799
the Stacked levels uh uh model that in

01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:33.880
emergence you know so you have animal

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.279
you know you have matter and then you

01:07:35.279 --> 01:07:39.000
have life emerges and then I I find uh I

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.079
told Greg Enrique this trying to help

01:07:41.079 --> 01:07:45.520
them fix it um that on the one hand it

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.359
does look like it's arguing for

01:07:47.359 --> 01:07:49.559
continuity but it leaks out that there

01:07:49.559 --> 01:07:50.680
are

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.839
gaps and and and and and and reality is

01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:58.559
chopped up by these gaps and

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:03.160
so can we get closer to An Origin story

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.480
that makes us feel whole uh with

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.799
ourselves with our family with the with

01:08:09.799 --> 01:08:12.880
the biosphere with the COS Cosmos you

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.400
know and

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:22.839
um that's an

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.520
interesting that that's very basic and I

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.600
would agree with that but I put

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.040
something in the chat and I tell you

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.759
this is weird so I wrote five appreciate

01:08:32.759 --> 01:08:35.000
the mysterious origins of the cosmos and

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.600
the irreducibility of the other I don't

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.080
know why I don't I mean I was just in

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.440
this flow when I wrote the pitch deck

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.319
and there's a clue in there for me this

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:50.199
happens a lot why is the origin story

01:08:50.199 --> 01:08:51.960
what does the origin story have to do

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.799
with the irreducibility of the other

01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:57.960
that to me answers the question and I

01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:59.719
don't know what I don't even know why I

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:01.679
wrote that it doesn't even seem to fit

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.440
when I read it back right when I was

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.279
writing the post again I'm like what

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.600
what what the does that mean what

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.359
are those why are those two things on

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:13.080
the same line and so this is like a a

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:18.520
Coen that is in there for me um I think

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.279
and

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:23.319
um I didn't notice it until I wrote that

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:26.040
in the post again

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.239
uh what why is that why is that there

01:09:29.239 --> 01:09:31.679
it's an

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:35.040
interesting the mysterious origins of

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.000
the cosmos and the irreducibility of the

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.679
other

01:09:40.679 --> 01:09:44.319
h i I loved it Bonnie because you you it

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:47.080
sort of was posted just after I was kind

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.000
of thinking about my own origin story

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.480
and then trying to put it in the bigger

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.600
thing which I could which was

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.000
irreducible which I couldn't do so it

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.239
felt it really fit with what I just said

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:59.679
which is why I gave it the thumbs up um

01:09:59.679 --> 01:10:01.159
but there there

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:04.679
was um the the kind of origin stories

01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:09.320
you see in communities are often

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.080
um it's sort of that we're we're we're

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.880
following the wrong story like you know

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.679
we're the Lost Children of Gia for

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:18.960
example you see that um as a kind of

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.120
story of who we are in kind of

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.520
place-based sort of Ventures because the

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.199
solution is to realize we're actually

01:10:26.199 --> 01:10:29.239
not lost and you can become found or

01:10:29.239 --> 01:10:33.600
whatever um by finding your belonging in

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.560
in in in in in a story of place so that

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.159
kind of thing really works for the kinds

01:10:39.159 --> 01:10:42.640
of Minds who are interested in

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.320
regenerative agriculture for example you

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.320
know that we're we're lost but actually

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.520
we're not um and if you connect with

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.400
your river system or your catchment then

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.120
you're you're you're found and you then

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.960
have a story of belonging and your

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.400
origin story is about that catchment Etc

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.000
so that kind of is a story that fits for

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.480
a particular audience and I think is

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.159
kind of quite powerful for a lot of

01:11:07.159 --> 01:11:11.239
people trying to do that kind of work um

01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:12.440
so I just thought I'd say that and then

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.080
the other thing is in terms of sort of

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.840
describing the work that you do um I

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.159
find

01:11:18.159 --> 01:11:20.520
that when I talk about we're trying to

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:23.199
articulate a theory of the body and then

01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:24.159
I

01:11:24.159 --> 01:11:26.159
sort of talk about how the body is and

01:11:26.159 --> 01:11:29.159
you know we've we've opened the range of

01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:32.360
what the word body means

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.600
um that sort of it's not a story right

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.440
but it that communicates that

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.600
communicates it maybe I don't know maybe

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.920
Minds like the idea that there's a kind

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.440
of rigor to it I don't know but because

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.679
also for me I often sort of follow it

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:50.760
into a conversation around education so

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.320
that if we understand the human better

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.800
then we can educate better you know if

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.520
because

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.760
um that seems to fit into a lot of

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.280
conversations you know this this idea

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.120
that we we don't understand who the who

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.800
the human is um if we could understand

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.800
who the human is or the body is if we

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.239
had a better theory of that then we

01:12:11.239 --> 01:12:15.800
could do better um so

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.080
yeah yeah so this touches okay Kimberly

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.480
go ahead first this

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.080
is

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.239
thanks I I was gonna just

01:12:27.239 --> 01:12:31.480
um move along with the irreducibility of

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.120
the other as

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.600
um a way

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:41.560
of relating to other

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.679
bodies and um I'm by the way I'm really

01:12:46.679 --> 01:12:51.400
loving hearing the weaving process of

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.960
everyone's attempts

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:57.960
to put this in to words um and the

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:04.520
invitations to bring it into story and

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.080
song um I was really appreciative of

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:14.040
what Holly said um in terms of looking

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.639
at the development of an infant and even

01:13:17.639 --> 01:13:18.880
understanding

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:21.560
that the

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:24.480
infant is situated in

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.719
relationship the fetus is in

01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:30.000
relationship so the

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.760
sh

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.719
sound

01:13:33.719 --> 01:13:37.520
is soothing because it also

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.080
mirrors the digestive

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.320
system and the circulatory system of the

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.960
mother so the

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:51.199
sounds are part of the environment of

01:13:51.199 --> 01:13:53.800
the fetus and when they trans transition

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.400
into a different environment the cold

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.840
one the one that is shocking to their

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:06.760
system um it's an establishment of

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.600
new actions and relatedness and this is

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.800
what they

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:18.520
are built what we are built for um

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.400
and it's incredible the capacity to

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:24.840
connect

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.159
with a new world a new

01:14:28.159 --> 01:14:33.320
space um and so I had this image of I I

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.080
think I think um Claudia said something

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.440
about bringing it back just to the

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.120
Simplicity of

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:45.760
breath and um and I was reminded once

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.480
again that that is also that is to a

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.520
relationship the breath itself is a

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.000
relationship between self an

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.480
environment we're taking in the cosmos

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.280
we're taking in the sky we're taking in

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.360
all of the nutrients

01:15:04.679 --> 01:15:07.679
um

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:14.159
and so self in relation to space and

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:17.560
environment self in relation

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.280
to other that

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.520
is irreducibly

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:28.159
um like that like I

01:15:28.159 --> 01:15:30.280
cannot

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.440
um fully grasp the other like there's a

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.440
there's a

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.440
respect um for the body of other in this

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.040
work that I really appreciate um and

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.560
then the last thing that's coming up for

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.639
me I hope this is making sense as I'm

01:15:46.639 --> 01:15:48.040
flowing with

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:54.480
it um is the relationship between

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.800
time and

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.520
change and how as

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:02.560
we are in whatever the environment is

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.120
the environment itself is

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.120
changing um and that is one of the

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.679
tracking and we are changing within the

01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:11.560
environment and as one of the ways time

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:13.920
is actually measured you can see it

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.480
really clearly when you have like

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.280
puppy it's like I can't believe it six

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.120
months already

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.960
um

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.920
so those were those were my kind of

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.280
threads that I'm bringing together um

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.800
self and environment relationship with

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.199
time and change and that inner being

01:16:36.199 --> 01:16:41.320
of um other

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.520
bodies yeah that was perfect I'm gonna

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:47.280
go meta on it a little because I'm gonna

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.080
I'm kind of talking to Steve but um so

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.760
that's what I would call metaphysics of

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.199
experience exp erience like you say

01:16:54.199 --> 01:16:56.480
you're having this experience and you're

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.639
you're being quite naive about it and

01:16:58.639 --> 01:17:00.360
then you realize that something in this

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.040
experience right

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.800
now um so the baby like sh because

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.400
that's in the wound and the wound is

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.679
from the other and so you can trace back

01:17:08.679 --> 01:17:09.880
to

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.560
origin from the present like from the

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:15.520
experience you're having now um instead

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.679
of having a metaphysics and then trying

01:17:18.679 --> 01:17:21.719
to understand experience of it so it's

01:17:21.719 --> 01:17:24.080
it's in a different direction

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:27.280
and um

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:30.080
and and so that was lovely it was lovely

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.199
like this is the kind of uh confidence

01:17:34.199 --> 01:17:36.840
that working from this direction is

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.480
because

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.320
you you know you don't have to be a

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.320
Galaxy brain you know you just have to

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.880
be curious like why

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.639
does why does you know why why all these

01:17:48.639 --> 01:17:50.840
little like a kid like there's so much

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.159
curious and mysteriousness and you you

01:17:53.159 --> 01:17:55.760
know that somehow it ties all the way

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.080
back you just know now you as you're

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.840
tying it all the way back you can get

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.040
into

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.040
like gobbledygook and whoopity woo and

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.159
start telling you can feel yourself

01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:08.480
becoming too Mythic and it gets cool and

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.719
stuff but you know

01:18:11.719 --> 01:18:13.760
that that there's something you can

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.320
trace there's a traceability that way

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.400
you know that that must be the fabric of

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.280
the universe now having said that so

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.760
that's exactly what I mean by

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.760
metaphysics of experience um now having

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.040
said that and it doesn't feel like you

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.199
can tell so we this is one of the

01:18:32.199 --> 01:18:34.080
reasons why we did the work that we did

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.120
you can tell when it's just more feels

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:39.040
more like observation and what we call

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.480
cross modal leaps right we're making

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.480
well the breath must be like something

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.520
that happened to the ear in the early

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.480
Universe it's a cross modal leap versus

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:50.600
when it gets to be extremely imaginary

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.080
and projection so we're always kind of

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.120
like on that edge um but we know there's

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.360
different biomarkers

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.440
for what you know what that that

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.480
experience is we're not always able to

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.400
especially if you're in some kind of

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.639
limal space and stuff is downloading

01:19:08.639 --> 01:19:10.600
really fast you're not always able to

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.639
know which is which but um so the

01:19:15.639 --> 01:19:19.560
alternative which um is there so then

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.600
there's this another trap in uh telling

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:28.120
origin stories and that is um this

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.639
notion of whether the universe has first

01:19:31.639 --> 01:19:34.239
principles and first values right is is

01:19:34.239 --> 01:19:35.639
the

01:19:35.639 --> 01:19:39.400
universe a loving place you know this is

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.880
what Einstein said you know the

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.400
difference it's important the biggest

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.400
thing in a person's life is whether you

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.600
think the universe is a friendly place

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.880
or not this very

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.400
important but um one of the problems

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.199
with positing

01:19:56.199 --> 01:20:00.719
metaphysical values is that if you say

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:05.000
the universe is a loving place um if you

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.360
say God is all knowing and all powerful

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.679
and all loving you have to a you have to

01:20:11.679 --> 01:20:15.239
ask well why do does he let babies die

01:20:15.239 --> 01:20:19.199
in burning cars and um then you get into

01:20:19.199 --> 01:20:23.360
all these these um

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.960
mental gymnastics by saying well then

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.360
there's pseudo Arrow or there's pseudo

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.480
love or there's pseudo this or there's

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:33.480
and the question

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:37.560
is one of the questions is whether or

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:42.320
not there is a gradient so in in Brendan

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.719
gr Dempsey's work and in Greg's work the

01:20:44.719 --> 01:20:48.440
gradi gradient always toward higher

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.920
complexity um and this you know being me

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.600
I

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.040
reject but is there a gradient and and I

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.199
just in my work I just call it

01:20:59.199 --> 01:21:03.639
aprension it's a gradient that things

01:21:03.639 --> 01:21:07.800
overall are more likely to do this and

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.000
less likely to that do that but at a

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.560
local level that array the gradient

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:18.960
array can be different right so um um

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.280
it's in the in the northern hemisphere

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.880
it's more likely to rises in the East

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880
and settles in the West in the southern

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:28.520
hemisphere it's different but behind

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:31.000
that is still the protention for the sun

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.840
to rise and fall or something like that

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:35.320
this great so is there a

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.000
gradient

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.760
established at the beginning of the

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.719
universe or just is there a gradient in

01:21:42.719 --> 01:21:43.520
the

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:47.080
universe and I'm going to make a

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.719
case uh or if I I'm going to try to make

01:21:49.719 --> 01:21:51.360
a case and if I can't pull it off then

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.840
I'll just have to drop drop that

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.600
but um my

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:03.440
story um I'll tell after uh Justin makes

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.679
a

01:22:06.199 --> 01:22:08.239
comment well it occurred to me that I

01:22:08.239 --> 01:22:09.719
have an

01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:11.920
incipient origin

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.760
story you know I have this daily prama

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.880
practice and I often jot down

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:20.080
notes and another thing is that I have

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.520
these little thoughts that come to me

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.239
and sometimes over time they start

01:22:23.239 --> 01:22:25.679
weaving themselves together so I'm

01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:27.800
noticing a beginning of a weaving so I'm

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.000
just going to whether it makes any sense

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.679
or not I'm going to share it so what I

01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:33.199
wrote down I think it was the day before

01:22:33.199 --> 01:22:36.880
yesterday was the I am in each person is

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.159
the eye of a black hole taking in but

01:22:40.159 --> 01:22:43.560
unperturbed by the dancing Joy outside

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:45.320
of its

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.639
interior and many times over the years

01:22:49.639 --> 01:22:51.880
Joy is in the many keeps returning to me

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.679
all the time and it does match up a

01:22:53.679 --> 01:22:56.960
little bit with Ora bendo's she leapt

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.320
forth from him in a burst of joy to play

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.239
it finding him again in time so if you

01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:03.520
look at if the

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.239
singularity is the actual I'm gonna

01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:08.159
assume it's true because I don't know

01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:10.320
big big bang There was a singularity and

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.080
the joy burst forth from it then at the

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:15.760
center of each Galaxy the the many is

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.639
returning to this to a singularity and

01:23:18.639 --> 01:23:21.480
so the joy is joying in the

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.679
recombination into the

01:23:23.679 --> 01:23:26.159
interior of a singularity and that

01:23:26.159 --> 01:23:28.540
there's a singularity inside of each

01:23:28.540 --> 01:23:29.719
[Music]

01:23:29.719 --> 01:23:33.199
person that's okay so this is exactly

01:23:33.199 --> 01:23:36.280
what I'm gonna argue in different

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:41.880
terms and um so I'm going to argue that

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:44.239
the initial

01:23:44.239 --> 01:23:47.040
whatever was The Ultimate Compound

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.719
individual I'm I'm going to use um wh

01:23:50.719 --> 01:23:52.159
head terms internal and external

01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:53.320
relation

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.480
the initial whatever was just internally

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.159
related to itself a black hole only has

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:02.080
internal relations it's just internally

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.520
related to itself which doesn't mean

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.560
there can't be some kind of

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:11.840
differentiation but there's no exterior

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.000
relationships and then

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.719
somehow

01:24:15.719 --> 01:24:19.800
this opens up or or something happens uh

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.000
so it itself is a singularity and now

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.639
what you have is the ability to have

01:24:25.639 --> 01:24:28.920
external relations but in every external

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.560
relationship there's a little bit of the

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.480
person I'm relating to exteriorly that's

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.080
compounded into

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:40.639
me so so now you have two dances first

01:24:40.639 --> 01:24:43.320
you had one hand clamp and so I said

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:45.679
this the other day it's like the typical

01:24:45.679 --> 01:24:47.639
thing is the yin and the Yang but when

01:24:47.639 --> 01:24:49.400
it comes out the white has a little

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.040
black dot in it and the black has a

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.360
little white like Dot and it because

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.280
those are the internal relations

01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.679
of each others so so the black hole is

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.560
just internal relations and then the The

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.440
Joy or the expressive Universe the

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.360
explicit universe is this ability to

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.880
have external relationships and it's got

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.400
you know it's it's and and so this is

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.639
like uh the absence of Gap Junctions

01:25:18.639 --> 01:25:20.920
right so you have individual

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.199
identities um and um all the things that

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:30.119
happen externally and that the gradient

01:25:30.119 --> 01:25:35.159
the gradient array is toward the

01:25:35.159 --> 01:25:38.320
complexification of in external

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.480
relationships and the compounding of

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:44.239
internal relationships so that

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.840
eventually so if you look at the

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.560
interior of a modern high school kid

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.280
there's a lot more going on in there

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.199
their interior a lot more of the culture

01:25:56.199 --> 01:26:00.320
and there's they're more okay so there's

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.080
two ways there's a physical way to be a

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.159
compound individual so here's me I'm a

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.800
compound

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.400
individual um I'm made up of me many

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.960
cells they share one identity and so

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:15.239
there's that but then I'm in a

01:26:15.239 --> 01:26:17.760
collective called the culture and I'm

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.080
becoming more

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.719
compounded that way and I don't believe

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:25.840
there's a compound individual yet called

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.119
the social Collective but I believe

01:26:28.119 --> 01:26:29.719
these two things are happening at the

01:26:29.719 --> 01:26:32.440
same time and I think

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.280
somehow there's a gradient between them

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.159
like I'm not sure what it is yet but

01:26:37.159 --> 01:26:41.800
this I think is what the gradient is and

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.440
um so it's the same story that you're

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:46.600
saying but I'm using a process

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:51.199
philosophy terms to to talk about it um

01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:54.199
and

01:26:56.119 --> 01:26:58.520
so

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.400
like there's there's a bacteria that

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.960
lives in a sheep's gut and it can't

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.400
doesn't live anywhere

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.320
else and

01:27:11.639 --> 01:27:17.880
um it and it it required the Sheep to to

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.520
to grow evolve the Sheep had to evolve a

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.760
a bladder lives in this bladder before

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:26.119
this bacteria could mutate to live in it

01:27:26.119 --> 01:27:30.400
right and so um this relationship

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.199
between that's a bad example but but I

01:27:33.199 --> 01:27:37.560
think that this is this is these are the

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:41.960
epistemic tools I'm going to use to talk

01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:44.960
about um what what's going on and so why

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.239
is it important

01:27:47.239 --> 01:27:50.239
because

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:55.440
um we need on a practical level to be

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.040
able

01:27:57.040 --> 01:28:01.199
to oh I figured it out now that what in

01:28:01.199 --> 01:28:03.320
in a collective there's the

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.880
irreducibility of the other in a

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.040
compound individual it's a singularity

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:12.159
right and we need to know the difference

01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:15.800
between them we need a

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.080
rigorous we I mean I think we have

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.639
instincts but we don't know what we're

01:28:19.639 --> 01:28:20.800
talking

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.040
about um

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.800
something like that I mean I find it

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.400
very similar to you're what you're

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.159
talking about visually and in in in

01:28:31.159 --> 01:28:33.360
terms

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.280
of the black hole it's this just all

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:40.360
internal relations by definition there's

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.880
no yeah let put together another piece

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.760
of my own puzzle because part of where

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.320
that came from is I know I think I

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.800
shared here maybe I did anyway a couple

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.080
of weeks ago I had a nephew who died

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.800
suddenly by a stroke

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.800
BR the entire family all of our

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.800
differences disappeared and this just

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.719
relatedness that's it there's nothing

01:29:00.719 --> 01:29:02.920
else there's just we're all tightly

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.080
bound and all the extraneous stuff that

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:07.960
we have differentiated from is like gone

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.880
in a

01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.119
moment that's one piece the other piece

01:29:11.119 --> 01:29:12.960
is I think I shared this here a year or

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.760
two ago but um I had this memory of this

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.840
woman I worked with in the 70s and the

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.760
thought of her brought me joy and I

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:25.560
thought well how who else there so I

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.440
ended up making a list I ended up with

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.360
1160 something and again what I

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:33.520
recognized about that is none of their

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:35.360
idiosyncrasy stayed me something about

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.239
their Essence stayed with me and is now

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:40.360
part of me that I cannot separate myself

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.960
from so how many of the many can I

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:45.719
include in

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.440
here yeah so there's something about

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:53.960
how you want to collapse not collapse is

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.199
the wrong word but I'm going to use it

01:29:55.199 --> 01:29:56.800
because I can't think of anything else

01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.840
like it's really sweet when the the

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:01.800
relations collapse to this shared

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.639
interiority right all the the the

01:30:04.639 --> 01:30:07.080
Resonance of the in the internal

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.239
relations and yet the other is remains

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.679
irreducible right you can't reduce the

01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:17.080
other to the internal relations these

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.480
things have to be held at the same the

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.840
same time gluons

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.920
gluons is that how they work well no

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.960
gluons hold the the protons and the

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.440
neutrons together okay yeah they're

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:33.040
distinct but they're bound right

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.520
actually I was thinking of researching

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.960
the five the fundamental forces to see

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.639
if I could but I'm not gonna do that for

01:30:39.639 --> 01:30:42.920
this book anyways so yeah so that's

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:46.080
something to to understand that

01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:48.080
everything is collapsible to internal

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.920
relations because we came from this one

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.920
compound individ idual but that the in

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.760
the other is IR at the same time

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.080
irreducible to the set of internal

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:01.400
relations because of all this other

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.360
stuff that's going on um but neither

01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.040
should we just look at all this other

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:10.639
stuff that's going on and so so you

01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:12.800
could call both those moves

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.800
complexification but that's

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.280
not there're really two different kinds

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.040
of moves one

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:23.760
is yeah um

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.400
reminding me a long time ago of this

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.520
video that you put on one of the in one

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:39.119
of the um uh meetings it was it was it

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:43.080
was kind of this globu that was always

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.800
kind of expanding from the inside and

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:46.840
had lots of individual particular things

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.400
that were kind of expanding and the

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.840
whole thing was kind of expanding out um

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:54.360
and I guess the origin story you're

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.360
trying to say is to look from a to look

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.920
at that thing and explain it in a way

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.679
did you know the the image that I'm

01:32:01.679 --> 01:32:04.239
talking about yeah it'd be cool to keep

01:32:04.239 --> 01:32:08.159
get an image 3D mandle brute set yeah

01:32:08.159 --> 01:32:10.719
yeah because maybe we're trying to kind

01:32:10.719 --> 01:32:12.679
of say what that thing is from one of

01:32:12.679 --> 01:32:15.320
these exploding particulars in a way

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:19.480
aren't we and um uh it'd be nice to get

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.080
that kind of that really stayed with me

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.199
anyway um in this multimedia book that

01:32:24.199 --> 01:32:26.360
you're going to be producing it's not

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:31.520
gonna be multimedia but I realized

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:34.360
something um which I don't think there

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:36.880
was a confusion at the time but for

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.320
example remember we were saying you look

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:41.960
inside and it's my brain and it looks

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.800
less like a calculator more like Pond

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.119
life well it actually doesn't look like

01:32:47.119 --> 01:32:50.080
Pond life like in my gut where there's a

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.080
lot of bacteria that looks like Pond

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.480
life because my gut is really the

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:57.000
habitat for the bacteria that have

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.800
internal and external relationships but

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.960
but they they actually have a lot more

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.560
external relationships but in my brain

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.360
it doesn't look like Pond life because

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.320
they internal relationships are

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.000
so they're so P primary that the neurons

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.280
don't compete with each other for re

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.119
they kind of do but it's not like Pond

01:33:20.119 --> 01:33:21.800
life where Pond life things are eating

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.560
each other and this and that there's a

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.639
shared identity and so when you ask

01:33:26.639 --> 01:33:31.400
yourself why are neurons unlike the eoli

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.639
in my stomach they're just they're just

01:33:33.639 --> 01:33:36.159
doing what they would do in a pond right

01:33:36.159 --> 01:33:39.920
why are they contributing to this this

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.320
compound

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:42.960
individual

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:47.719
um and so one could say because they

01:33:47.719 --> 01:33:51.760
have the same origin right the same they

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.159
can trace themselves back to

01:33:54.159 --> 01:33:59.360
the fet the the the Inception okay so

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.440
they trace themselves back to this event

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.360
in

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.119
time which of course traces back traces

01:34:06.119 --> 01:34:08.600
back traces back

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.719
whereas the

01:34:10.719 --> 01:34:13.719
bacteria

01:34:14.239 --> 01:34:17.480
in yeah it gets complicated but anyways

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:19.880
it's not like Pond life in the sense

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:23.199
that pond life is a itive with of

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.440
external mostly external but also some

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:30.000
Ingress relationships whereas your brain

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.520
is in a sense more like Pond life but

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:36.199
it's it's more of a part of a compound

01:34:36.199 --> 01:34:38.840
individual it's very confusing when you

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.199
talk about it but that's the territory

01:34:42.199 --> 01:34:46.080
so Phoebe help us out she she's weaving

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.440
she's knitting something and I'm

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.000
beginning to think this has got to be

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.480
knitted

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.159
together the babies

01:34:53.159 --> 01:34:55.600
do

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.320
shortly okay so it's a good thing that I

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.000
like myself in general because when I'm

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.679
in this

01:35:02.679 --> 01:35:04.600
class

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:08.199
uh I don't know who the I am and I

01:35:08.199 --> 01:35:10.320
don't know I don't get any of the stuff

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:16.000
you guys are talking about any of it

01:35:16.119 --> 01:35:20.400
so I'll take this candy out of my mouth

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.639
so I want to see if I can articulate an

01:35:23.639 --> 01:35:28.600
experience of a sense of

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:32.280
something new and

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.800
real uh and I don't know if I can

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:39.719
because this is so like in a way it's a

01:35:39.719 --> 01:35:44.280
cold space it's so intellectual I cannot

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.440
with my

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.000
mind

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.920
reconstitute

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.880
or refer from one thing to another

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.920
experiences which are in their in the

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.000
direct experience which brings me

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.480
something new expands me I have it a new

01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:04.360
experience of myself kind of in living

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.560
truth there's a there's a there's a

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.320
sense of

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.639
um like so just recently

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.719
um oh God I don't know if I can

01:36:22.719 --> 01:36:26.000
reproduce it but

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.280
um a sense of

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.920
becoming more and as I'm tuning into my

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:38.239
experience and tuning into relationship

01:36:38.239 --> 01:36:39.199
more and

01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:41.880
more weightless more

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:45.880
light not so much light filled with the

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:48.000
physical light although that may also be

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.600
the case but but more uh but less and

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.239
less

01:36:53.239 --> 01:36:55.040
weighted

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:59.239
by something that maybe is prior to who

01:36:59.239 --> 01:37:01.080
I am now

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.800
becoming and in that state there's a

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.239
sense

01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:08.760
of

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:11.040
following

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.600
um of of being

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.080
joined and in being in the flow and of

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.840
being um and and being able to trust and

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.600
this is just the trust is uh almost

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.360
experimental it's like who knows

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.400
but but being light enough that I can

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.960
sense a flow that feels good if I join

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.480
it let's put it that way okay so that's

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.960
that's an experience that I've been

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:42.119
having something like

01:37:42.119 --> 01:37:44.880
that but I

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.400
don't and so there's a knowing you could

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.199
say in that

01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:52.199
experience

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:55.480
um it's not

01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.560
cognitive but there's the experience

01:38:04.199 --> 01:38:06.159
itself

01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:08.000
feels

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
good

01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:15.719
and feels more real than what I was

01:38:15.719 --> 01:38:19.199
experiencing before who I was before so

01:38:19.199 --> 01:38:22.360
there's a sense of a becoming

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:24.880
happening so when you said you know

01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.599
we're all in the middle everything's in

01:38:26.599 --> 01:38:27.480
the middle that's the only thing that

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:30.400
makes sense to me and then how would I

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.119
relate that to An Origin story if I I

01:38:34.119 --> 01:38:36.480
just I don't even know if I should

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.679
continue to try to do this work Bonnie

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:41.880
because I can't my mind can't do any I

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.840
can't I can't F I don't know all these

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:46.280
theories you're referring to and they

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.080
don't um they don't live they don't

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.440
resonate in me they don't find lodging

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.760
anywhere inside of me maybe that's just

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.920
the way I'm made up and and even if they

01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.440
did find lodging I wouldn't be able to

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:01.920
find him the next time because I can't

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.719
hold on to him

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.400
so so I don't know on the one hand I'm

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.599
saying I'm not sure if I should be here

01:39:12.599 --> 01:39:14.960
literally and

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:17.280
on and on the other hand I thought well

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:19.639
let me just say something that feels

01:39:19.639 --> 01:39:23.040
real for me

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.679
to see if

01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:28.880
there's any way that that

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:33.599
uh belongs in this

01:39:33.599 --> 01:39:35.920
discussion and then if I were to try to

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:39.080
talk about an origin

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.679
story the only thing I would say is

01:39:42.679 --> 01:39:44.239
whatever I'm

01:39:44.239 --> 01:39:49.159
experiencing that that that's part of

01:39:49.159 --> 01:39:52.000
it and I don't want to try to think it

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.960
because if I think it I'm not in it I'm

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:58.760
not parti I'm not participating so

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.159
ultimately I guess it would be

01:40:00.159 --> 01:40:02.760
participatory it's just this the feeling

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.040
of being in

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.119
participation that's all I can say I

01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:09.480
can't say

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.199
anymore

01:40:14.199 --> 01:40:16.760
Justin yeah I just want to respond to my

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.719
friend

01:40:17.719 --> 01:40:20.679
Phoebe um because I don't understand a

01:40:20.679 --> 01:40:22.800
fraction I mean small pieces of what

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.639
goes on here and it doesn't matter to me

01:40:25.639 --> 01:40:27.159
um there are certain things that

01:40:27.159 --> 01:40:28.719
resonate with me that I will carry with

01:40:28.719 --> 01:40:30.480
me forever and the rest of it's out in

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:33.320
space of mine and that's fine because

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.520
whatever it is that calls to me wants me

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.440
here and that I am clear about so you

01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.400
know take the energy in and grab what

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.480
you can at least from my perspective and

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.480
let the rest of it go it doesn't matter

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.840
at least from one

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.920
perspective

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:57.320
I'm getting knitting

01:41:05.719 --> 01:41:09.800
done I think I get what you mean

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.840
Phoebe

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.080
I'll also say it's not just ideas the

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.920
feel of the space will stick with me

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.560
forever too it's like collecting an

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.199
individual except it's collecting and

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:49.360
Collective well maybe if I could be as

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.800
lighthearted as you are about Justin I

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.800
could uh have more availability to the

01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:01.000
feeling of the space and um but I'm I'm

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.480
I'm not number crunching I'm thought

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:05.920
crunching or I'm not doing that but I'm

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.400
thinking oh my God there's a lot of

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.960
thought crunching going on and I don't

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.719
know how to do

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.320
it that sounds like what uh Bonnie is

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.040
doing with this present

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:25.360
elaboration of all that you said

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:29.199
recently so you're riding in the

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:44.400
ballpark I'm going into h a Catholic

01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.760
mass in a few hours and I don't follow

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:49.719
the politics of the Catholic church I do

01:42:49.719 --> 01:42:51.679
follow some of its

01:42:51.679 --> 01:42:55.199
principles uh but I love the recreation

01:42:55.199 --> 01:42:57.760
of the last supper and to me Christ is

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.199
the same as

01:42:59.199 --> 01:43:02.639
Shiva perennial wisdom and

01:43:02.639 --> 01:43:06.320
whatnot but uh I was raised Catholic uh

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.199
12 years an altar boy I was raised by my

01:43:09.199 --> 01:43:11.040
mother I was running around the house of

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.440
the priest as she was taking care of the

01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:14.400
priest and the whole church I could have

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:17.679
been a priest but she um but uh that

01:43:17.679 --> 01:43:20.199
wasn't my path but I go in and I

01:43:20.199 --> 01:43:22.560
meditate during the mass you know I I

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:25.360
call it my Transcendent practice to

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.080
participate uh from a different

01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:30.119
perspective and and so that's uh Marie

01:43:30.119 --> 01:43:31.520
was talking about that and everyone's

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.440
talked about some of the Catholicism not

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.679
everyone but uh uh so I practice it to a

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:42.360
certain degree but as a a creation

01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:44.920
aspect of part of the greater whole of

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:47.760
which went in that came from wherever it

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:50.280
all came from uh the Big Bang or

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.800
whatever

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:54.360
and um to me it's part of the whole

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:55.800
simulation of it

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.800
all and we're all part of it from the

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:00.960
big banger from whatever so it's not

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:03.080
just we're absent little particles in it

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:05.800
we're we're creating as we go along and

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.599
yeah I agree there's no future tomorrow

01:44:08.599 --> 01:44:10.239
but we are creating that future with our

01:44:10.239 --> 01:44:12.760
own intentions and following the paths

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.400
of the meaningful ques or the

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.440
synchronicities that take us along

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.000
according to my personal attention

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.119
intentions anyway and or all all of our

01:44:24.119 --> 01:44:26.119
intentions whether or not they're

01:44:26.119 --> 01:44:30.159
concrete or not but anyway say Bonnie on

01:44:30.159 --> 01:44:32.480
on that next course is happening in the

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.560
year uh are you participating in that

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.000
too you said you not even sure you're

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.159
invited what in the

01:44:41.159 --> 01:44:44.440
Retreats uh yeah those physical Retreats

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.440
yeah but they're not courses I mean they

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.880
look like courses well yeah

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:51.719
because for people who who don't already

01:44:51.719 --> 01:44:54.480
know each other in the popup school like

01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.239
a lot of people okay so the big a big

01:44:57.239 --> 01:44:59.040
reason why it's there so everybody can

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.840
go to Sky meow which is beautiful and

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.159
hang out together but that's the draw

01:45:03.159 --> 01:45:05.239
because you are all already know each

01:45:05.239 --> 01:45:09.080
other to get people outside of the popup

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.840
school to try to grow the community it

01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.960
has to sound a little bit more like

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.080
there's some you know there's there is I

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:16.840
mean we'll be doing what I said but it's

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:18.920
not going to be more you know it's not

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.360
going to be more like a it'll be much

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.719
less like a course right um so

01:45:25.719 --> 01:45:28.599
um yeah no that's perfect yeah no that's

01:45:28.599 --> 01:45:31.040
perfect we'll form form our own creation

01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:33.280
story from it and that's helping me go

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.920
into the bigger Circle which is where I

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.280
want to go yeah we're not going into

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:40.520
those retreats to continue this year's

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:43.880
work we're going to look at whatever the

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:47.599
natural state is um so just kind of

01:45:47.599 --> 01:45:49.800
learn you know gently attending to

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:52.480
experience

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.960
um yeah and doing some chanting and some

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:00.520
movement work with Aaron and preparing

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.760
food together breakfast and lunch will

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.239
be preparing as a

01:46:04.239 --> 01:46:07.960
community um hanging out by the fire

01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.599
pit

01:46:09.599 --> 01:46:13.760
um and um we'll be doing some uh

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.040
community-led practices in the afternoon

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:20.080
session so if anybody has a practice

01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:24.040
that they want to um lead for the group

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:26.000
they'll be able to do that things like

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.239
that um much more open space than than

01:46:30.239 --> 01:46:31.080
uh

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:32.719
actually

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:36.119
um it's not it's definitely not a course

01:46:36.119 --> 01:46:37.880
um it's laid out as a course because if

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.239
you're G to put up a website you want

01:46:39.239 --> 01:46:41.639
people to register for something it it

01:46:41.639 --> 01:46:43.320
it definitely needs to look like they're

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:44.880
registering for something and it is

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.080
something but yeah it's not more

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:49.520
rigorous than this and certainly this

01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.520
year we you know you know the background

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:54.679
materials were all experiential getting

01:46:54.679 --> 01:46:55.960
understanding what was happening in our

01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:59.840
body and this is the

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:02.800
um this is

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.560
the kind

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.639
of artifact of creating trying to create

01:47:07.639 --> 01:47:09.599
new expressions of

01:47:09.599 --> 01:47:14.080
something um portions of

01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.440
[Music]

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:21.000
it but yeah it's that of course it's say

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.840
it's a it's a retreat for

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:27.719
us perfect perfect thank

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.840
you I may be off TB um who you were

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:56.679
before you were becoming what you're

01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:21.480
becoming Phoebe did you hear hear that

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:24.239
St I think Steve asked your

01:48:24.239 --> 01:48:27.239
question

01:48:46.599 --> 01:48:50.239
oh bunny I hope that what I said what

01:48:50.239 --> 01:48:52.560
wasn't

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.719
insulting no I

01:48:55.719 --> 01:48:59.639
mean I get it like a lot of what goes on

01:48:59.639 --> 01:49:03.280
in this kind of conversation is we've

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.639
all read the same thing so when we say

01:49:05.639 --> 01:49:08.360
this is like that it's a it's a quick

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.000
metaphor you know like somebody can say

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.520
oh that's like the statue at in the per

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.080
in you know the square in Paris and it

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:18.880
it wouldn't mean anything to me if it

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:21.520
wasn't unpacked so there's a lot of that

01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:27.320
going on um but uh so it's obvious to me

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.400
why these things don't land and it could

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:35.639
be boring uh even worse than boring but

01:49:35.639 --> 01:49:37.880
I think that

01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:42.199
um hopefully the end product won't feel

01:49:42.199 --> 01:49:44.760
won't feel so when I what I'm going to

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.119
try to do is is you know there will be

01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:51.400
some

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:52.800
I don't know how I'm going to write it

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.199
but I'm going to try to write it in such

01:49:55.199 --> 01:49:58.880
a way there will be some

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.080
um signifiers like this but that it also

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.599
has a message that might land in other

01:50:04.599 --> 01:50:07.719
ways I don't know it's it's not it's not

01:50:07.719 --> 01:50:11.320
easy to uh I don't I can't imagine the

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:13.480
book I can just write it and then see

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.440
what

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.440
happens

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.239
um the thing is there's a lot of people

01:50:20.239 --> 01:50:22.199
that have been writing origin stories

01:50:22.199 --> 01:50:24.199
especially

01:50:24.199 --> 01:50:27.440
recently and it's interesting

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.119
phenomenon uh like Marie said the people

01:50:31.119 --> 01:50:33.400
in Italy have an origin story it's very

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:36.280
simple it gets paired down over time you

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.280
know it's actually gets simpler over

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:39.920
time

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.239
um and and it works

01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:48.719
and yeah it's interesting to me about

01:50:48.719 --> 01:50:51.400
origin stories

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.440
or Charles eisenstein you know we need a

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:54.599
new

01:50:54.599 --> 01:50:57.599
story

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.280
um I don't know if the story here

01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.239
actually works s but it has currency and

01:51:22.239 --> 01:51:28.040
that's what is kind of the thing that is

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:32.400
um curious for me like walking into

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.360
churches and that were not easy to

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:41.159
build um and and people there enacting

01:51:41.159 --> 01:51:45.320
ritual in a way that feels as though it

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:48.000
has strong

01:51:48.040 --> 01:51:50.560
meaning um

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:54.360
still today you know

01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.440
after after so much time has passed so

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.119
how H how that kind of resonance gets

01:52:02.119 --> 01:52:06.679
passed on is I'm really curious about

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:11.520
it and and I think also what Phoebe said

01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:13.920
I mean it's totally resonant for me in

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.440
the sense

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.880
that I

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.719
mean

01:52:20.719 --> 01:52:26.599
I used to feel like I had a coherent

01:52:26.599 --> 01:52:31.280
worldview um or a sense

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:35.320
of um you know the way what I knew and

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:38.159
how I knew it sort of fit together in a

01:52:38.159 --> 01:52:40.440
in a coherent way

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:43.440
and

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:51.040
um and I I I think think what goes on

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:54.960
for me and here I know

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:58.760
for Ry and I both oftentimes the

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:03.880
conversation post popup school class is

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:06.360
like did you

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.560
understand what people were on about

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:16.520
there and and oftentimes it's the answer

01:53:16.679 --> 01:53:20.840
is um not so much

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:23.400
or a little bit here I got this thread

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:26.000
or I didn't get that thread or this

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.880
resonated for me or that

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.000
didn't and and and yet I think this has

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.880
been said by others around how there's

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.679
there's something

01:53:38.679 --> 01:53:43.440
underlying that is

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:49.199
um more more significant that is you

01:53:49.199 --> 01:53:51.880
know that I think we we

01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:57.079
tap and um and and that sense of things

01:53:57.079 --> 01:54:00.159
coming in and out of

01:54:00.159 --> 01:54:03.520
focus or in and out of coherence feels

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:07.599
like a part of the experience of having

01:54:07.599 --> 01:54:10.599
let go of I don't know if you will an

01:54:10.599 --> 01:54:14.440
old story or an old sense of I got this

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:17.719
I know I know something and letting go

01:54:17.719 --> 01:54:22.560
of that and and and then kind of in that

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:26.480
unraveling sort of trying to

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:28.119
know

01:54:28.119 --> 01:54:31.000
differently and and I I always come back

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.800
to how

01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:36.920
here the the invitation ultimately is

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:40.079
to um know ourselves and know our

01:54:40.079 --> 01:54:42.880
experience know self other

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.639
world

01:54:44.639 --> 01:54:48.199
differently um than we're used to like

01:54:48.199 --> 01:54:51.239
and sometimes it's a

01:54:51.239 --> 01:54:52.350
weird

01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:53.599
[Music]

01:54:53.599 --> 01:54:57.679
um uh I can't say the word right now

01:54:57.679 --> 01:55:00.920
aoral experience of

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:05.040
like where it

01:55:05.159 --> 01:55:07.560
comes because there are things that I

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:10.400
know that still I still can know them

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.520
like it's not like you throw the baby

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.960
out with the bath water it's like but it

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.040
it's sort of like their are currents of

01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:19.400
things that come through and it's like

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:21.320
oh yeah that's really familiar I know

01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.639
that and I can trust

01:55:23.639 --> 01:55:26.520
it and then and then it slips to

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.000
something I don't know so well and or

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:37.800
new language or I don't know um that's

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:40.400
just

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.440
um that's just kind of my dance with it

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.480
with it

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.960
all I just before we go to Matt I just

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:51.599
want to say also like part of it is

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.679
the you know things that we've read but

01:55:54.679 --> 01:55:57.280
also part of it is like we'll be in the

01:55:57.280 --> 01:55:59.520
middle of this thing we were last time

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.880
and we're all talking about this and

01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.520
then and then uh because I just want to

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:06.360
I want just want to separate the fact

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.440
that there's some cognitive signifiers

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:10.760
that are very intellectual versus what's

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.119
actually going on here also and that is

01:56:13.119 --> 01:56:15.000
we'll be in the middle of something and

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.040
then Kevin will say you know that's like

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.199
when Wy coyote is chasing the Road

01:56:19.199 --> 01:56:20.719
Runner and he takes the paint and he

01:56:20.719 --> 01:56:22.960
paints a c he paints a cave and he runs

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.560
through it and Riley cut okay that's not

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.400
very sophisticated language but you're

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:32.719
trying to like follow these leaps so so

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:34.639
I mean part of the problem is following

01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:37.280
these leaps and then the secondary

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:39.320
problem with what we just T what we just

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:41.960
got into was more of using these

01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:44.400
intellectual signifiers I get that but

01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:48.079
it's also difficult to follow like why

01:56:48.079 --> 01:56:50.719
is that relevant like like if I was just

01:56:50.719 --> 01:56:54.079
an intellectual pundit I'd be like why

01:56:54.079 --> 01:56:56.560
is that even relevant like but I like

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:59.599
it's it's it's being trying to be able

01:56:59.599 --> 01:57:03.480
to this is a collective mind and this

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:04.880
would never that would have never

01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.760
happened in my mind and maybe in phoe's

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.760
mind what Justin said would never have

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:13.360
happened or like and the whole point is

01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.679
is to imagine that this is being popped

01:57:17.679 --> 01:57:20.679
this stuff is popping up into your mind

01:57:20.679 --> 01:57:23.679
your mind not from other people and that

01:57:23.679 --> 01:57:25.960
will rewire your mind whether you

01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:28.560
understand it or not I mean like what

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:30.599
like so

01:57:30.599 --> 01:57:34.760
so um that's part that's that's part of

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:38.280
the the process is all this all this

01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:43.000
stuff is is in our Collective mind so um

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
some people might not have understood

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.960
why Kevin Kevin said what he did

01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.679
why does that make a connection I don't

01:57:51.679 --> 01:57:56.000
know um but again there's two levels

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.239
then

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.920
there's if if you had never seen the

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:03.199
Road Runner and he said it really fast

01:58:03.199 --> 01:58:05.000
you would have never even have a chance

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.480
of understanding why what he said may

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.800
fit into the

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:12.360
conversation um but um if you've never

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.840
read like when I say Brendan gmy and his

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:18.440
emergences there's a lot already packed

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:20.040
into that that is part of the

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:23.320
conversation that just it doesn't it's

01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.159
like never having seen the Road Runner I

01:58:26.159 --> 01:58:27.679
I spent a lot of time thinking about

01:58:27.679 --> 01:58:30.000
that by the way in one of my 18-hour

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.639
naps I was thinking about the role of

01:58:32.639 --> 01:58:35.800
the an animator of course that's how the

01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:37.920
animator would think about creativity

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:40.719
because he's he's drawing something and

01:58:40.719 --> 01:58:42.719
it it's creating a reality so why can't

01:58:42.719 --> 01:58:44.199
the thing he's drawing and create a

01:58:44.199 --> 01:58:46.560
reality that's part of reality that's I

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:51.320
mean it was great Matthew

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:55.920
did you get the Road Runner thing

01:58:56.639 --> 01:58:59.440
Matthew yeah

01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:01.719
yeah

01:59:01.719 --> 01:59:05.480
uh but

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:09.679
like like I I don't know I don't know I

01:59:09.679 --> 01:59:12.520
think so like I get I get it but also I

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.239
can see how it could be a different way

01:59:15.239 --> 01:59:18.000
than I the way I get it so I don't know

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.239
but um

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:26.880
uh yeah I I thought of two things I

01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:29.360
think the first thing

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:32.719
was yeah like like phebe I definitely

01:59:32.719 --> 01:59:34.679
recently for sure have been feeling I I

01:59:34.679 --> 01:59:37.119
think similar

01:59:37.119 --> 01:59:40.440
um uh but today this morning when we

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:42.199
just started I think I

01:59:42.199 --> 01:59:44.560
realized you know people were talking

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:48.599
and I was kind of like not understanding

01:59:48.599 --> 01:59:51.040
and I just kind of had a little mini

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:54.040
Insight of like it really occurred to

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.440
me more than I've like I've

01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:58.280
intellectually thought this before but I

01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.679
kind of am starting to realize it

02:00:00.679 --> 02:00:03.320
now that how

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:06.840
different other people's experiences and

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:09.679
ways they think can

02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:12.719
be like that I don't know that just

02:00:12.719 --> 02:00:15.400
really occurred to me was like oh like

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:20.760
other people really do see think

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:25.960
feel differently or they can so that was

02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:28.960
interesting

02:00:29.199 --> 02:00:34.119
um and then I guess the other thought I

02:00:34.119 --> 02:00:36.800
had was like oh yeah like I think

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:39.320
JJ I remember he came on once and I

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.000
think he'd be he'd been gone for a while

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.480
and I think he said like oh yeah you

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.920
just took a little break and that was

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:48.760
really nice and I know for me like just

02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.520
yeah taking breaks from things help just

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:54.400
kind of reorient you don't feel it you

02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:57.800
don't feel it I

02:01:03.719 --> 02:01:06.800
know I wonder when you say that we're

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.480
all part of a collective mind I mean

02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:11.560
maybe there's a larger human Collective

02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:14.159
mind and there's a collective

02:01:14.159 --> 02:01:17.480
here and I wonder whether the Road

02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:22.560
Runner jumping into to Kevin's

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:26.920
mind you know it's a it's part

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:29.480
of what's sort

02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:32.800
of streaming through the collective here

02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:34.480
it's showing up for some people in terms

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.320
of their associations with intellectual

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:41.719
material that they've are familiar with

02:01:41.719 --> 02:01:45.199
um and

02:01:45.639 --> 02:01:49.119
uh and I like the idea that if there is

02:01:49.119 --> 02:01:51.320
if we're all together participating in

02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:54.520
something that I mean I like Justin's

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:56.920
idea that you know just you just hang in

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.520
there and see what

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:01.599
resonates um I had a I was trying to

02:02:01.599 --> 02:02:04.679
figure out make a decision this morning

02:02:04.679 --> 02:02:09.159
about um which stove to buy from my

02:02:09.159 --> 02:02:11.320
house that I'm used to live in and I'm

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:15.599
now renting and so I decided to use

02:02:15.599 --> 02:02:18.320
drawing because I couldn't figure it out

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:19.719
in my mind

02:02:19.719 --> 02:02:23.760
so I I went to the paper and I

02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.520
immediately started to

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:29.400
cry because what there was before I even

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:30.400
drew

02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:34.719
the p uh the stove was my relationship

02:02:34.719 --> 02:02:36.040
with the

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.920
house and um if ID stayed in my

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.920
thinking I wouldn't

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:45.880
have realized that that there's this

02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:50.119
huge current underneath this indecision

02:02:50.119 --> 02:02:52.599
of I have to let this house

02:02:52.599 --> 02:02:56.119
go and the feeling of of of the house

02:02:56.119 --> 02:02:58.440
because I was going to do something with

02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:01.400
a crayon and a piece of paper I was

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:03.360
coming physical then I got the the

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:06.520
physical experience of my my

02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.159
relationship to the

02:03:08.159 --> 02:03:14.320
house and um so I bring that in

02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.000
because you know that's another way of

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.880
knowing that is

02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:27.119
operative um I mostly find that's where

02:03:27.119 --> 02:03:29.760
things that's a very active way for me

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:32.079
to to know what I

02:03:32.079 --> 02:03:34.719
know and then I decided you know what I

02:03:34.719 --> 02:03:36.079
don't want to make this decision about

02:03:36.079 --> 02:03:39.880
the Stu I'm gonna let the house make the

02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:45.000
decision so it did I do both stoves and

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.199
I said okay house which one do you want

02:03:47.199 --> 02:03:50.760
this one

02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:53.880
so anyways I I I like the idea that

02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:57.079
we're participating together and that

02:03:57.079 --> 02:03:58.360
we're all

02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.360
bringing

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:05.159
different sensitivity sensibilities and

02:04:05.159 --> 02:04:08.119
that things are moving through us and

02:04:08.119 --> 02:04:10.880
that I don't have

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:15.159
to try to make my mind bend the way it

02:04:15.159 --> 02:04:16.760
doesn't want to

02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:19.320
bend and uh

02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.920
when I was I was I actually took one

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.960
semester of a PhD course and then was

02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.960
online and I I didn't want to do it and

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:28.599
it was at California Institute of

02:04:28.599 --> 02:04:30.800
integral studies in transformation and

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:32.960
change or something like that and we

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:35.000
were asked to compare these different

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.079
articles and I couldn't do it I couldn't

02:04:39.079 --> 02:04:43.079
read different articles and then on the

02:04:43.079 --> 02:04:46.000
surface interrelate

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.559
them I I couldn't my mind couldn't

02:04:49.559 --> 02:04:52.400
hold them in this sort of generalized

02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:55.960
way or or so I would dive into an

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:59.239
article and then be in relationship with

02:04:59.239 --> 02:05:01.559
what was there and then dive into

02:05:01.559 --> 02:05:03.360
another article and so it's from the

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:05.880
inter relationship that things started

02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:08.320
to weave and and meaning was made but I

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:11.360
couldn't just do it on the surface so

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:13.000
now that I'm getting older I'm like oh

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.719
good I'll let that one

02:05:14.719 --> 02:05:18.040
go I'm probably getting lazy too but

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:20.079
anyways that's a about

02:05:20.079 --> 02:05:23.360
me I also want to say another thing I

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.880
mean I think one of the

02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:29.400
things that we are actually practicing

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:34.159
here um us intellectuals those who

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:37.000
who shot off a lot of intellectual

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.760
pieces what might consider intellectual

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:43.400
is in no sense does anyone I don't sense

02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:46.159
it and I'm sure pretty sure I would say

02:05:46.159 --> 02:05:49.400
sure that there was no usure for this

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.159
thing to line up perfectly like whatever

02:05:52.159 --> 02:05:54.119
Steve said and then Kimberly said and

02:05:54.119 --> 02:05:56.239
then Jessica said about we weren't

02:05:56.239 --> 02:05:59.559
trying to line them up we weren't being

02:05:59.559 --> 02:06:01.760
theoretic about our intellectual

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:04.040
statements we were being lyric it was

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:06.159
just like oh that's just we our

02:06:06.159 --> 02:06:08.440
relationship was that they hung in the

02:06:08.440 --> 02:06:12.639
space just like just like uh

02:06:12.639 --> 02:06:15.559
Kevin's uh uh Road Runner thing hung in

02:06:15.559 --> 02:06:19.199
the space and that's different than an a

02:06:19.199 --> 02:06:21.639
traditional philosophic theoretic where

02:06:21.639 --> 02:06:23.960
he says something and then we're driving

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:26.000
it home and I'm comparing to what he

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.040
said we're just we're just allowing

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:32.480
these to be creative in this space so

02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:36.920
and there's not a uh

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:41.360
um there's no none of that what that we

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:45.400
aren't holding the intellectual

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:49.639
artifacts in a kind of Newtonian linear

02:06:49.639 --> 02:06:54.159
narrative um if I we couldn't even go

02:06:54.159 --> 02:06:56.320
and say well this is what we said we're

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.960
not build so so that's what I think

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:01.159
we're all doing

02:07:01.159 --> 02:07:05.000
um which is different than um if you've

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.719
been to you know the Symposium I've been

02:07:07.719 --> 02:07:10.400
to where

02:07:11.079 --> 02:07:13.800
like they're actually theore

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.079
philosophical theoretical Pursuits where

02:07:16.079 --> 02:07:19.400
you're trying to

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:22.079
I don't know what you're trying to do

02:07:22.079 --> 02:07:24.159
trying to put constructs together in a

02:07:24.159 --> 02:07:27.079
nice linear fashion and build something

02:07:27.079 --> 02:07:28.320
very

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.400
tidy um yeah so in that sense we're

02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:34.360
doing the same same thing Matthew do you

02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:36.599
have a hands up or was that an artifact

02:07:36.599 --> 02:07:39.119
from the past it's an artifact from the

02:07:39.119 --> 02:07:41.480
past see

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:43.840
that okay my friends thanks for bringing

02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:49.079
it up Phoebe it's it's another wrap for

02:07:49.079 --> 02:07:50.360
this

02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:53.320
um this this module I think you'll find

02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.280
the next module uh

02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:59.920
more uh kind of understandable the third

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:03.360
one on the moral animal is going to be

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.360
uh a big one but it's more

02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:10.119
about um

02:08:10.119 --> 02:08:13.199
sharing you know what are Moral Moral

02:08:13.199 --> 02:08:16.400
Junctions that we've had in our lives um

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.520
do we have a moral code is do we really

02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:20.960
have a moral code do I really like chws

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.079
based on a certain morality I don't know

02:08:23.079 --> 02:08:24.400
we're going to examine our own

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.840
relationship to to

02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:29.800
morality um the next two are I mean

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.760
Origins is a very yeah we've discovered

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:36.559
it's a very FAL or

02:08:36.559 --> 02:08:41.559
elusive uh topic so um if nothing else

02:08:41.559 --> 02:08:44.159
it's very curious because we all been

02:08:44.159 --> 02:08:46.960
told origin stories there's all cultures

02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:50.760
built on them and uh there s kinds of

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:53.400
things so I thank you for sticking with

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:57.800
us and um see you I guess we start again

02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:00.840
on Saturday because we we have this late

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:05.320
class okay thank you very much it's so

02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:08.440
wrap
